&gt; 
&gt; SCOPE:
&gt; 
&gt; The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds great 
&gt; promise for individuals and society. From convenience for consumers and 
&gt; efficiency in commerce to improved public health and safety and 
&gt; increased participation in democratic institutions, these technologies 
&gt; can fundamentally transform our lives.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of a free 
&gt; and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk from invasion 
&gt; by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The myriad databases 
&gt; containing personal information maintained in the public and private 
&gt; sectors expose private life to constant scrutiny.
&gt; 
&gt; Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, posing 
&gt; new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and challenging the 
&gt; very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But technologies used to 
&gt; combat these crimes can pose new threats to freedom and privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are being 
&gt; transformed by these technologies, throwing into question the basic 
&gt; Constitutional protections that have guarded them. Similarly, 
&gt; information knows no borders; as the scope of economies becomes global 
&gt; and as networked communities transcend international boundaries, ways 
&gt; must be found to reconcile competing political, social and economic 
&gt; interests in the digital domain.
&gt; 
&gt; The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble 
&gt; experts, advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of 
&gt; disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum to address the 
&gt; impact of computer and telecommunications technologies on freedom and 
&gt; privacy in society. Participants will include people from the fields of 
&gt; computer science, law, business, research, information, library science, 
&gt; health, public policy, government, law enforcement, public advocacy and 
&gt; many others.

&gt; 
&gt; Pre-Conference Tutorials:
&gt; On Tuesday 9 March, the day before the formal conference begins, CFP'93
&gt; is offering a number of in-depth tutorials on a wide variety of subjects
&gt; on four parallel tracks. These presentations will range from interesting
&gt; and informative to thought-provoking and controversial. The tutorials
&gt; are available at a nominal additional registration cost.
&gt; 
&gt; Conference Reception:
&gt; Following the Tutorials on Tuesday evening, you are invited to meet new 
&gt; and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception. 
&gt; 
&gt; Single Track Main Program:
&gt; The technological revolution that is driving change in our society has
&gt; many facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit together,
&gt; especially the parts that lie outside of our own expertise and interest.
&gt; The primary goal of CFP'93 is to bring together individuals from
&gt; disparate disciplines and backgrounds, and engage them in a balanced
&gt; discussion of all CFP issues. To this end our main program, starting on
&gt; Wednesday 10 March, is on a single track enabling our attendees to take
&gt; part in all sessions.
&gt; 
&gt; Registration is Limited:
&gt; CFP'93 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise you 
&gt; to register as early as possible and take advantage of the early 
&gt; registration discounts.
&gt; 
&gt; Luncheons and Banquets:
&gt; A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction between
&gt; the diverse communities that constitute our attendees. To promote this
&gt; interaction CFP'93 is providing three luncheons and evening two banquets
&gt; with the cost of conference registration.
&gt; 
&gt; EFF Pioneer Awards
&gt; All conference attendees are invited to the Awards Reception sponsored 
&gt; by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on Wednesday evening, 10 
&gt; March. These, the second annual EFF Pioneer Awards, will be given to 
&gt; individuals and organizations that have made distinguished contributions 
&gt; to the human and technological realms touched by computer-based 
&gt; communications.
&gt; 
&gt; Birds of a Feather Sessions:
&gt; CFP'93 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to interested 
&gt; individuals for special Birds of a Feather sessions after the formal 
&gt; program each evening. These sessions will provide an opportunity for 
&gt; special interest discussions that were not included in the formal 
&gt; program and will be listed in the conference materials. For further

&gt; Willis H. Ware has devoted his career to all aspects of computer 
&gt; science--hardware, software, architectures, software development, public 
&gt; policy and legislation. He chaired the "HEW committee" whose report was 
&gt; the foundation for the Federal Privacy Act of 1974. President Ford 
&gt; appointed him to the Privacy Protection Study Commission whose report 
&gt; remains the most extensive examination of private sector record-keeping 
&gt; practices.  Dr. Ware is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, 
&gt; a Fellow of the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers, and a 
&gt; Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science.

&gt; the Grateful Dead, and a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier 
&gt; Foundation. He graduated from Wesleyan University with an honors degree 
&gt; in comparative religion. He writes and lectures on subjects relating to 
&gt; digital technology and society, and is a contributing editor of numerous 
&gt; publications, including Communications of the ACM, NeXTworld, 
&gt; MicroTimes, and Mondo 2000.
&gt; 
&gt; Cliff Stoll
&gt; 
&gt; Cliff Stoll is best known for tracking a computer intruder across the 
&gt; international networks in 1987; he told this story in his book, "The 
&gt; Cuckoo's Egg" and on a Nova television production. He is less known for 
&gt; having a PhD in planetary science, piecing quilts, making plum jam, and 
&gt; squeezing lumps of bituminous coal into diamonds.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; CFP'93 Tutorials:
&gt; 
&gt; Tuesday 9 March - Morning Tutorials
&gt; 
&gt; Information Use in the Private Sector
&gt; Jack Reed, Information Resource Service Company
&gt; Diane Terry, TransUnion Corp.    Dan Jones, D.Y. Jones &amp; Assoc.
&gt; 
&gt; This tutorial will deal with the use of personal information from the
&gt; point of view of some private sector information vendors and users. It
&gt; will include a discussion of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the
&gt; "Permissible Purposes" for obtaining a consumer credit report.
&gt; Information used for purposes outside the FCRA will be discussed in
&gt; relationship to privacy and societal needs for businesses and
&gt; individuals.
&gt; 
&gt; Access to Government Information:
&gt; James Love, Director, Taxpayer Assets Project
&gt; 
&gt; The tutorial will examine a wide range of problems concerning citizen 
&gt; access to government information, including how to ask for and receive 
&gt; information under the federal Freedom of Information Act, what types of 
&gt; information government agencies store on computers, what the barriers 
&gt; are to citizen access to these information resources, and how citizens 
&gt; can change government information policy to expand access to taxpayer-
&gt; funded information resources.
&gt; 
&gt; Exploring the Internet -- a guided journey
&gt; Mark Graham, Pandora Systems	Tim Pozar, Late Night Software
&gt; 
&gt; This tutorial will give participants a practical introduction to the 
&gt; most popular and powerful applications available via the world's largest 
&gt; computer network, the Internet.  There will be hands-on demonstrations 
&gt; of communications tools such as e-mail, conferencing, Internet Relay 
&gt; Chat, and resource discovery and navigation aids such as Gopher, WAIS, 
&gt; Archie and World Wide Web. Extensive documentation will be provided.
&gt; 
&gt; Constitutional Law for Non-lawyers (1/2 session):
&gt; Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation
&gt; 
&gt; This tutorial is designed to inform non-lawyers about the Constitutional 
&gt; issues that underlie computer-crime and computer civil-liberties cases.  
&gt; The tutorial focuses on the First and Fourth Amendments, but includes a 
&gt; discussion of the Fifth Amendment and its possible connection to the 
&gt; compelled disclosure of cryptographic keys. It also includes a 
&gt; discussion of the appropriateness of "original intent" as a method for 
&gt; applying the Constitution in the modern era.
&gt; 
&gt; Civil Liberties Implications of Computer Searches &amp; Seizures (1/2 ses.):
&gt; Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation
&gt; 
&gt; This tutorial assumes only a very basic knowledge of Constitutional law 
&gt; (the prior tutorial provides an adequate background), and outlines how 
&gt; searches and seizures of computers may raise issues of First and Fourth 
&gt; Amendment rights, as well as of federal statutory protections. It 
&gt; includes a discussion of what proper search-and-seizure techniques in 
&gt; such cases may be. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Tuesday 9 March - Afternoon Tutorials
&gt; 
&gt; Practical Data Inferencing: What we THINK we know about you.
&gt; Russell L. Brand, Senior Computer Scientist, Reasoning Systems
&gt; 
&gt; What do your transaction trails reveal about you?  Are you a good risk 
&gt; to insure?  Are you worth kidnapping, auditing or suing?  Which products 
&gt; should I target at you?  Are you a member of one of those groups that I 
&gt; would want to harass or discriminate against? This tutorial will be a 
&gt; hands-on approach to digging for data and to piecing it back together.  
&gt; Time will be divided between malicious personal invasions and sweeping 
&gt; searches that seek only profit, followed by a brief discussion about 
&gt; improper inferences and their practical impact on innocent files and 
&gt; lives. Legal and moral issues will not be addressed.
&gt; 
&gt; Telecommunications Fraud
&gt; Donald P. Delaney, Senior Investigator, New York State Police
&gt; 
&gt; Illegal call sell operations in New York City are estimated to be a 
&gt; billion dollar industry. This tutorial will provide an overview of the 
&gt; problem, from finger hacking to pay phone enterprises, and will include 
&gt; an up-to-date assessment of the computer cracker/hacker/phone phreak 
&gt; impact on telephone company customer losses. Also discussed will be 
&gt; unlawful access of telephone company switches; unlawful wiretapping and 
&gt; monitoring; cards, codes and 950 numbers; New York State law and police 
&gt; enforcement; methods of investigation and case studies.
&gt; 
&gt; Private Sector Marketplace and Workplace Privacy 
&gt; Ernest A. Kallman, Bentley College, H. Jeff Smith, Georgetown University
&gt; 
&gt; This tutorial will give participants a general overview of privacy 
&gt; issues affecting uses of personal information (e.g., medical 
&gt; information, financial information, purchase histories) in the 
&gt; marketplace as well as privacy concerns in the workplace (e.g., privacy 
&gt; of electronic and voice mail, work monitoring).  The tutorial will also 
&gt; set the boundaries for privacy arguments in the middle and latter 1990s.
&gt; 
&gt; SysLaw
&gt; Lance Rose, Attorney and Author "SysLaw"
&gt; 
&gt; The SysLaw tutorial session will explore in depth the freedom and
&gt; privacy issues encountered by computer bulletin boards (BBS), their
&gt; system operators and their users.  BBSs are estimated to number over
&gt; 45,000 today (not counting corporate systems), and range from small,
&gt; spare-time hobby systems to systems with thousands of users, grossing
&gt; millions of dollars.  BBSs are a grassroots movement with an entry cost
&gt; of $1,000 or less, and the primary vehicles for new forms of electronic
&gt; communities and services. Subjects covered will include: First Amendment
&gt; protection for the BBS as publisher/distributor; data freedom and
&gt; property rights on the BBS; how far can sysops control BBS user
&gt; activities?; and user privacy on BBSs today.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: Tutorial presenters will offer expert opinions and information.
&gt; Some may advocate particular viewpoints and thus may put their own
&gt; "spin" on the issues. Caveat Listener. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; CFP'93 Main Program Sessions: 
&gt; 
&gt; Wednesday 10 March
&gt; 
&gt; Electronic Democracy
&gt; Chair - Jim Warren, MicroTimes and Autodesk, Inc.
&gt; 
&gt; The effects of computer and telecommunications technologies on 
&gt; democratic processes and institutions are increasing dramatically. This 
&gt; session will explore their impacts on political organizing, campaigning, 
&gt; access to representatives and agencies, and access to government 
&gt; information that is essential for a free press and an informed 
&gt; electorate.
&gt; 
&gt; Electronic Voting -- Threats to Democracy
&gt; Chair - Rebecca Mercuri, University of Pennsylvania
&gt; 
&gt; This panel session will invite representatives covering a broad spectrum 
&gt; of involvement with the controversial subject of electronic vote 
&gt; tallying to address such issues as: Is a secure and reliable electronic 
&gt; voting system feasible? What threats to these systems are identifiable? 
&gt; Should electronic voting systems be open for thorough examination? Can 
&gt; auditability be assured in an anonymous ballot setting? Can voting by 
&gt; phone be practical and confidential? Did Congress exempt voting machines 
&gt; from the Computer Security Act?
&gt; 
&gt; Censorship and Free Speech on the Networks
&gt; Chair - Barbara Simons, IBM
&gt; 
&gt; As online forums become increasingly pervasive, the notion of "community 
&gt; standards" becomes harder to pin down. Networks and BBSs will link--or 
&gt; create--diverse, non-geographic communities with differing standards, 
&gt; laws, customs and mores. What may be frank discussion in one forum may 
&gt; be obscenity or defamation or sexual harassment in another. This session 
&gt; will explore the questions of what kinds of freedom-of-speech problems 
&gt; face us on the Net and what kinds of legal and social solutions we need.
&gt; 
&gt; Portrait of the Artist on the Net
&gt; Chair - Anna Couey, Arts Wire
&gt; 
&gt; Computer forums and networks make possible both new artforms and new 
&gt; ways of remote collaboration and exhibition. The growth of the Net 
&gt; creates opportunities for the blossoming of dynamic and interactive 
&gt; artforms and of artistic cultures -- provided that networks become 
&gt; widely accessible and remain open to artistic expression without 
&gt; political interference. This session will examine the potentials and the 
&gt; problems of art and artists on the Net.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thursday 11 March
&gt; 
&gt; Digital Telephony and Crypto Policy
&gt; Chair - John Podesta, Podesta and Associates
&gt; 
&gt; The increasingly digital nature of telecommunications potentially 
&gt; threatens the ability of law enforcement agencies to intercept them when 
&gt; legally authorized to do so. In addition, the potential widespread use 
&gt; of cryptography may render the ability to intercept a communication 
&gt; moot. This session will examine these issues and the proposals that 
&gt; have been put before Congress by law enforcement agencies to address 
&gt; these perceived problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Health Records and Confidentiality
&gt; Chair - Janlori Goldman, American Civil Liberties Union
&gt; 
&gt; As the new Administration and Congress consider proposals to reform the 
&gt; United States health care system, it is imperative that confidentiality 
&gt; and security safeguards be put in place to protect personal information. 
&gt; Currently, no comprehensive legislation exists on the confidentiality of 
&gt; health information. This session will explore the current and potential 
&gt; uses of health care information, and proposals to safeguard the 
&gt; information.
&gt; 
&gt; The Many Faces of Privacy
&gt; Chair  - Willis Ware, Rand Corp.
&gt; 
&gt; Privacy at any cost is foolish, unwise and an untenable position, and 
&gt; privacy at zero cost is a myth. This two-part session will explore the 
&gt; balancing act between the two extremes and the costs and benefits that 
&gt; accrue. The first part will present several examples of systems and 
&gt; applications in the public and private sectors that stake out a position 
&gt; in this continuum.   The second part will be a panel discussion 
&gt; exploring the issues raised by the examples previously presented.
&gt; 
&gt; The Digital Individual
&gt; Chair - Max Nelson-Kilger, San Jose State University
&gt; 
&gt; We are all represented by personal records in countless databases. As 
&gt; these records are accumulated, disseminated and coalesced, each of us is 
&gt; shadowed by an ever larger and more detailed data alter-ego, which 
&gt; increasingly stands in for us in many situations without our permission 
&gt; or even awareness. How does this happen? How does it affect us? How will 
&gt; it develop in the future? What can we do? This session will investigate 
&gt; these questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Friday 12 March
&gt; 
&gt; Gender Issues in Computing and Telecommunications
&gt; Chair - Judi Clark, Bay Area Women in Telecommunications
&gt; 
&gt; Online environments are largely determined by the viewpoints of their
&gt; users and programmers, still predominantly white men. This panel will
&gt; discuss issues of freedom and privacy that tend to affect women -- such
&gt; as access, identity, harassment, pornography and online behavior -- and
&gt; provide recommendations for gender equity policies to bulletin board
&gt; operators and system administrators.
&gt; 
&gt; The Hand That Wields the Gavel
&gt; Chair - Don Ingraham, Asst. District Attorney, Alameda County, CA
&gt; 
&gt; An inevitable result of the settlement of Cyberspace is the adaptation
&gt; of the law to its particular effects. In this session  a panel of
&gt; criminal lawyers addresses the fallout from a hypothetical computer
&gt; virus on the legal responsibilities of system managers and operators.
&gt; The format will be a simulated court hearing. Attendees will act as
&gt; advisory jurors in questioning and in rendering a verdict.
&gt; 
&gt; The Power, Politics, and Promise of Internetworking
&gt; Chair- Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation
&gt; 
&gt; This session will explore the development of internetworking 
&gt; infrastructures, domestically and worldwide. How will this 
&gt; infrastructure and its applications be used by the general public?  What 
&gt; will the global network look like to the average user from Kansas to 
&gt; Kiev?  How will politics, technology and legislation influence the 
&gt; access to, and cost of, the Net?  How can the potential of this powerful 
&gt; medium be fully realized?
&gt; 
&gt; International Data Flow
&gt; Chair - George Trubow, John Marshall Law School
&gt; 
&gt; The trans-border flow of information on international computer networks 
&gt; has been a concern for governments and the private sector. In addition 
&gt; to concerns for privacy and data security, the economic and national 
&gt; security implications of this free flow of information among scientists, 
&gt; engineers and researchers around the world are also cause for concern. 
&gt; This session will assemble a number of speakers to compare the various 
&gt; perspectives on the problem
