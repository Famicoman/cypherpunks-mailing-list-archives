&gt; The longterm solution is to use "positive reputations" and not just
&gt; "negative reputations" (as in Kill files). This is something Dean
&gt; Tribble just talked about at our last physical meeting of the
&gt; Cypherpunks ("Bay Area Branch" :-} ).
&gt; 

&gt; Think of like a credit rating. People _earn_ trust, they don't just
&gt; get assigned a credit rating until they do something bad. 


&gt;From: pmetzger@shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger)
&gt;Indeed, in the long run, when there are billions of people in the  
&gt;nets, even UseNet newsgroups devoted to people who use musical  
&gt;instruments as sex toys would have thousands of posts a day because  
&gt;given billions of possible subscribers, finding a few tens of  
&gt;thousands with a particularly obscure interest wouldn't be hard.  
&gt;Thus, in the long run, the nets will move to "closed" newsgroups and  
&gt;mailing lists in which to be a subscriber one will have to be  
&gt;explicitly subscribed to a list and will only be able to read with  
&gt;one's private key and post by digitally signing messages. In such
&gt;an environment, anonymous abusers will simply be incapable of  
&gt;annoying people.

Yes, but there will still need to be a way for new people to join the  
lists, (and the net in general) before they've had a chance to "prove  
themselves."  Allowing all new id's to post to the whole group on a  
probationary basis is unacceptable;  as soon as someone proves  
obnoxious enough to kick off they could just start over with a new  
id.  The obvious answer is that a moderator will be necessary for all  
closed lists that require a positive rep for posting and that don't  
wish to be forever limited to their founding members.  After a few  
lucid posts passed by the moderator, an individual would gain enough  
of a reputation not to be filtered out any longer.

Of course, anyone who's heard Howard Stern fans invade political  
call-in shows will realize there's not much that can be done with  
those weird people who will spend a lot of time and energy to appear  
credible, only to annoy people.
