For you all.  Interesting because it would appear to be a real live
marketplace, with real live money, tho no crypto per se in there.

  Greetings,

  this is an  item from corryfee. Apologies to those who have
  already seen it. I thought it was sufficiently interesting
  to pass it on. 

  BTW, the some of the results of the Santa Fe experiment, to which
  the text refers, will be published in a forthcomming book by 
  John Rust and Dan Friedman "Double Auction Markets: Theory, Institutions,
  Evidence". Publisher is Addison-Wesley (Santa Fe Institute series
  On Studies in the Science of Complexity).

  Cheers,

&gt;                             ANNOUNCING THE OPENING OF THE
&gt;  
&gt;                             ARIZONA TOKEN EXCHANGE (AZTE)
&gt;  
&gt;                                   January 1, 1993
&gt;  
&gt; Earn cash profits by competing against computerized program traders
&gt;  
&gt; THE CHALLENGE
&gt;  
&gt; Is "artificial intelligence" superior to human intelligence? In
&gt; some domains such as chess, computer programs now outperform all
&gt; but the very best human players.  However in other domains such as
&gt; speech, handwriting, and other kinds of pattern recognition,
&gt; computers lag far behind human beings.  On Wall Street computer
&gt; "program traders" are becoming increasingly common, yet there is
&gt; substantial controversy over their performance -- they have even
&gt; been blamed as a factor in the October 1987 stock market crash.
&gt; The purpose of this study, co-sponsored by the University of
&gt; Arizona's Economic Science Laboratory and the Santa Fe Institute,
&gt; is to compare the performance of human and program traders to see
&gt; whether humans can learn to exploit the limitations  and
&gt; idiosyncracies of computers in repeated interactions.
&gt;  
&gt; THE ARIZONA TOKEN EXCHANGE
&gt;  
&gt; To compare the performance of human and program traders we have
&gt; created a computerized market, the Arizona Token Exchange (AZTE),
&gt; in which a fictional commodity, "tokens", are traded.  The market
&gt; is a simplified version of commodity exchanges such as the Chicago
&gt; Board of Trade where buyers and sellers are able to call out bids
&gt; and asks to buy or sell units of the commodity.  In each trading
&gt; session on AZTE traders are assigned the role of buyer or seller
&gt; and are given an allocation of tokens.  A seller's objective is to
&gt; sell their tokens for as much as possible above the token cost and
&gt; a buyer's objective is to buy tokens as cheaply as possible below
&gt; their redemption value.
&gt;  
&gt; By ranking the token costs and redemption values, well-defined
&gt; supply and demand curves can be constructed.  The intersection of
&gt; these curves defines the so-called competitive equilibrium (CE)
&gt; price and quantity, at which neoclassical economic theory predicts
&gt; all trading will occur.   The complication is that in the AZTE,
&gt; each trader's token costs and redemption values are private
&gt; information and differ from trader to trader.  Thus traders in the
&gt; AZTE face a complex sequential decision problem: how much should
&gt; they bid or ask for their own tokens, how soon should they place a
&gt; bid or ask, and under what circumstances should they accept an
&gt; outstanding bid or ask of some other trader? An additional
&gt; complication is that each trading session runs for a fixed amount
&gt; of time.  This creates a difficult trade-off, for if traders spend
&gt; too much time looking for a good deal, they may find themselves
&gt; locked out of the market without trading anything.
&gt;  
&gt; HOW IS TRADER PERFORMANCE EVALUATED?
&gt;  
&gt; In the AZTE there is a well-defined performance measure: trading
&gt; efficiency, EFF.  This is the ratio of profits a trader actually
&gt; earns divided by the profits it would have made if all trades took
&gt; place at the competitive equilibrium level.  Thus, if a trader's
&gt; EFF is greater than 100% they are earning more than their "fair"
&gt; share of the profits.  The use of EFF is more desirable
&gt; performance measure than simply using trading profits, since
&gt; profits depend on the token allocations which are allocated at
&gt; random from a known distribution.
&gt;  
&gt; After each trading session, participants will earn cash profits
&gt; equal to the following linear function of their efficiency:
&gt;  
&gt;      $ payments =  a + b(EFF-100)
&gt;  
&gt; The term a represents a fixed fee paid for participating in the
&gt; trading session and the term b(EFF-100) represents a bonus
&gt; (penalty) for trading above (or below) 100% efficiency.  Thus, it
&gt; is possible to lose money in any particular trading session.
&gt; Dollar earnings are cumulated over successive trading sessions and
&gt; subjects are eligible to "cash out" at any time after participating
&gt; in a minimum number of trading sessions (provided cumulative
&gt; earnings are positive).
&gt;  
&gt; THE OPPONENTS: COMPUTER PROGRAM TRADERS
&gt;  
&gt; Unlike real commodities markets where most traders are humans, in
&gt; the AZTE all of your opponents will be computer programs.  The
&gt; opponent programs will be selected from a field of over 30
&gt; different trading strategies including winners of the Santa Fe
&gt; Institute's Double Auction Tournament held in March, 1990.  The
&gt; program traders range in sophistication from simple rules of thumb
&gt; (such as Gode-Sunder "Zero-Intelligence" strategy) to sophisticated
&gt; optimizing/learning algorithms (such as neural nets and genetic
&gt; algorithms) developed from the recent literature on artificial
&gt; intelligence.  The identities of your opponents will (usually) be
&gt; revealed to you at the start of each trading session.  You will
&gt; also be informed about other market characteristics such as the
&gt; number of buyers and sellers, the number of tokens, and the joint
&gt; distribution from which token values are drawn.
&gt;  
&gt; SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT
&gt;  
&gt; To trade on the AZTE you will need a Unix or PC-compatible computer
&gt; linked to the Internet computer network.  We provide the trading
&gt; interface software that allows you to log on and trade at any time
&gt; you like and for as long as you like (subject to general
&gt; restrictions).  To qualify for an AZTE trading account you need to
&gt; file an application providing information on your address, phone,
&gt; and email address, and a release form stating whether or not you
&gt; want to remain anonymous in published analyses of the outcome of
&gt; this experiment.  Upon receipt of the application we will set up a
&gt; trading account and access password.  Your dollar earnings will
&gt; cumulate in your account until you decide to cash out, at which
&gt; time we will close your account and mail you a check for the total
&gt; amount of your earnings.
&gt;  
&gt; The software and ASCII traders' manual (including the application
&gt; form) is available via anonymous ftp on "fido.econ.arizona.edu", in
&gt; the azte sub-directory.  The manual (azte.man) explains how the
&gt; software works and what is required to use it.  We suggest you ftp
&gt; this first and read through it, then get the appropriate trading
&gt; interface for your system.  The DOS interface requires VGA graphics
&gt; resolution and the use of Clarkson packet drivers for the network
&gt; interface card.  The Clarkson drivers are also available via ftp on
&gt; "fido.econ.arizona.edu".
&gt;  
&gt; If you don't have access to anonymous ftp, we will mail you a
&gt; diskette containing the software and trader's manual.  To cover the
&gt; costs of a diskette and surface mail, send $5.00 to:

&gt; We will assist in ftp and setting up the Clarkson packet drivers,
&gt; just give us a call.
