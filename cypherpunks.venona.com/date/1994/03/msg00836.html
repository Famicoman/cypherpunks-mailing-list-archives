&gt; Today's news.
&gt; 
&gt;          WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The FBI warned Friday that wiretaps
&gt; might soon become impossible unless Congress updates a law
&gt; requiring telephone companies to cooperate with law enforcement
&gt; agencies on electronic surveillance.
&gt;          ``Unless Congress creates a new law, law enforcement's
&gt; ability to protect the public against crime will be gravely
&gt; eroded and the national security will be placed at risk,'' FBI
&gt; Director Louis Freeh told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
&gt;          Freeh said new technology such as cellular telephones, call
&gt; forwarding and digital switching was making it more difficult
&gt; for the FBI and other agencies to operate wiretaps, which he
&gt; called one of law enforcement's best tools against crime and
&gt; terrorism.
&gt;          ``We could be out of the wiretap business in a very short
&gt; time,'' Freeh said. He said 91 court-approved wiretaps were
&gt; abandoned last year because telephone companies could not solve
&gt; technical problems.
&gt;          ``They (telephone companies) have told us they will not be
&gt; able to provide the access we need. We have certain requirements
&gt; which they tell us are not going into the software,'' he said.
&gt;          Freeh said he wanted the 1968 law rewritten to require all
&gt; telephone companies to meet technical requirements for wiretaps
&gt; of new equipment. He said it would cost less than $1 billion and
&gt; would be paid in part by the federal government.
&gt;          He said wiretaps had helped prevent several terrorist
&gt; attacks in the United States in recent years, including a 1986
&gt; plot to shoot down an airliner, and helped convict over 22,000
&gt; felons in the past decade.
&gt;          Freeh said a new law would not jeopardize privacy, but
&gt; Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said he was still
&gt; concerned: ``My hope is that we can serve legitimate law
&gt; enforcement needs without jeopardizing privacy rights or
&gt; frustrating innovation and development of new technologies or
&gt; undercutting the competitiveness of America's high tech
&gt; industries.''
&gt;          The U.S. Telephone Association, which represents more than
&gt; 1,100 local telephone companies including the regional Bell
&gt; companies, said it believed the current law was adequate. It
&gt; said its members were cooperating with law enforcement.
&gt;          Freeh said he had been meeting with representatives of the
&gt; telephone industry but had been unable to get a voluntary
&gt; agreement that would cover all companies.
