 Introduction

 Modern block ciphers seek to emulate extremely large substitution
 tables algorithmically, using complex combinations of various simple
 internal mechanisms.  These internal mechanisms include small
 substitutions and trivial combinings, but the art and mystery
 of block cipher design is how to couple these simple and weak
 operations in ways which produce a strong overall cipher.

 One apparently new type of mechanism which might be useful in block
 cipher design would take two blocks in, share data between them,
 and then produce two generally-different blocks as a result.  In
 particular, this mechanism might be used to mix data to (and from)
 a pair of substitutions, thus hopefully producing a stronger result
 than the two substitutions operating separately and independently.
 In most cases, it would be necessary for the mechanism to have an
 inverse, and to produce output blocks of the same size as the input.
 The result would be a mechanism which could be inserted anywhere
 in the internal data paths common in block-cipher designs.


 Block Mixing Transforms

 Consider constructs like this:

             A              B
             |              |
             v              v
             Mixing Transform
             |              |
             v              v
             X              Y

             X              Y
             |              |
             v              v
             Inverse Transform
             |              |
             v              v
             A              B

 Capital letters represent data blocks.  Alternately, we can
 describe the transform, in general, as:

      X := f1( A, B );   Y := f2( A, B );

      A := f3( X, Y );   B := f4( X, Y );

 The intent of such a system is to mix two input blocks in a complex
 yet reversible way.  This could provide two advantages:

      1) It should make each output bit a function of all the input
      bits (on average), thus providing a way to expand block size
      while using smaller block-cipher functions.  Hopefully the
      construct would also defeat attempts to "divide-and-conquer"
      the smaller functions separately.

      2) It could provide a way to connect block-cipher functions
      in sequence, while eliminating any fixed direct connection
      between the blocks, such connections being vulnerable to
      "fix-in-the-middle" attack.

 A mixing transform is not unlike a "butterfly" section in a fast
 Fourier transform (FFT) [3].  But the usual FFT operates on complex
 values which are normally represented in floating-point.  When
 implemented in fixed-point (as needed for mixing data blocks), the
 normal FFT butterfly expands the range of the input values, thus
 requiring a larger amount of storage (a larger block size) for the
 result.  Fast Hadamard / Walsh transforms [2] behave similarly.

 For cryptography, we need transforms which are "size preserving"
 so that we can perform fixed-size block operations (such as DES)
 either on the input data or on the transformed results.  It was
 not clear to me that this was going to be possible (at least with
 equations of practical complexity) until Eli Biham provided some
 examples of size-preserving mixing transforms:

      X := A - B;   Y := 2A - B;

      A := Y - X;   B := Y - 2X;

 for n-bit blocks, A, B, X, and Y, and arithmetic mod 2^n.

 There are actually many such transforms, and Biham has found a
 generalized form:

      (-1  1  )
      (-w  w-1)

 and

      (w-1  -1)
      (w    -1)

 where w is some constant.  For example, when w = 2:

      X := -1*A +     1*B  =  B -  A
      Y := -2*A + (2-1)*B  =  B - 2A

      A := (2-1)*X + -1*Y  =   X - Y
      B :=     2*X + -1*Y  =  2X - Y

 with the arithmetic mod 2^n.

 To see inverse, note that

      A  =   X - Y  =   (B - A) - (B - 2A)  =  A
      B  =  2X - Y  =  2(B - A) - (B - 2A)  =  B

 These are fixed, linear transformations.  If we know the input
 values, and the transformation, we will also know the output
 values.  Even when the full equation is unknown, the simplicity
 and linearity of these transforms means that they require
 special protection in cryptographic applications.  Mixing
 transforms can only be used when both the input and the output
 values cannot be exposed simultaneously.

 Alas, the transform mentioned above has a problem:  Specifically,
 the least-significant-bit (lsb); that is, lsb(Y) = lsb(B).  This
 is because the expression B - 2A has shifted A left one bit,
 leaving the bottom bit of B exposed.  This provides a bit of direct
 correlation between an input value and an output value.  This is
 probably sufficient to support a practical "fix-in-the-middle"
 attack if the transform is used to isolate two DES operations.

 Consider these correlation experiments on the above transform with
 4-bit blocks:

           x3  x2  x1  x0  y3  y2  y1  y0

      b0   64  64  64  64  64  64  64 128
      b1   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
      b2   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
      b3   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
      a0   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
      a1   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
      a2   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
      a3   64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64

 This is a 0 -&gt; 0 correlation count.  For each possible input value
 (over both A and B), for each input bit which is zero (somewhere in
 A and B) and each output bit which is zero (somewhere in X and Y),
 a count is recorded.  The count of 128 means that y0, the lsb of Y,
 occurs twice as often as expected when the lsb of B is zero.

 Similarly,

           64  64  64  64  64  64  64   0
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64

 a 0 -&gt; 1 correlation count, shows that no cases exist where the
 lsb of B is a one and the lsb of Y is a zero.


 Cryptographic Mixing

 In [8] I introduced a new type of reversible stream-cipher combiner
 (the first stream-cipher combiner, which we now call "exclusive-OR"
 or "mod-2 addition" was described by Vernam [12]).  "Combiner" is
 the traditional cryptographic name for a mixing function.  [11,5,1]
 (Non-reversible combiners are also used, typically to make confusion
 sequences difficult to penetrate. [e.g., 6])  Combiners and mixing
 transforms have much in common.

 Basically, a combiner will look like any other two-input one-output
 function:

             A             B
             |             |
             v             v
             Mixing Function
             |
             v
             C

             C              B
             |              |
             v              v
             Inverse Function
             |
             v
             A

 The capital letters represent the block size; in a typical stream
 cipher these are byte values.  A is the plaintext, B the confusion
 stream, C the ciphertext.  Note that exactly the same confusion
 stream is needed to recover the original data; this is the heart
 of stream-cipher security.

 There are many two-input functions, but most are not useful as
 cryptographic data combiners, which must be reversible and must
 have no correlation between either input and the output.  Combiners
 which do have correlation [e.g., 4] fall to statistical attacks
 [e.g., 10].  If we see mixing transforms as a matched-set of
 cryptographic combiners, we can see that correlation is a problem
 with the example transform.  (Biham did have an example of one
 balanced but non-keyed transform based on rotation and subtraction
 mod 2^n.)


 Mixing in Mod-2 Polynomials

 Since the "weak" exclusive-OR form of combiner has long been
 available, modern combiner designs are normally intended to be
 "stronger" and, thus, are more complex.  But it is not at all clear
 that "stronger" is what we need in a mixing transform.  Presumably,
 "strength" can be provided more efficiently by some other function,
 like DES, or a substitution table.  Thus, we may really want a
 modest-strength extremely-fast mixing solution, and one approach
 is to consider the well-known field of mod-2 polynomials.

 In mod-2 arithmetic, addition is the same as subtraction

      X + Y  =  X - Y

 and any value added to itself is zero

      X + X = 0

 so, in general, multiplication cannot be achieved by addition

      X + X &lt;&gt; 2X

 (assuming X is non-zero) but is instead achieved by shifting.
 Then

      2X + X = 3X

 so multiplication is not restricted to binary powers.  Of course

      3X + X = 2X

 which just shows that mod-2 arithmetic can be surprising.

 It is interesting to see just how unusual good mixing transforms
 are.  Consider a first approach

      X := A + B;  Y := A - B;

 (mod-2, mod-p, where p is some primitive mod-2 polynomial of
 appropriate degree for the size of the data blocks).  While this
 is a reasonable approach in the integers, in mod-2 polys,
 A + B = A - B.  This means that  X = Y, and the two resulting
 identical blocks cannot possibly carry enough information to
 provide an inverse transform for two arbitrary input blocks.
 It does not work.

 Next consider

      X := A + B;  Y := A + 2B;

 with inverse operations

      A := (2X + Y) / 3;   B := (X + Y) / 3;

 (mod-2, mod-p), and the division done by multiplying by the inverse
 of 3, mod p.  (Appropriate inverse equations may not always exist;
 finding the inverse equations is interesting in itself.)  This
 works.  But here  X  is never affected by p at all, thus producing
 an extremely regular (and un-keyed) transformation.  And the
 inverse multiplication is, in general, far more expensive than
 multiplication by a small integer.

 Finally, consider

      X := 2A + 3B;   Y := 3A + 2B;

      A := 2X + 3Y;   B := 3X + 2Y;

 Again, operations are mod-2 and mod-p, where p is some primitive
 mod-2 polynomial of appropriate degree for the data blocks X, Y,
 A and B.  This works, and the transform is a self-inverse.  The
 primitive affects the result in both data blocks.  And the
 multiplications are simple.

 Correlation experiments conducted as before show a nice, balanced,
 uncorrelated system:

           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64

           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64
           64  64  64  64  64  64  64  64

 These functions are extremely fast.  Addition is a simple
 exclusive-OR.  Multiplication by two is simply a left-shift and
 a conditional add of the primitive.  Multiplication by three is
 a multiplication by two plus an addition.


 Keyed Mixing Transforms

 The mod-2 polynomial transforms depend on having some primitive of
 the appropriate degree.  Different primitives produce different
 mixing functions, with similar overall performance.  This leads
 to the possibility of keying the transforms by selecting arbitrary
 primitives.  (Some references to primitive-finding algorithms
 are given in [9].)

 Rabin gives the number of degree-n primitives as about p^n / n
 [7].  Thus, for degree 64, we have about 2^64 / 2^6 or about 2^58
 primitives.  This means that each randomly-selected degree-64
 primitive carries about 58 bits of key.  Of course, this key can
 only be effective to the extent that the linear transformation
 cannot be attacked and the primitive thus deduced.


 Some Consequences

 If a single input bit changes on one of the mixing transform input
 blocks, we can be sure that at least one bit will change in both
 output blocks.

 If two input bits change, we can be sure that these bits will not
 "cancel" each other; changes will still occur in the output blocks.

 If many input bits are changed, and the transform primitive is
 known, it is possible to engineer a no-change in one output block
 (although this is unlikely to happen by chance).  Should this be
 undesirable, it might be made impossible by design (such as
 ciphering the input blocks before mixing), or by keying the
 transform (so the necessary bit patterns are unknown).

 If it becomes possible to define the input to, and what the output
 must be from a ciphering element, it will be possible to key-search
 that element independent of other elements, and this is what we
 hope to avoid.  To prevent this it may be necessary to use keyed
 input and output transforms, or even multiple ciphering levels
 between transforms.


 Applications

 It is crucial to remember that these simple, high-speed, but linear
 mixing transforms can be said to have "strength" only if the input
 and output values are never both available.  That is, these
 structures do not by themselves handle "known-plaintext" attack.
 (Of course, the same could be said for many other simple internal
 mechanisms used in block cipher construction.)

 Simple constructs like

           A      B
           |      |
           v      v
           MixTrans
           |      |
           v      v
           C      D

 are not likely to be very useful as ciphers by themselves, even if
 the mixing transformation is keyed and the blocks are large.

 On the other hand, constructs like

           A      B
           |  p1  |
           v  v   v
           MixTrans
           |      |
           v      v
          DES1   DES2
           |      |
           |  p2  |
           v  v   v
           MixTrans
           |      |
           v      v
           C      D

 are considerably more interesting.  Note that this construct
 ciphers a double-size DES block at single-DES rates.  It seems to
 require keyed mixing transforms.  Similarly,

           A      B
           |      |
           v      v
          DES1   DES2
           |      |
           |  p   |
           v  v   v
           MixTrans
           |      |
           v      v
          DES3   DES4
           |      |
           v      v
           C      D

 will cipher a double-size DES block at double-DES rates, and at
 least superficially avoids all weakness in the mixing transform by
 placing strength in each input and output port.  This may avoid
 the need to key the mixing transform.

 Alternately,

             A              B
             |      k1      |
             v      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES1-----|

             |      k2      |
             |      v       v
             |---- DES2 -&gt; XOR
             |              |
             |      p       |
             v      v       v
             Mixing Transform
             |              |
             |      k3      |
             v      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES3 ----|
             |              |
             |      k4      |
             |      v       v
             |---- DES4 -&gt; XOR
             |              |
             v              v
             C              D

 also ciphers at double-DES rates.

 Of course, larger external blocks mean an increase in the number
 of internal data paths, making various sorts of interconnection
 configurations possible.  Thus

           A      B      C      D

 These are new ciphering architectures.  Clearly, it is not known
 how strong these constructs would be.  However, this situation can
 hardly be considered unusual.

 Other opportunities exist when constructing completely new block
 ciphers.  These might, for example, be based on byte-wide key-
 permuted substitutions, thus avoiding differential attacks on
 fixed "optimal" tables.  Thus

    ------------------------------mix------------------------------
    --------------mix-------------- --------------mix--------------
    ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------
    --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix--
    mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix
    S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
    mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix
    --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix--
    ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------
    --------------mix-------------- --------------mix--------------
    ------------------------------mix------------------------------

 enciphers 256-bit blocks through 32 keyed 8-bit substitutions by
 using five levels of input keyed mixing transform and five levels
 of output keyed mixing transforms of varying size.  Clearly, there
 are a plethora of alternate interconnection possibilities here.
 For example, the mixing rows could be permuted, different sizes
 of mixing combined in some rows, the mixing not arranged on 2^n
 boundaries, etc., etc.  Since the mixing transforms are extremely
 fast, we would expect this 256-bit system to be much faster than
 64-bit single-DES.

 And,

    S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
    mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix
    --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix--
    ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------
    --------------mix-------------- --------------mix--------------
    ------------------------------mix------------------------------

    ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------ ------mix------
    --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix-- --mix--
    mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix
    S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S

 enciphers 256-bit blocks through 64 keyed 8-bit substitutions by
 using nine levels of mixing transforms of varying size.  With the
 substitutions all keyed, we can probably avoid keying the mixing
 transforms.  Again, there are a plethora of alternate
 interconnection possibilities.


 Summary

 Practical, high-speed, keyed, balanced, and size-preserving block
 mixing transforms are introduced for cryptographic service.
