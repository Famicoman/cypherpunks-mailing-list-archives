Get real!  Lirpa Sloof spelled backwards is April Fools.  You're right, 
it's not a sick joke, it's an April Fools joke.

&gt;
&gt; Trust Congress? Not With This Unbelieveable Lair of Slop
&gt; PC Computing, April 1994, page 88.
&gt; By John C. Dvorak
&gt;
&gt;  When Vice President Gore began talking about the Information Highway, we
&gt; all knew the bureaucrats would get involved more than we might like. In
&gt; fact, it may already be too late to stop a horrible Senate bill from
&gt; becoming law.
&gt;
&gt;  The moniker -- Information Highway -- itself seems to be responsible for SB
&gt; #040194. Introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy, it's designed to prohibit
&gt; anyone from using a public computer network (Information Highway) while the
&gt; computer user is intoxicated. I know how silly this sounds, but Congress
&gt; apparently thinks that being drunk on a highway is bad no matter what kind
&gt; of highway it is. The bill is expected to pass this month.
&gt;
&gt;  There already are rampant arguments as to how this proposed law can
&gt; possibly be enforced. The FBI hopes to use it as an excuse to do routine
&gt; wiretaps on any computer if there is any evidence that the owner "uses or
&gt; abuses alcohol and has access to a modem." Note how it slips in the word
&gt; 'uses'. This means if you've been seen drinking one lone beer, you can have
&gt; your line tapped.
&gt;
&gt;  Because this law would be so difficult to enforce, police officials are
&gt; drooling over the prospect of easily obtaining permits to do wiretaps. Ask
&gt; enforcement officials in Washington and they'll tell you the proposed law is
&gt; idiotic, but none will oppose it. Check the classified ads in the
&gt; "Washington Post" and you'll find the FBI, National Security Agency, and
&gt; something called the Online Enforcement Agency (when did they set that up?)
&gt; all soliciting experts in phone technology, specifically wiretapping.
&gt;
&gt;  It gets worse. The Congressional Record of February 19, 1994, has a report
&gt; that outlines the use of computerized BBSes, Internet, Inter-Relay Chat, and
&gt; CompuServe CB as "propagating illicit sexual  encounters and meetings
&gt; between couples -- any of whom are underage... Even people purporting to
&gt; routinely have sex with animals are present on these systems to foster their
&gt; odd beliefs on the public-at-large." A rider on SB #040194 makes it a felony
&gt; to discuss sexual matters on any public-access network, including the
&gt; Internet, America Online, and CompuServe.
&gt;
&gt;  I wondered how private companies such as America Online can be considered
&gt; public-access networks, so I called Senator Barbara Boxer's office and
&gt; talked to an aide, a woman named Felicia. She said the use of promotional
&gt; cards that give away a free hour or two of service constitues public access.
&gt; You know, like the ones found in the back of books or in modem boxes. She
&gt; also told me most BBS systems fall under this proposed statute. When asked
&gt; how they propose to enforce this law, she said it's not Congress's problem.
&gt; "Enforcement works itself out over time," she said.
&gt;
&gt;  The group fighting this moronic law is led by Jerome Bernstein of the
&gt; Washington law firm of Bernstein, Bernstein and Knowles (the firm that
&gt; first took Ollie North as a client). I couldn't get in touch with any
&gt; of the co-sponsors of the bill (including Senator Ted Kennedy, if you
&gt; can believe it!), but Bernstein was glad to talk. "These people have no
&gt; clue about the Information Highway or what it does. The whole thing got
&gt; started last Christmas during an antidrinking campaign in the Washington
&gt; D.C., metro area," Bernstein said, "I'm convinced someone jokingly told
&gt; Leahy's office about drunk driving on the Information High and the idea
&gt; snowballed. These senators actually think there is a physical highway.
&gt; Seriously, Senator Pat Moynihan asked me if you needed a driving permit
&gt; to 'drive' a modem on the Information Highway! He has no clue what a
&gt; modem is, and neither does the rest of Congress."
&gt;
&gt;  According to Bernstein, the antisexual wording in the bill was attributed
&gt; to Kennedy's office. "Kennedy thought that technology was leaving him
&gt; behind, and he wanted to be perceived as more up-to-date technologically.
&gt; He also though this would make amends for his alleged philandering."
&gt;
&gt;  Unfortunately, the public is not much better informed than the Senate.
&gt; The Gallup Organization, at the behest of Congress, is polling the
&gt; public regarding intoxication while using a computer and online "hot
&gt; chatting." The results are chilling. More than half of the public thinks
&gt; that using a computer while intoxicated should be illegal! The results
&gt; of the sexuality poll are not available. But one question, "Should a
&gt; teenage boy be encouraged to pretend he is a girl while chatting with
&gt; another person online?" has civil rights activists alarmed. According
&gt; to Kevin Avril of the ACLU, "This activity doesn't even qualify as
&gt; virtual cross-dressing. Who cares about this stuff? What are we going
&gt; to do? Legislate an anti-boys-will-be-boys law? It sets a bad
&gt; precedent."
&gt;
&gt;  I could go on and on with quotes and complaints from people regarding
&gt; this bill. But most of the complaints are getting nowhere. Pressure
&gt; groups, such as one led by Baptist ministers from De Kalb County,
&gt; Georgia, are supporting the law with such vehemence that they've managed
&gt; to derail an effort by modem manufacturers (the biggest being
&gt; Georgia-based Hayes) to lobby against the law. "Who wants to come out
&gt; and support drunkenness and computer sex?" asked a congressman who
&gt; requested anonymity.
&gt;
&gt;  So, except for Bernstein, Bernstein, and Knowles, and a few members of
&gt; the ACLU, there is nothing to stop this bill from becoming law. You can
&gt; register your protests with your congressperson or Ms. Lirpa Sloof in
&gt; the Senate Legislative Analysts Office. Her name spelled backward says
&gt; it all.
