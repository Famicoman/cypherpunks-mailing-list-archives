 &gt; As for Nathan Loofbourrow's charge that this must mean I am lazy
 &gt; and/or software-challenged, I suggest he try writing more posts for
 &gt; this list and/or writing code. 

I'll address the last first: I meant to imply neither. I don't think
encrypting traffic from cypherpunks tomorrow would have the desired
effect. However, I'll gladly work towards the day when such a change
can be transparent to its readers.

 &gt; I connect to the Net from my home Mac IIci or PowerBook 170 over a
 &gt; 14.4 modem line to Netcom, an Internet service provider many of you
 &gt; are familiar with. Once on Netcome, I have access to a wide range of
 &gt; standard UNIX tools. However, I do NOT run PGP on these machines!

 &gt; Rather, I run MacPGP (or PGP on my DOS machines, in emergencies, or
 &gt; even "MailSafe" in rare circumstances) on my *home* machine, after first
 &gt; downloading the mail with "Eudora 2.0," a nice off-line mail reader.
 &gt; It still takes several steps, as most of you can imagine. 

 &gt; I don't plan to start using PGP on insecure machines, even with a
 &gt; shortened "UNIX-grade" key. Especially not for a mailing list, where
 &gt; encryption is pointless (except to increase encrypted traffic a
 &gt; bit).

I would like to see greater independence from the list. With the help
of anonymous mailing and forwarding services, and with the use of a
secure machine, I may be able to read and respond to the list without
ever betraying my participation. Why announce to the world that I read
cypherpunks if I don't have to?

 &gt; Downloading and then decrypting 100 or more messages a day is not a
 &gt; viable option, and such a move would cause me to unsubscribe from the
 &gt; list rather quickly. (To clarify this: I read the list with "elm,"
 &gt; when I am on Netcom doing other things as well, like reading NetNews,
 &gt; and am thus able to delete about half of all messages before
 &gt; eventually--every few days, typically--dowloading the whole batch.
 &gt; Encrypted traffic would make this screening and immediate response
 &gt; much more difficult.)

Your particular connectivity and the ease of reading mail on-line seem
to have conspired to make decryption (as well as offline reading and
archiving!) quite onerous. If you lack a secure, connected machine at
the office, and have no IP (or UUCP!) service at home, I think you're
at a strong disadvantage towards reading any encrypted traffic at all.
Is there no means for you to automate offline mail reading?

The user with a 300 baud modem and a VT100 terminal at home should not
expect to be practicing secure encryption. Any better-equipped user
has the hardware needed to encrypt and decrypt securely -- they just
haven't written the software.

 &gt; If Nathan is running PGP on a multi-user system, such as campus
 &gt; machines at Ohio State, he is likely deluding himself about actual
 &gt; security. Others at the site may already have his private key and
 &gt; passphrase captured. If he is running PGP on his own private machine,
 &gt; with good Net connectivity, congratulations. Most of us--I think it's
 &gt; safe to say--don't have these options. Many are reading from
 &gt; university accounts, from commercial services like CompuServe, and
 &gt; even from multiple services (depending on location). Not running PGP
 &gt; on each and every message doesn't mean we're lazy--it means we've got
 &gt; better things to do with our time.

Point taken; but if you receive unencrypted mail on a multi-user
system, you're likely deluding yourself about its security as well. I
am motivated to provide the list to anyone that wants it without
advertising your subscription (and its traffic) to your service
provider. Anonymous posting, meet anonymous subscribers.

I can think of several reasons why cypherpunks would not be the only
list for which encrypted traffic might be desired.

 &gt; Sorry to sound harsh, but calling us lazy and software-challenged is
 &gt; not addressing the real issues.

"Indeed."

I hadn't intended this to be taken as name calling. Really.
