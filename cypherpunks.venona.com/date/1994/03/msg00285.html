I never saw the posting below here, only on sci.crypt.  It seems
relevant to the present discussion.

I did take a look at the source code to stealth pgp; it is quite simple and
nicely done.  However it doesn't do anything special about disguising the
encrypted session key.  It just strips off the two length bytes PGP puts
at the front.  Not only is this revealing, it also doesn't always work.
Apparently the program can't always reconstruct the original mpi length
if the encrypted key's size happens to be much less than the modulus.
It does print a warning in that case that the file won't be able to be
de-stealth'd successfully.

Stealth PGP is a nice start but it needs to be improved to be truly stealthy.

&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
&gt; 
&gt; I have placed Stealth1.0 up for anonymous ftp at netcom.com in
&gt; /pub/qwerty as stealth.tar.Z. I am not the author of Stealth. "Henry
&gt; Hastur" is the author. I will gladly forward mail to him if you tell me to
&gt; do so. My address is qwerty@netcom.com. So far it is only written for
&gt; Unix, so don't e-mail me asking for a DOS version or whatever. I'm just a
&gt; cheerleader and propagandist, who finally got some very kind soul to
&gt; "write me a real encryptor".
&gt; 
&gt; Why Stealth? Wired magazine just gave a plug for the Mac program "Stego"
&gt; (ftp to sumex-aim.stanford.edu in /info-mac/cmp) by Romana Machado, which
&gt; will, like any steganograph, hide a message in a carrier message. Problem
&gt; is, anybody can reverse it, and if you are using PGP, immediately tell
&gt; you are one of those drug dealing, child molesting, cryptography users ;-).
&gt; Once Stealth is incorporated into such steganographs, then people can't
&gt; easily tell that what they've extracted out of that picture of Madonna is
&gt; even a message at all. If they don't have the right secret key to decrypt
&gt; it, then all they get is garbage. "What message?!"
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) What does Stealth have to do with farming?
&gt; 2) How do stealth encryptors make the Clipper chip look like a stupid
&gt;    waste of YOUR tax money?
&gt; 
&gt; [Answers: 1) Zip, 2) By demonstrating that even if the Clipper keys are
&gt;  stolen, without your secret key they can't even tell you are using PGP].

&gt;                 Stealth V1.0 by Henry Hastur
&gt;                 ----------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth is a simple filter for PGP which strips off all identifying header
&gt; information to leave only the encrypted data in a format suitable for
&gt; steganographic use. That is, the data can be hidden in images, audio
&gt; files, text files, CAD files, and/or any other file type that may contain
&gt; random data, then sent to another person who can retrieve the data from
&gt; the file, attach headers, and PGP decrypt it.
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth is not intended to replace the standardized methods of using
&gt; encryption (e.g. ASCII-armoured PGP email) ; in an ideal world we would
&gt; all be able to send openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no
&gt; fear of reprisals, however there are often cases when this is not possible,
&gt; either because the local government does not approve of encrypted
&gt; communication, or perhaps because you are working for a company that
&gt; does not allow encrypted email but doesn't care about Mandelbrot
&gt; GIFs. This is where Stealth and steganography can come into play.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Compiling
&gt; - - ---------
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth has currently only been tested on BSD and SVR4 Unix (and as
&gt; such should work with most varieties of Unix), with both non-ANSI
&gt; compilers and ANSI compilers with 'minimal ANSI' flags. In order to
&gt; compile the program, you should just be able to extract the files
&gt; from the tar file provided, then type 'make'. If that fails you may
&gt; need to change the definition of CC and CFLAGS in the makefile to
&gt; get it to compile. On machines with gcc, the GNU C compiler, Stealth
&gt; can be compiled by simply changing the 'CC=cc' line in makefile to
&gt; 'CC=gcc'.
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth has not yet been tested on MS-DOS, but the only likely problems
&gt; are with 16-bit integers (you may need to change some occurrences of
&gt; int to long in order to get stealth to work), and you will need to
&gt; remove the -DUNIX flag from compilations. Hopefully, version 1.1
&gt; will be released shortly with full DOS compatibility.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Usage
&gt; - - -----
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth always reads from its standard input and writes to the standard
&gt; output, though when adding headers to data the data has to be stored in a
&gt; temporary file (see Security Concerns below).
&gt; 
&gt; Command line arguments :
&gt; 
&gt;         -c      Conventional encryption used rather than public key
&gt;         -a      Add headers (defaults to strip headers)
&gt;         -v      Verbose output.
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth needs to be able to find your pubring.pgp file, which it does
&gt; by first checking in the directory pointed to by $PGPPATH, then the
&gt; current directory.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Examples
&gt; - - --------
&gt; 
&gt; To encrypt a file with PGP and store it in the file pgp.stl prior to 
&gt; sending :
&gt; 
&gt; pgp -ef &lt; secrets.dat | stealth &gt; pgp.stl
&gt; 
&gt; To encrypt a file with conventional (IDEA) encryption, and pass to a
&gt; steganography program called steg_program :
&gt; 
&gt; pgp -fec &lt; secrets.dat | stealth -c | steg_program
&gt; 
&gt; To take the output from a steganographic extraction tool, add headers
&gt; for key "Your Id", and decrypt :
&gt; 
&gt; steg_program | stealth -a "Your Id" | pgp -f &gt; secrets.dat
&gt; 
&gt; To take the conventionally encrypted output from a steg program, attach
&gt; headers and decrypt :
&gt; 
&gt; steg_program | stealth -ac | pgp -f &gt; secrets.dat
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Limitations
&gt; - - -----------
&gt; 
&gt; Files can be signed, but can only be encrypted to one recipient - extra
&gt; RSA headers for all but the first recipient will be stripped from the
&gt; file. In addition, if you specify conventional encryption but pass an
&gt; RSA-encrypted file into the filter the RSA-block will be stripped. In
&gt; either case, stealth will print out warnings to inform you of this.
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth provides no support for ASCII-armoured PGP messages - it will
&gt; only work with the binary output format, and the output will have to
&gt; be converted to a useable form after processing, either with a
&gt; steganography program or a standard utility such as uuencode.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, for technical reasons there are potential problems with public
&gt; keys of size (typically) 2^n + 1 or 2^n + 2 (e.g. 513 or 1026). If you
&gt; are encrypting to a key of a peculiar size, it's possible that the algorithm
&gt; used to add headers could fail, but fortunately this can be detected while
&gt; stripping the headers, and a warning will be printed. If this warning 
&gt; appears,
&gt; you will probably want to encrypt the data again until a suitably sized
&gt; RSA-block is created.
&gt; 
&gt; It is NOT neccesary to remove garbage data that the steganography program
&gt; may have added to the end of the PGP-encrypted data. PGP output contains
&gt; an encrypted end-of-file mark that allows the program to decrypt correctly
&gt; and ignore any trailing garbage.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Security Concerns
&gt; - - -----------------
&gt; 
&gt; After passing through the stealth filter, the PGP-encrypted data is
&gt; essentially white noise, with no identifying marks, and whilst it may
&gt; well have enough peculiarities for an expert cryptanalyst to recognize
&gt; it as encrypted data, the probability is much less than would be the
&gt; case with a PGP header identifying the recipient attached.
&gt; 
&gt; One other concern is that stealth has to create a temporary file when
&gt; reading in data to attach headers, and depending on the build options
&gt; chosen the program will store it in either $PGPPATH, the current directory
&gt; or /tmp. On Unix machines, the file will be deleted as soon as it is opened,
&gt; making it difficult to capture, but on other operating systems the file
&gt; will only be deleted when it has been used. (In either case the file will
&gt; be zeroed before being closed).
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, some operating systems will use temporary files on your disk
&gt; to emulate unix pipes (e.g. MS-DOS) - these files will not be zeroed when
&gt; finished with !
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Export Restrictions
&gt; - - -------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Stealth is probably not covered by current export restrictions under the
&gt; US ITAR regs, but I'm not a lawyer, so if in doubt check it out yourself.
&gt; It was written outside the US and imported, so should soon be available
&gt; on some European ftp sites as well as US sites.
