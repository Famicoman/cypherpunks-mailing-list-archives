[It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who "nobody" is:]

&gt;I can't say that everything that billg does or makes arrangements for 
&gt;with his clout will be defensible;  I can point out that any 
&gt;arrangements which he makes with others depends upon those individual's 
&gt;consent, their agreeableness, and not to coercion or the elimination of 
&gt;choice altogether.  (I don't know all of the details of how the closing

&gt;The threat of a monopolization of power which  (someone)  mentioned 
&gt;as being presented by Microsoft's dominance in the market is not of the 
&gt;same type as is presented by the government's.  From what I know about 
&gt;"intellectual property", this concept is supposed to establish the 
&gt;source of what has been produced (software) as belonging to its 
&gt;creator, and therefore as something akin to an object or service which 
&gt;can be traded and from which one can receive payment.  It's a way to 
&gt;make a living, in other words, based on the recognition of a value.


I think we agree philosophically.  Where we diverge is in our understanding
of things-as-they-are.  I contend that large companies, MS being one 
example, often enlist the government and its coercive powers in their
service.

One issue where I think I've seen MS's hand is "intellectual property".
My concern about "intellectual property" is that MS and some others have
changed the terms of the debate ["property" is protected more than
"privilege"] and the law to further their own interests, to the detriment
of the rest of us.

&gt;The only way that I can think of to counter the dominance of one 
&gt;company in the free exchange of goods is to desist from the purchase of 
&gt;that company's offerings, or better yet to produce better ones and make 
&gt;a better case for them with the buying public.

We need to  reduce the power of government so that it cannot be enlisted 
in any company's service.

That said, I am following your advice:  With the exception of the
ubiquitous DOS/Windows operating systems, I've gotten rid of every MS 
product on my machines.  If OS/2 ever grows up [can handle a 14.4k 
faxmodem for example], I'll be MS free.

One example of why I'm ticked at SPA folks ...

&gt;Date:  [Recently]
&gt;To:    [Us]
&gt;From:  [Them]

&gt;Comprehensive Computer Inspection

&gt;Beginning [Soon], [We] will conduct a comprehensive inspection ...

&gt;...[T]the sofware inventory and licensing compliance issue will be 
&gt;emphasized.  Each user should make certain that the report from the 
&gt;latest sofware inventory list is up-to-date and is readily 
&gt;available for the inspector. (...)

&gt;When confronted by potential inspectors...  No "smart" remarks ...

I'm tired of this shit.
Now, imagine if SPA owned the internet....
