Mr. May et al:

The couple of lines re pornographic language seems to have diverted
the apprecation of the problem reported in the message.  This message
is about whether or not Compu$erve should get away scott free for bullying
one of their subscribers while they attempt to steal use of his trade-
marked software which he had been offering on Compu$erve for some time.

Please reread the msg.

&gt; Forwarded from a message on InterNet:
&gt; Forwarded message:
&gt; &gt; X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL8]
&gt; &gt; To supporters of freedom of speech - please read, act and
&gt; &gt; share this as your conscience dictates:
&gt; &gt; Unofficially excerpted from Infoworld 3/7/94 Brian Livingston's
&gt; &gt; Window Manager column.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Can CompuServe succeed in silencing Windows dissenters?  Having
&gt; &gt; your electronic mail account cut off is the modern equivalent
&gt; &gt; of solitary confinement.  Many services I use, such as Microsoft
&gt; &gt; Windows forums, exist exclusively on systems such as the CompuServe
&gt; &gt; Information Service.  There is no other place for information.

&gt; &gt; "That's why I took notice when CompuServe threatened to cut off 
&gt; &gt; a subscriber's account if he even mentioned on-line a lawsuit that
&gt; &gt; the company filed against him.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Compuserve filed suit January 31 in Federal District Court in Ohio
&gt; &gt; against Richard S. Patterson, the developer of a shareware program
&gt; &gt; called Windows Navigator (WinNAV), which he has distributed on
&gt; &gt; Compuserve for several years.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This suit came about after Patterson complained on a Compuserve 
&gt; &gt; forum last December that the company's plans to release a product
&gt; &gt; called Windows Navigator infringed upon his trademarks.

&gt; &gt; "Prior to initiating the suit, Compuserve modified the name of its
&gt; &gt; product to CompuServe Navigator, Windows Version.  It asks the court
&gt; &gt; to find that Patterson has "no trademark rights" that it has 
&gt; &gt; infringed, and for an unspecified monetary penalty.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; "I don't know who will prevail in this suit.  But what really
&gt; &gt; bothers me is this threat in a letter to Patterson dated January 31,
&gt; &gt; from Kevin J. Osterkamp, Compuserve's attorney in the firm of 
&gt; &gt; Roetzel and Andress, of Columbus, Ohio;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "I am as legal counsel for Compuserve compelled to advise you that
&gt; &gt; it is Compuserves position that you will be terminated if you
&gt; &gt; mention, discuss, or comment upon the lawsuit or the issues
&gt; &gt; related thereto as a part of the CompuServe Information Service.
&gt; &gt; Termination will also result from any other disparagment of
&gt; &gt; Compuserve, its management, employees, or business practices.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "I've never met Mr. Patterson, but I know him tangentially from
&gt; &gt; his other software, Zip Tools, which appears in Windows Gizmos.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "My columns have promoted CompuServe many times, so I asked for 
&gt; &gt; it's position.  The gist of the reply I received from Mr. Oster-
&gt; &gt; kamp was this:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Regarding the case of Compuserve vs. Patterson, my ethical 
&gt; &gt; obligations (and Mr. Patterson's) prohibit me from commenting
&gt; &gt; directly on the case.  I can, however, assure you that our 
&gt; &gt; request that Mr. Patterson stop using Compuserve's online
&gt; &gt; services to disparage the company is simply good, old-fashioned
&gt; &gt; common sense.  After all, why should CompuServe - or any online
&gt; &gt; service - allow a disgruntled party the opportunity to bad-
&gt; &gt; mouth the company in its own forum?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Why, indeed?  It's called "a free exchange of ideas."  It is
&gt; &gt; much sought after by people around the world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "If AT&amp;T could cut off my phone because I criticized them while
&gt; &gt; using long distance, we would be in very serious danger of losing
&gt; &gt; our freedom.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "It is unclear whether electronic services are "common carriers"
&gt; &gt; (like AT&amp;T) that must carry all communications, or "publishers"
&gt; &gt; (like magazines) that are legally responsible for the words they
&gt; &gt; choose to print.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "But Compuserve knows which it prefers to be.  In separate cases,
&gt; &gt; it has been sued by the National Music Publishers Association and
&gt; &gt; Cubby Inc. for distributing material uploaded by subscribers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Compuserve argues that it should be free from any liability
&gt; &gt; because "it is a distributor and not a publisher."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Our future "information highway" will inevitably center on just 
&gt; &gt; five or six giant corporations.  That's why it's so important
&gt; &gt; that access not be denied to someone whom these entities don't
&gt; &gt; like.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Do me a favor.  Sit down right now and tap out a message to
&gt; &gt; Mauryve Cox, the CEO of Compuserve.  His I.D. number is
&gt; &gt; 70003,1550.  Tell him how important it is to you that no one
&gt; &gt; be denied access to Compuserve forums.  Send me a copy,
&gt; &gt; if my account still works after this column appears.
