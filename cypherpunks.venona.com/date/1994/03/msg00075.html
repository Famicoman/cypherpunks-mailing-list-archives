Has anyone heard of this organization?  The below popped into
my mail box unsolicited.  This is the "E-mail Version" but there

&gt;RECOMMENDED READING FOR Privacy Seekers, Spies, Private Investigators, 
&gt;Attorneys, Skip Tracers, Security Consultants, Law Enforcement Personnel, 
&gt;Mercenaries, Collection Agents, Anarchists, Tax Resisters, Secret 
&gt;Organizations, and The Persecuted and Oppressed.  
&gt;
&gt;INTRODUCTION
&gt;
&gt;HOW TO USE THIS ARTICLE EFFECTIVELY:  Place yourself in the position of 
&gt;someone requiring maxium privacy AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.  You'll gain

&gt;concrete insight and intuition that will help you avoid those seeking to 
&gt;locate you, whom we will call the "tracer".  Seek to develop your own 
&gt;individual and unique sense of intuition.  Intuition is informed by 
knowledge, 
&gt;and knowledge should be informed by intuition.  This somewhat intangible 
&gt;quality can make the crucial difference between safety and exposure of worse.
&gt;
&gt;HOW MOST MISSING PERSONS ARE FOUND:  If the truth were known, skip tracing is

&gt;not an extremely difficult profession, and can be very lucrative.  The P.I. 
&gt;(Private Investigator) is not the only kind of tracer.  When we speak of 
&gt;tracer, we mean: P.I.s, Feds and Police, government and private spies and 
&gt;intelligence agencies, collection agencies, bounty hunters, or anyone who 
&gt;might want to locate you.  To find almost all of your "regular" skips, just 
&gt;learn the readily available methods.  There are more books about missing 
&gt;persons than any other area of investigation.  It represents the "bread and 
&gt;butter" of many P.I. agencies.  Any good tracer will be signed up with one or

&gt;more computer search services, and may locate many targets in just a few 
hours 
&gt;or days.
&gt;
&gt;HOW MISSING PERSONS STAY "MISSING":  Our privacy seeker is serious, and has 
&gt;made privacy a way of life.  He is hard to find, and makes up perhaps ten 
&gt;percent or less of all missing persons cases.  Some investigators label these

&gt;cases "difficult" or "impossible" to locate, often charging large fees 
anyway.  
&gt;Some skips are fleeing criminal prosecution, prison, or engage in illegal 
&gt;enterprises which demand absolute secrecy and security.  A high-level of
&gt;sercecy and security is required for other legitimate enterprises too:  
&gt;private investigation, personal bodyguard, critical and/or controversial 
&gt;research, labs, and inventors to mention a few.  Unpopular or "deviant" 
&gt;lifestyles, beliefs, and practices lead some individuals to distance 
&gt;themselves from "society" as much as they can.  Certain totalitarian trends 
in 
&gt;modern society cause some to want to avoid contact with government "Big 
&gt;Brother" as much as possible.  Persons in failed witness "protection" 
programs 
&gt;where security has been breached may trun to the private sector after being 
&gt;compromised by feds or other cops.  Additional non-criminal reasons may 
&gt;include: oppression from political, terrorist and dangerous groups, flight 
&gt;from abusive families or cults, or fleeing threats of violence perpetrated by

&gt;individuals.  It is not our purpose to judge or evaluate, and other reasons 
&gt;exist.  All have in common as distinct need for privacy.  The techniques 
&gt;discussed are used to achieve a successful level of privacy and secrecy, but 
&gt;require DEDICATION AND THOROUGHNESS to be effective.
&gt;
&gt;SECURE COMMUNICATIONS
&gt;
&gt;MAIL:  Get all your mail at a P.O. Box in a ficticious name.  You will have 
to 
&gt;fill out U.S.P.S. Form 1093 with a physical address (required), but you can 
&gt;later "move".  Sometimes the post office will ask for an update of your 1093.
 
&gt;This can be routine, but could indicate that someone is mail-tracing you.  
&gt;They may have already received your "dud" address, and have continued their 
&gt;inquiry by passing this information on the the P.O., who then ask you for the

&gt;updated 1093.  The tracer can get a lot of free work done this way, but he 
&gt;also runs the risk of alerting the skip.  The final word here is WATCH YOUR 
&gt;MAIL.
&gt;
&gt;MAIL DROPS:  A "mail drop" or private postal box is sometimes recommended, 
but 
&gt;"caveat emptor" is the watchword.  These services are available in most 
areas, 
&gt;and are used by numerous individuals and businesses for legitimate reasons.  
&gt;You can provide additional cover by having your mail go through a series of 
&gt;drops, but don't forget there are directories of these addresses.  Because of

&gt;Reverse Skip Tracing (discussed later), we don't recommend mail drops when 
&gt;seeking maximum security.  Safest of all is to establish an address where you

&gt;(or a trusted friend or associate) can receive your mail.  For the price of 
&gt;some mail drops, you might rent a small cheap room or apartment in the 
"seedy" 
&gt;area of town (if a particular type of address is not needed) where you can 
get 
&gt;your mail in a group of mailboxes for that building.  You can pick up your 
&gt;mail at varying times, or have someone else do it for you.  Make friends with

&gt;the superintendent of a building so that your mail is delivered with that of 
&gt;the residents (you don't live there, of course).  A cover story can easily 
&gt;account for your need of this service.  A "homeless" person might persuade a 
&gt;mission, church or other agency to receive his mail, but the amount of mail 
&gt;should be small as not to attract attention.  These suggestions work best if 
&gt;you don't get a lot of mail, and are not involved in illegal or other 
&gt;compromising situations, which might lead to blackmail, exposure, or worse!
&gt;
&gt;GENERAL DELIVERY:  Sounds hokey, but it's a very good cover.  The Main Post 
&gt;Office in a town or city is probably the best location as they are the 
busiest 
&gt;and least likely to remember or notice you.  Try to appear properly 
&gt;nondescript when going for your mail, and don't establish a pattern.
&gt;
&gt;CREATE A STREET ADDRESS FROM A P.O. BOX:  A box is not suitable for all 
&gt;situations.  You will need a street address.  Every post office has a 
physical 
&gt;street address, so send your mail there.  Example: You are Mr. A. Skipper, 
Box 
&gt;911, Metropolis, TX 78444-0911.  Find out the street address of the P.O., and

&gt;write your address like this: Mr. A. Skipper, 1411 Main Street, Number 911, 
&gt;Metropolis, TX 78444-0911.  All boxholders now have an individual 9-digit 
&gt;zipcode; its use should insure you get mail so addressed.  Some 
correspondents 
&gt;tell us that an occassional nosey postal employee will say this is not 
&gt;permissable, but generally you shouldn't have any trouble.  If you insist the

&gt;employee show you chapter and verse in the administrative codes, you will 
&gt;probably prevail, but you may draw unwanted attention.  In another instance 
of 
&gt;a branch post office in a shopping center, there was difficulty obtaining the

&gt;actual physical address as the employee claimed it was never used.  Even 
after 
&gt;the address was obtained, some mail continued to be improperly returned to 
&gt;sender.  You will have to weigh each case, but we recommend that you try 
&gt;another post office or branch if you run into snags at a particular location.
&gt;
&gt;REVERSE SKIP TRACING:  Some ads for mail drops are just a ploy to get your 
&gt;name and address, which is crossed referenced with lists of known missing 
&gt;persons.  Even "legitimate" drops may sell their client lists, or allow 
&gt;tracers to go through the names.  You can rest assured that every mail drop 
&gt;will cooperate with the police or feds if they come around asking about you 
&gt;(or your assumed name).  Many books recommend use of mail drops, but we see 
&gt;too may possible hangups.  Is it possible that some of these "expert" missing

&gt;persons authors are just making sure that maildrops have a steady clientel 
for 
&gt;reverse tracing?
&gt;
&gt;ANSWERING ADVERTISEMENTS:  Keep your eyes open, and examine closely what is 
&gt;recommended in some "inside information" or "underground" publications.  Be 
&gt;careful in answering any potentially risky advertisement.  An example is 
found 
&gt;in magazines catering to drug users and advocates, such as "High Times 
&gt;Magazine".  Many ads are probable D.E.A. fronts, especially the ones for 
&gt;information or paraphernalia for growing pot (marajuana), mushrooms, ect..  
&gt;An ad for information on privacy, false I.D., or illegal scams (by little or 
&gt;unknown companies), may be a front for reverse skip tracers - or someone else

&gt;tracing people like you!  Don't avoid seeking new information, but be sure 
&gt;your postal privacy is well protected.  If your return address is traced, be 
&gt;sure they come up empty-handed.
&gt;
&gt;REGISTERED AND CERTIFIED MAIL and C.O.D.s:  Once you have established your 
&gt;P.O. Box, the only mail coming to your real address should be "occupant" 
mail.  
&gt;If Registered or Certified mail does come (could be C.O.D. or Insured Parcel 
&gt;Post or ANY mail requiring a signature), say you are someone else, say the 
&gt;person moved and left no address, moved months or years ago, say anything, 
but 
&gt;NEVER sign for mail - no exceptions!  The carrier is out of line to ask who 
&gt;YOU are, so this should work.  Tracers use this as a cheap and effective way 
&gt;to locate skips.
&gt;
&gt;PACKAGES AND DELIVERIES:  Always pay with money orders.  Your receipt is 
proof 
&gt;enough if required, and virtually impossible to trace.  Keep the receipt 
&gt;blank; don't fill it in unless needed.  Although Federal Express, UPS, and 
&gt;other couriers say they can't deliver to a P.O. Box, you can still use it.  
&gt;Say on the order, "notify by mail at my P.O. Box for delivery instructions". 

&gt;This causes a little delay, but the parcel agent will simply send you a post
&gt;card with an 800 phone number so you can call with delivery instructions.  
&gt;Have it sent to a safe address, or don't give them an address at all.  Pick 
up 
&gt;the package at their office.  NEVER have ANYTHING delivered to your real 
&gt;address!  That way, if anything does come, you will be alerted, and refuse 
&gt;delivery as described.
&gt;
&gt;TELEGRAMS:  We think of them as old-fashioned, but telegrams are still 
around.  
&gt;It's not a bad ruse either, and should be treated same as above.
&gt;
&gt;MAIL TRACING:  This is a cheap and useful tool, and is often the opening 
&gt;gambit in efforts to locate you.  Look out for any suspicious mail!  All P.O.

&gt;Box information on U.S.P.S. Form 1093 can be accessed by others.  Numerous 
&gt;cover letters are avaiable, but the best way is to state that the individual 
&gt;used the P.O. Box for business purposes, or that a court action is intended 
or 
&gt;in the process.  The P.O. will release the records, including the physical 
&gt;street address you gave them.  See any good book on researching public 
records 
&gt;for more details.  If a tracer sends you a letter, and it doesn't come back, 
&gt;he may be enticed to advance another level, such as a personal visit and/or 
&gt;surveillance.  To deflect First Class and all other mail, consider buying 
&gt;(through the mail of course) a small rubber stamp saying "Unknown - Return To

&gt;Sender", "Deceased", "Moved", "No Fowarding Order On File" or similar P.O. 
&gt;wording.  Be sure to drop it in a mail box NOT served by your regular post 
&gt;office or branch.  Beware of responding to offers asking you to call for 
&gt;confirmation because you have "won" a free cruise or whatever.  A postcard, 
&gt;flyer or letter may offer a lucrative employment in your profession (or 
&gt;something else you need or want) with a number to call collect.  It may be a 
&gt;ruse by a tracer.  If family or friends' names are known, you may receive an 
&gt;"emergency call" notifying you of the "death" of a loved one.  Don't respond-

&gt;no exceptions!  Have a backup plan for emergency communications with friends 
&gt;or family if you absolutely must have it.  So if a call comes, you KNOW it's 
a 
&gt;ruse, and do not respond.  Advance planning is crucial.
&gt;
&gt;MAIL COVERS: If feds or other cops are tracing you, they may establish a Mail

&gt;Cover for a 30 day period, with extensions.  A mail cover does NOT require a 
&gt;warrant, so it's easy to use.  It is initiated by the agency working directly

&gt;with the local post office.  They record ALL the information on the OUTSIDE 
of 
&gt;the envelope, based on the premise that this is "public" information.  They 
&gt;identify regular correspondents, contacts, abnks, credit cards, other mail 
&gt;transactions, suppliers, business associates, and more.  Supposedly this does

&gt;not delay your mail, but who knows?  It seems that it would delay it (given 
&gt;the efficiency of most P.O. workers) or that you might receive mail in large 
&gt;amounts when you usually do not.  Monitor postmarks, and if you receive a lot

&gt;of mail, you should have a good idea how long it takes mail to reach you from

&gt;various parts of the country.  ALWAYS WATCH MAIL AND DELIVERY PATTERNS.
&gt;
&gt;SENDING "SENSITIVE" MAIL:  If you use a mail drop, change it from time to 
&gt;time, and always run your mail through more than one drop.  When quicker 
&gt;delivery is needed, consider private delivery services.  Drop the package off

&gt;at a pick-up point - do NOT have them come to you.  Vary your service between

&gt;different carriers, and do NOT use post office Express Mail, particularly if 
&gt;moving detectable contraband.  It is routinely X-rayed and "sniffed".  The 
&gt;bus can be sued as numerous parcels are shipped everyday.  Common items 
&gt;shipped are tools, auto parts and equipment of all sorts, but many suitcases 
&gt;and cardboard boxes as well.  Even if you just have an envelope, wrap it in a

&gt;large box and weigh it down so that it is similar to other boxes being 
&gt;handled.  Use a typewriter for anything written, preferably a newer electric 
&gt;model that doesn't leave a distinctive mark or indicate anything about your 
&gt;key pressure.  For short notes, ect., consider taking your paper to a large 
&gt;discount store where typewriters are set out for your demostration.  If 
you're 
&gt;typing something that takes a minute of so, this is a good source.  Libraries

&gt;often have typewriters available for use, so use a cover identity to get a 
&gt;library card.  Better yet copy centers and business centers where 
typewriters, 
&gt;computers, printers, and copy machines are located together.  No one will 
&gt;require I.D. to rent you a typewriter for a half hour, and no one will 
&gt;remember you among hunderds of users.  For very sensitive correspondence, 
&gt;photocopy the letter after you type it, and send this copy as the "original".
 
&gt;Develop an unreadable scrawl as your signature.  It's not always necessary to

&gt;put your return address, and it is not required.  You must be sure that the 
&gt;mail is correctly addressed, and that nothing inside would compromise your 
&gt;location or identity if it were opened by the authorities (or a tracer - yes,

&gt;they may violate the law!).
&gt;
&gt;AVOIDING MAIL TRACERS AT YOUR REAL ADDRESS:  Remove the mail box.  Remove any

&gt;signs from doors, windows, outside or walls, which may draw unwanted 
&gt;attention.  Never put YOUR name(s) on anything, and remove any old 
nameplates.  
&gt;You can remove address numbers.  If the postman has no mailbox or no proper 
&gt;address, he cannot deliver, and mail is returned "Undeliverable As 
Addressed".
&gt;
&gt;MAILING LISTS, PERIODICALS, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS: Use the Direct Marketing 
&gt;Association, P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735 to get off most lists.  The

&gt;IRS uses sophisticated mailing lists to apprehend tax evaders, categorized by

&gt;high-salary professions, spending patterns, lifestyles, and purchases like 
&gt;vacations and luxury cars.  Get off as many lists as you can.  If you receive

&gt;"junk" mail (or other unwanted mail), mark it "addressee unknown - unable to 
&gt;foward", and drop it in a street mail box, preferably one not served by your 
&gt;local post office or substation.  List users will delete your name to save 
&gt;future costs.  Do this consistently; you'll be off more lists.  When you 
move, 
&gt;do NOT send "Change of Address" notices to anyone.  Start new subscriptions 
&gt;under your new name at your new P.O. Box.  If you subscribe to "exotic" or 
&gt;unusual publications, you may be traced by this connection to your old life. 

&gt;Large publications are probably OK, but if your interest is "The Vegetarian 
&gt;Party Times", or Gum Label Collectors Quarterly", which has only a few 
&gt;subscribers, you're taking a chance of exposure.  NEVER SUBSCRIBE TO A 
&gt;NEWSPAPER OR ANY OTHER SERVICE USING A DELIVERY PERSON.  Tracers know these 
&gt;individuals are aften talkative, nosey, and area a wealth of information 
about 
&gt;you and your habits.  Buy it at a news rack, read it at the library, or have 
&gt;it sent to your P.O. Box.  WRITE THE TRACER A LETTER, AND TELL HIM YOUR 
&gt;"LOCATION":  An Air Mail letter from Guatemala City, Paga Pago, Cairo or 
&gt;Australia saying you're there, and never plan to return to the USA can end a 
&gt;lot of tracing activities, particularly those of collection agencies.  You 
&gt;need a cooperative person in the other country to remail the letter.  
Business 
&gt;agents for banking and forming corporations, and offices for rent in places 
&gt;like Panama, the Isle of Man or other locations could be used.  Check the 
&gt;classified section of The International Herald Tribune Newspaper, 
212-755-8785 
&gt;for leads.  Some banks in Europe and other countries have good 
confidentiality 
&gt;laws, and, if you have an account, some may receive and foward your mail for
&gt;you.  Letters from diverse locations over a period of time might convince a 
&gt;tracer that you are roaming about the world, another expatriate American 
&gt;(there are lots of them) running from responsibilities back home.  A word to 
&gt;the wise: watch out for mail drops abroad - tracers have lists and 
directories 
&gt;of these addresses.
&gt;
&gt;TELEPHONE SECURITY: Depending on who's after you, there may be no security at

&gt;all!  The feds (and others) can turn a phone into an area "bug" with proper 
&gt;equipment.  If you must have a phone, be aware of the latest technology (an 
&gt;excellent soure is "Full Disclosure Magazine, which is published monthly by 
&gt;First Ammendment Press, P.O. Box 67, Lowell, Michigan 49331 USA).  Be sure to

&gt;list it in a fictitious name or business name.  I'm told that Ma Bell now 
&gt;wants you to be a corporation to do this.  That's OK - be a corporation!  If 
&gt;they ask for a corporation registration number, find out what one looks like 
&gt;in your state, and provide it.  If you receive a message or letter asking you

&gt;to call someone collect, don't do it!  This is an old tracing technique.  If 
&gt;you don't give yourself away in the conversation, the tracer will simply call

&gt;the operator, ask for the time, charges and origin of the call and phone 
&gt;number.  Since the tracer is paying for the charges, the operator will be 
&gt;happy to cooperate.  Avoid cordless &amp; cellular phones and radio 
communication.  
&gt;Police (and anyone else) can listen and legally record these conversations, 
&gt;which are exempt from wiretap laws.  You're using the open airwaves, so your 
&gt;communications are literally open to anyone who wants to listen.  Numerous 
&gt;scrambling devices are available.  Some cordless phones have variable 
security 
&gt;codes, and you could combine this with a voice scrambler (one type of which 
is 
&gt;available from Shomer-Tec, P.O. Box 2039, Bellingham, WA 98227).  This may be

&gt;enough, depending on who's tracing you, but what one computer scrambles, 
&gt;another computer can eventually unscramble.  This also goes for any "codes" 
&gt;you might device or use.  In the ever-changing world of communications 
&gt;technology and spy devices, "never say never" about anything, and always 
&gt;assume that someone is at least one step ahead of you in sophistication.  
STAY 
&gt;AWAY FROM ALL ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IF YOU CAN.  If you must communicate 
&gt;over these media, take every possible precaution.  Best of all - don't have a

&gt;phone.  It's easier than you think.  A lot of phone use is habit anyway.  If 
&gt;you must make calls, use safe locations like a friend's home or a secure pay 
&gt;phone, but don't establish a regular pattern anywhere.  
&gt;
&gt;FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATIONS:  In past times, when your telephone wasn't 
secure 
&gt;you could usually set up a face-to-face meeting.  The ready availability of 
&gt;numerous "bugs" has changed all of that, especially the ultra-small micro 
&gt;varieties.  Depending on the level of security required, it can be very 
&gt;expensive to deploy counter devices and detectors.  They may be useless, and 
&gt;give you a false sense of security.  Let's consider a few of the 
&gt;possibilities.  If your meeting place is known, bugs can be planted in 
&gt;advance.  Your contact will probably be bugless, but the whole area would 
&gt;already be compromised.  Simple parabolic ears and smaller listening devices 
&gt;can easily be employed if cover can be established.  These are generally 
&gt;defeated by meeting in large open spaces, yet this presents its own 
additional
&gt;risks.  Technology advances rapidly in theis field.  What was science fiction

&gt;yesterday is common equipment tomorrow.  Never underestimate the 
technological 
&gt;capacity of the tracer.  Who can you trust when it comes to bugs?  Trust no 
&gt;one!  Even a friend or "safe" contact (or their car or home) can be bugged 
&gt;without their knowledge.  After the tracer has identified your contact, he 
&gt;will observe HIS patterns, just waiting for YOU to show up.  This is 
&gt;particularly successful if you have a girlfriend, pusher, money source, or 
&gt;anyone/anywhere you just HAVE to visit.  The tracer knows you're eventually 
&gt;coming, so it's just a matter of time.  Your contact could be compromised by 
&gt;threats to his (or his family's) safety, or by blackmail.   Very few people 
&gt;will remain totally loyal under such circumstances.  You can hope your 
contact
&gt;will at least warn you if this is happening, but don't count on it.  Watch 
&gt;friends and contacts for any signs which might alert you.  When someone who 
&gt;was helpful, jovial and friendly begins to act reserved, afraid, and uneasy, 
&gt;they may be under just this kind of pressure.
&gt;
&gt;A FINAL WORD ON COMMUNICATIONS: Our purpose is to get you in the habit of 
&gt;thinking, observing, and COMMUNICATING from the position of someone who 
&gt;requires absolute maximum privacy and security.  Its purpose is not to create

&gt;paranoia, but don't forget the old saying: "Just because you're paranoid 
&gt;doesn't mean they're not really out to get you".
