&gt;Subject: Privacy As Roadkill
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Jacking in from a "Private No More" Port:
&gt; 
&gt;Washington, DC -- If privacy isn't already the first victim of
&gt;roadkill along the information superhighway, then it's about to be.
&gt; 
&gt;A law enforcement panel addressing the Administration's Information
&gt;Infrastructure Task Force Working Group on Privacy told a public
&gt;meeting here last week that it wanted to "front load" the National
&gt;Information Infrastructure with trap door technologies that would
&gt;allow them to easy access to digital conversations;  eavesdropping
&gt;on any conversation or capturing electronic communications
&gt;midstream.
&gt; 
&gt;But only for "the bad guys."  Us honest, hard working, law abiding
&gt;citizens have nothing to fear from these law enforcement agencies
&gt;selling out our privacy rights to make their jobs easier.  Nope, we
&gt;can rest easy, knowing that child pornographers, drug traffickers
&gt;and organized crime families will be sufficiently thwarted by law
&gt;enforcement's proposed built-in gadgetry for the national
&gt;information infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt;There's just a small problem:  Law enforcement agencies, any law
&gt;enforcement agency, has yet to prove it needs all these proposed
&gt;digital trap doors.  In fact, according to a U.S. Assistant
&gt;Attorney appearing on the panel, "Right now most law enforcement
&gt;personnel don't have any idea what the NII is."
&gt; 
&gt;Gore Gives Go Ahead
&gt;===================
&gt; 
&gt;Panel members, representing the Justice Dept., FBI and U.S.
&gt;Attorney's office, said that they took Vice President Gore's
&gt;promise that the White House would work to ensure that the NII
&gt;would "help law enforcement agencies thwart criminals and
&gt;terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications to commit
&gt;crimes," as tacit approval of their proposals to push for digital
&gt;wiretap access and government mandated encryption policies.
&gt; 
&gt;Gore buried those remarks deep in a speech he made in Los Angeles
&gt;earlier this month when the Administration first fleshed out how it
&gt;planned to rewrite the rules for communications in a newer, perhaps
&gt;more enlightened age.  Those remarks went unnoticed by the
&gt;mainstream press.  But readers here were forewarned.
&gt; 
&gt;Fuck Ross Perot's NAFTA-induced "giant sucking sound."  That
&gt;"thump" you just heard was Law Enforcement running over the privacy
&gt;rights of the American public on its way to the information
&gt;superhighway.  The real crime is that the collision barely dented
&gt;the damn fender.
&gt; 
&gt;This cunning and calculated move by law enforcement to install
&gt;interception technologies all along the information superhighway
&gt;was blithely referred to as "proactive" law enforcement policy by
&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney, Northern Dist. of California Kent Walker. 
&gt;Designing these technologies into future networks, which include
&gt;all telephone systems, would ensure that law enforcement
&gt;organizations "have the same capabilities that we all enjoy right
&gt;now," Walker said.
&gt; 
&gt;With today's wiretap operations, the Feds must get a court to
&gt;approve their request, but only after supplying enough evidence
&gt;warrant one.  But Walker seemed to be lobbying for the opposite. 
&gt;Giving the Feds the ability to listen in first and give
&gt;justification later was "no big difference," he said. Besides, "it
&gt;would save time and money."
&gt; 
&gt;It's Us vs. Them
&gt;=================
&gt; 
&gt;For Walker privacy issues weighed against law enforcement needs are
&gt;black and white, or rather "good guys" vs. "bad guys."   For
&gt;example, he said the rapid rise of private (read: non-government
&gt;controlled) encryption technologies didn't mean law enforcement
&gt;would have to work harder.  On the contrary, "it only means we'll
&gt;catch less criminals," he said.                    
&gt; 
&gt;But if law enforcement is merely concerned with the task of "just
&gt;putting the bad guys in jail," as James Settle, head of the FBI's
&gt;National Computer Crime Squad states, then why are we seeing an
&gt;unprecedented move by government intelligence agencies into areas
&gt;they have historically shied from?  Because law enforcement
&gt;agencies know their window of opportunity for asserting their
&gt;influence is right now, right at the time the government is about
&gt;to take on a fundamental shift in how it deals privacy issues
&gt;within the networks that make up the NII, says David Sobel, general
&gt;counsel for Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
&gt;(CPSR), who also spoke as a panel member.
&gt; 
&gt;"Because of law enforcement's concerns (regarding digital
&gt;technologies), we're seeing an unprecedented involvement by federal
&gt;security agencies in the domestic law enforcement activities,"
&gt;Sobel said.
&gt; 
&gt;Sobel dropped-kicked this chilling fact from behind the closed
&gt;doors of the Clinton Administration into the IITF's lap:  For the
&gt;first time in history, the National Security Agency (NSA) "is now
&gt;deeply involved in the design of the public telecommunications
&gt;network."
&gt; 
&gt;Go ahead.  Read it again.
&gt; 
&gt;Sobel backs up his claims with hundreds of pages of previously
&gt;classified memos and reports obtained under the Freedom of
&gt;Information Act.  The involvement of the NSA in the design of our
&gt;telephone networks is, Sobel believes, a violation of federal
&gt;statutes.
&gt; 
&gt;Sobel's also concerned that the public might soon be looking down
&gt;the throat of a classified telecommunications standard being
&gt;created.  Another move he calls "unprecedented," is that if the
&gt;NSA, FBI and other law enforcement organizations have their way,
&gt;the design of the national telecommunications network will end up
&gt;classified and withheld from the public.
&gt; 
&gt;Sobel is dead bang on target with his warnings.
&gt; 
&gt;The telecommunications industry and FBI have set up an ad hoc
&gt;working group to see if a technical fix for digital wiretapping can
&gt;be found to make the Bureau happy.  That way, legislation doesn't
&gt;need to be passed that might mandate such FBI access and stick the
&gt;Baby Bells with eating the full cost of reengineering their
&gt;networks.
&gt; 
&gt;This joint group was formed during a March 26, 1992 meeting at
&gt;FBI's Quantico, Va., facilities, according previously classified
&gt;FBI documents released under Freedom of Information Act. The group
&gt;was only formalized late last year, working under the auspices of
&gt;the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS).  The
&gt;joint industry-FBI group operates under the innocuous sounding name
&gt;of the Electronic Communications Service Provider Committee
&gt;(ECSPC).
&gt; 
&gt;The ECSPC meets monthly with intent of seeking a technological
&gt;"solution" to the FBI's request for putting a trap door into
&gt;digital switches that would allow them easy access to those
&gt;conversations. To date, no industry solution has been found for the
&gt;digital wiretap problem, according to Kenneth Raymond, a Nynex
&gt;telephone company engineer, who is the industry co-chairman of the
&gt;group.
&gt; 
&gt;Oh, there's also a small, but nagging problem:  The FBI hasn't
&gt;provided a concrete basis that such solutions are needed, Raymond
&gt;said.  CPSR's Sobel raised these same points during the panel
&gt;discussion.
&gt; 
&gt;The telecommunications industry is focused on "trying to evaluate
&gt;just what is the nature of the [digital access] problem and how we
&gt;can best solve it in some reasonable way that is consistent with
&gt;cost and demand," Raymond said.   One solution might be to write
&gt;digital wiretap access into future switch specifications, he said.
&gt; 
&gt;If and when the industry does find that solution, do you think the
&gt;FBI will put out a press release to tell us about it? "I doubt it
&gt;very much," said FBI agent Barry Smith with the Bureau's
&gt;Congressional Affairs office. "It will be done quietly, with no
&gt;media fanfare."
&gt; 
&gt;Is it just me or are these headlights getting REALLY close?
&gt; 
&gt;The FBI's Settle is also adamant about trap door specifications
&gt;being written into any blue prints for the National Information
&gt;Infrastructure. But there's a catch.  Settle calls these "security
&gt;measures," because they'll give his office a better chance at
&gt;"catching bad guys."  He wants all networks "to be required to
&gt;install some kind of standard for security."  And who's writing
&gt;those standards?  You guessed it:  The NSA with input from the FBI
&gt;and other assorted spook agencies.
&gt; 
&gt;Settle defends these standards saying that the "best we have going
&gt;for us is that the criminal element hasn't yet figured out how to
&gt;use this stuff [encryption and networks in general].  When they do,
&gt;we'll be in trouble. We want to stay ahead of the curve."
&gt; 
&gt;In the meantime, his division has to hustle.  The FBI currently has
&gt;only 25 "net literate" personnel, Settle admitted. "Most of these
&gt;were recruited 2 years ago," he said.  Most have computer science
&gt;degrees and were systems administrators at time, he said.
&gt; 
&gt;You think that's funny?  Hell, the Net is a still small community,
&gt;relatively speaking.  One of your friends is probably an FBI Net
&gt;Snitch, working for Settle.  Don't laugh.
&gt; 
&gt;Don't Look Now, Your Privacy Is Showing
&gt;=======================================
&gt; 
&gt;The law enforcement establishment doesn't think you really know
&gt;what you expect when it comes to privacy.
&gt; 
&gt;U.S. Attorney Walker says:  "If you ask the public, 'Is privacy
&gt;more important than catching criminals?'  They'll tell you, 'No.'"
&gt; 
&gt;(Write him with your own thoughts, won't you?)
&gt; 
&gt;Because of views like Walker's, the Electronic Communications
&gt;Privacy Act (ECPA) "needs to be broader," said Mike Godwin, legal
&gt;services counsel, for Electronic Frontier Foundation, speaking as
&gt;a panel member.  The ECPA protects transmitted data, but it also
&gt;needs to protect stored data, he said.  "A person's expectation of
&gt;privacy doesn't end when they store something on a hard disk."
&gt; 
&gt;But Walker brushed Godwin aside saying, "It's easy to get caught up
&gt;in the rhetoric that privacy is the end all be all."
&gt; 
&gt;Do you have an expectation of privacy for things you store on your
&gt;hard disk, in your own home?  Walker says that idea is up for
&gt;debate:  "Part of this working group is to establish what is a
&gt;reasonable expectation of privacy."
&gt; 
&gt;That's right.  Toss everything you know or thought you knew about
&gt;privacy out the fucking window, as you cruise down the fast lane of
&gt;the information superhighway.  Why?  Because for people like
&gt;Walker, those guardians of justice, "There has to be a balance
&gt;between privacy needs and law enforcement needs to catch
&gt;criminals," he says.
&gt; 
&gt;Balance, yes.  Total abrogation of my rights?  Fat chance.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;Meeks out...
&gt;
