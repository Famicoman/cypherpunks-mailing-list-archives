Dear Mr. Knight,

I am not interested in "tearing apart" anything, I was just participating 
in a discussion. Ad hominem attacks are really unjustified. Even though 
you have a hard time understanding my arguments, I have refrained from 
calling you stupid, until now. You are not only stupid, but silly. "I'm 
glad your're not a politician" is a non-sequitur, and is certainly 
irrelevant to the discussion. Further, this whole discussion is entirely 
"academic", since there is absolutely no case law on this particular 
subject. So if you are so excited about it, collect your pennies and hire 
an attorney to enforce your copyright, I'm sure my brethern could use the 
business.

&gt; &gt; Regarding the archive I believe it was some company in Canada, I'm not 
&gt; &gt; sure. There was a thread about this archiving question on another group I 
&gt; &gt; suppose in the last three weeks. I can't remember where I saw it, if it 
&gt; &gt; wasn't here. Sorry. And about "paying" for the cd-rom, I pay for the 
&gt; &gt; usenet feed, and none of us who post are getting royalty payments from 
&gt; &gt; any of the internet providers. So answer the question again, what is the 
&gt; &gt; difference in paying an internet provider for access to usenet, and 
&gt; &gt; paying a cd-rom provider for access to usenet? None materially, except 
&gt; &gt; that the cd is not interactive, and some providers are (not all as in 
&gt; &gt; bbs' that don't send e-mail to the internet, but have some usenet 
&gt; &gt; groups.) There is no material difference that I can determine.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just glad you are not a politician.
&gt; 
&gt; If all you are concerned with is "Material differnce", then you think 
&gt; it's perfectly ok for me to sell you a good copy of a magazine?  By your 
&gt; "logic" (loosely used), you had to pay for the copy, and you had to pay 
&gt; for the original, so what's the difference?  The difference is the WILL 
&gt; AND PERMISSION of the author!  As the author of this message, I willingly 
&gt; placed it within the net.  I HAVE NOT, NOR WILL NOT, GIVE FREE PERMISSION 
&gt; TO A CD-ROM PUBLISHING HOUSE TO PUBLISH MY WORK.
&gt; 
&gt; The basis of copyright law is the protection of the author's rights.  One 
&gt; of these rights is the choice of distribution.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you should try writing for money sometime.  You might actually 
&gt; appreciate what you seem to be trying to tear apart.
