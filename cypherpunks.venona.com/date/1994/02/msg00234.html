&gt; From: CCVARGA@delphi.com
&gt; 
&gt; GENTLEMEN,  MOST OF MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ON THE NET HAVE BEEN BOTH
&gt; WELL THOUGHT AND INTELLECTUALLY "NON'TRIVIAL".  THE REMAILING OF 
&gt; MULTIPLE COPIES OF HIGH NOISE INFORMATION DRIBBLE WOULD CAUSE ME TO 
&gt; LOOK AT THE TRAFFIC ON THE NET AND AS : IS IT WORTH IT?
&gt; RIGHT NOW, THE NUMBER OF UNSUBSCRIBE MESSAGES LEADS ME TO BELIEVE 
&gt; THAT IT IS NOT.  IF THIS IS WHAT TOAD WANTS, SO BE IT. IF THERE IS 
&gt; AN INDIVIDUAL AMONG YOU THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CASE FOR 
&gt; CONTINUED SUBSCRIPTION, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE SERIOUS REPLY'S.
&gt; CCVARGA@DELPHI.COM

So--another noisemaker complaining about noise on the list.  Why don't
you decide for yourself whether it's worth continuing your subscription?
Would you actually base your decision on the number of people who
tell you that it's worth continuing?  If you're new to the list, why
don't you stick around for a while and see what you think?  If not,
you're probably fully capable of deciding for yourself now whether this
is the place for you.

Related issue: The number of people unsubscribing because of excessive
noise who are so rude and clueless as to post their unsubscribe requests
to the entire list (thereby increasing noise) is really getting to me.
Almost no tangential or "off-topic" thread pollutes this list as much as
unsubscribe requests that everyone has to read.  The cypherpunks welcome
message clearly states that unsubscribe messages should be sent to
cypherpunks-request@toad.com.  Simple.  Again, the list administrator is
a human being, not a machine, so those requests may take a couple of days
to process.  Big deal.  Losing your patience and whining to the list is
as useful as pushing the elevator call button a hundred times, and has the
added disadvantage of getting hundreds of people really angry.  It also
makes you look like a clueless newbie.

I usually send these messages to individuals, not the whole list, but it
seems that there's been an increase in unsubs sent to all of us.

Again, folks, if you want to unsubscribe (which I'm not encouraging you
to do), it's

cypherpunks-request@toad.com

   --Dave.
