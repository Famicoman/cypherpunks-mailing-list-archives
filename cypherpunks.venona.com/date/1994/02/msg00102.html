This may not be elegant, but it works well in my account. It checks
the entire Cypherpunk remailer network connections and is user friendly.

#!/usr/bin/perl
# Change this to reflect where your system has perl.

# SuperPing version 1.2: Ping Cyperpunk remailer connections.
# Now pings in both directions, as I have learned they are NOT equivalent.
# Brought to you by Xenon &lt;na38138@anon.penet.fi&gt;.
# Thanks to Alan Barrett for teaching me some perl.

# Warning: outputs ~40 e-mails at a time. May give "too many processes"
# error towards the end if you haven't killed all of your stopped jobs.
# Increase the sleep(sec) time if needed. 

# Be careful. If mail bounces between any two remailers in either
# direction, "Mr. Remailer Operator" will obtain a full mailbox! 

# To test the program, comment out all the remailers in the list and add
# YOUR address at least three times to the list of "remailers".

# You MUST make a file called .PingFile that contains:
#::
#Request-Remailing-To: your.address
#
#Ping!
#
#-----Begin Test-----
#Test
#-----End Test-----

# Will also function as a convenient method to shut down all remailers at
# once by making .PingFile 500K instead of 1K. Not recommended if you
# value your life ;-). 

# List of remailers (not complete). Make any line a comment to remove that
# line's remailer. cicada and pmantis are not meant for heavy traffic so I
# have removed them. Soda is commented for no particular reason.

#Nicknames for output and subject lines.

# Select a marking character for this SuperPing session.
@Mark = ("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O",

srand(time);
$M = $Mark[rand(26)];

# Strings, since lines got too long below.
# Obviously this could be written better using sendmail but I'm writing
# perl code without KNOWING any perl.

  $A = "(echo \"::\" ; echo \"Request-Remailing-To: ";
  $B = " ; echo \"\" ; cat .PingFile) | mail -s \"$M.";

# Send a "Ping!" between all combinations of two remailers, in both
# directions. $Num is a count that ends up in the Subject line. Each number
# is used twice, with a &lt; and &gt; telling which direction the mail went. Change
# "system" to "print" to see the Unix commands being produced. 

foreach $Sec (0..$#Rm) {
    foreach $First ($Sec+1..$#Rm) {
     $Num++ ;

     $C = " $Nick[$First] &gt; $Nick[$Sec]\" " ;
     system "$A$Rm[$Sec]\"$B$Num$C$Rm[$First]";
     print "$M.$Num $Nick[$First] &gt; $Nick[$Sec]\n";
     sleep(1) ;
 
     $C = " $Nick[$First] &lt; $Nick[$Sec]\" " ;
     system "$A$Rm[$First]\"$B$Num$C$Rm[$Sec]";
     print "$M.$Num $Nick[$First] &lt; $Nick[$Sec]\n";
     sleep(1) ;
   }
}


# Output (with only catalyst, qwerty and rosebud checked) looks like this:

# S.1 qwerty &gt; catalyst
# S.1 qwerty &lt; catalyst
# S.2 rosebud &gt; catalyst
# S.2 rosebud &lt; catalyst
# S.3 rosebud &gt; qwerty
# S.3 rosebud &lt; qwerty

# These are printed out as the program progresses and they also appear as
# the Subject of each piece of mail.

# alias g '(grep Subject: /usr/spool/mail/n/name | sort -t. +1 -n) | more'
# will make the command "g" give a list of received pings, in order. /n/name
# is your part of the mail spool. You should also check that the received
# pings really came from the second remailer instead of getting short
# circuited by the first remailer.

# Sample output mail as received by a remailer:
# 
#From: Your name &lt;your.address&gt;
#Message-Id: &lt;numbers@your.site&gt;
#To: qwerty@netcom.com
#Subject: S.1 qwerty &gt; catalyst
#Status: R
#
#::
#Request-Remailing-To: catalyst@netcom.com
#
#::
#Request-Remailing-To: your.address
#
#Ping!
#
#-----Begin Test-----
#Test
#-----End Test-----
