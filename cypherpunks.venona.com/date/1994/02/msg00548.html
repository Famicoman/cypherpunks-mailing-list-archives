An interesting article in the London Daily Telegraph (today's?):

Neo-Nazis Salute Computer Technology
 
Computer technology is transforming Germany's disparate neo-Nazi scene 
into a unified movement by granting instant access to a central 
information system co-ordinating demonstrations and disseminating 
propaganda, according to a senior intelligence official.
 
Herr Ernst Uhrlau, head of Hamburg's office for the protection of the
constitution, said:  "German's RIght wing is taking up the character of a
movement.
 
Until now, we have only seen this in the Left wing, but the various
Righ-wing groups, who all yearn for hierarchy and leadership, are using
modern communications systems such as computers, mail boxes and 
information telephones to co-ordinate their activities."
 
Herr Uhrlau, whose office gathers intelligence on activities likely to
undermine state security, said that it was only by using mobile
communications networks that the Right wing was able to hold illegal 
rallies in 1992 and 1993 on the anniversary of the death of Rudolf Hess, 
Hitler's deputy.
 
He was also concerned about the infiltration of univeristy student
fraternities by Right-wing ideologues who were spreading their views
through notice boards, pamphlets, and newspapers.
 
The chief co-ordinators of German's Right-wing movement work through a
national computer network named "Thule", after the small elite 1920s
movement which preceded the Nazi party.
 
It consists of at least 12 "mailbox" computer lines linked to a national
network on which individuals can exchange messages and receive 
information.  The system is designed to be accessed only by bona fide 
political sympathisers.
 
To join the inner circle, you much leave your name, telephone number and
address, according to the monthly computer magazine Chip, which has
pentrated the Thule network.
 
Only if you pass a loyalty test while being questioned on the phone will 
you be given the full access codes.
 
Chip belives that 1,500 of Germany's 42,000 Righ-wing extremists use the
Thule network which, apart from co-ordinating demonstrations, gives out
information on such matters as how to start your own newspapers or make a
bomb [Both equally illegal activities in the BRD -- Editor's note].
 
Police have so far found it impossible to discover who is running any of 
the notice boards, since much of the information is only available for a 
brief period and suppliers use pseudonyms.
 
Thule also provides an international link.
 
Of particular concern to the authorities are connections with Gary Lauck,
self-proclaimed head of America's neo-Nazis, whose organisation in 
Nebraska is believed to be behind the mailing of a computer disk called 
"Endsieg" (Final Victory) which contains bomb-making instructions.
