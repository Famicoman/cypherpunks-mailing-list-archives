It's half done :-) ! Unfortunately the NSA run remailers haven't been
handing out info, but this should help people know which blanks are still
blanks ;-). God I hate these little sideways smileys!

Subj: Strips Subject header?
NL: Non-linear remailing? 123-&gt;231.
RD: Random delay added (max, in hours)?
Batch: Batched remailing? t2 means twice daily. n5 means after 5 messages.
CPU: Pr = private. PA = account on public access machine. Un = university.
Phys: Physical security of the CPU, especially at night. H/M/L.
BitB: BitBucket feature?

Fast?:
++ &lt;5 min
+   5-10 min.
-  ~10-30 min delay
--  Pinging isn't practical due to long delays. Probably reliable though.
+/- Sometimes +, sometimes -.
Normal internet mail delays are common, and are not equivalent in the two
directions between any two remailers. Mail still gets through.

OpLog:
F: full copies of all mail is archived. My large volume mailing should
   help put a stop to this.
St: Stats logs of when mail was remailed.
St+: Stats logs of when and where mail was remailed.
St-: simple counter.
N: operator keeps no logs.
C: Simple counter.

SysLog:
SM: sendmail logs of when and where mail was exchanged. Root access needed.
MQ: mailqueue accessible by anyone on the site. Could make logs.

I have chosen nicknames based on a string common to both the outgoing
address and to the address you see on an incoming message from the remailer.

Software: The usual, tweaked for MMDF. Hal's.
Security: jarthur keeps sendmail logs.
Comments: Although jarthur doesn't batch, its connection often results in
          outgoing mail getting batched out anyway (1-3 hours delay).
History: Set up late '92.  PGP added mid '93.

menudo:
Run by Karl Barrus.
Machine: University machine.
Problems policy: see policy at gopher site. Contact klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu
                 or elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu.
Software: Modified Hal's.
Security: Stores messages and sends them out randomly at midnight.
          Pads messages to 1K with random stuff. (?)
Comments: elee9sf@menudo accepts RIPEM encryption.
          elee6ue@rosebud requires "digital cash" (basically random
          strings I made).
          Errors on elee9sf@menudo are forwarded klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu
          where they are deleted.  I still get mail at that address which is
          why I have it forwarded and not just dropped.

penet.fi:
Run by Julf (Johan Helsingus).
Machine: ?? Operator owned.
Problems policy: Account revokation. Contact ??@anon.penet.fi.
Software: custom.
Security:
Comments: By far the most popular remailer, dwarfing in a day what the
          entire Cypherpunk remailers combined carry in a month. Supports
          easy return addresses as well as non-anonymous mailing to
          someone's anonymous address (na1234... instead of an1234...).
          Your real address is kept on Julf's hard disk, but is fairly safe
          there, especially if you do not abuse your anonymity to harass
          someone. On a bad day your mail and especially Usenet posts may
          be delayed up to a day. Very reliable though. Sends error
          messages back to you for failed mail. Limited to 48K mail.

          Operator often logs in using telnet.
Comments: You must use na1234@anon.penet.fi not an1234@anon.penet.fi.
          Finger qwerty@netcom.com for a blurb on the remailer and updates
          on its software.
          Request-Remailing-To: /dev/null is a bit bucket.
          whitehouse.gov gets blocked and fully logged.
History: Up 2/94. Set up by Xenon who needed more remailers to use to send
         PGP info to people with, since anon.penet.fi was overloaded.
