&gt; "Detweiler can't live" and "Detweiler can't live IN MY
&gt; LIVING ROOM". Its the difference between saying "I
&gt; advocate the right of people to discuss any topic they
&gt; want" and saying "I adovacate the right of people to
&gt; discuss any topic they want IN MY BEDROOM AT FOUR AM WHILE
&gt; I'M TRYING TO SLEEP."

I've seen this analogy before and I think it is a poor analogy and  
should not be used.  I don't mean for this to be a flame, just a  
comment.  The problem with this analogy is that you are comparing a  
publicly available service that is being abused with a private  
residence that is being abused.

It is the difference between "Everybody can use this remailer except  
Detweiler" and "Nobody is allowed to shout in my bedroom at 4 AM, and  
that includes Detweiler".  Do you see the difference.  The analogy is  
comparing a service with a non-service.

Since remailers are services, the analogies used to discuss them  
should compare remailers with other services.  For example:

"Detweiler is a disruptive client and I am within my rights to  
prevent him from using my service."

Right now, remailer services are free, and that generates the  
impression in some that they are public resources that *must* be  
available to all.  If remailers charged even a small amount for their  
service, it might make it easier to justify denying service to  
specific individuals.  It's not logical, but people are seldom  
persuaded by logic alone.


&gt; I see nothing wrong with remailer operators taking steps
&gt; to prevent Detweiler from using their equipment against
&gt; their will. This is not censorship. Mr. Detweiler is
&gt; still free to use Usenet any way he sees fit. It is simp
y
&gt; the act of saying "Mr. Detweiler can't use MY REMAILER any
&gt; way he sees fit."
&gt; 

&gt;  Perry  

&gt; 


&gt;From this I can see that you agree that remailer operators should be  
able to refuse specific users, when possible.  My point with this  
post is to recommend abandoning the "bedroom" analogy.
