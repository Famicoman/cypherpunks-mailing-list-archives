AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF ENCRYPTION KEY COMPONENTS    
     IN CONJUNCTION WITH INTERCEPTS PURSUANT TO TITLE III

The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed key 
components in conjunction with lawfully authorized interception of 
communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method. 
These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conducted 
pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus crime Control and Safe 
Streets Act of 1968, as amended (Title III), Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 2510 et seq.

	1) In each case there shall be a legal authorization for the 
interception of wire and/or electronic communications.

	2) All electronic surveillance court orders under Title III 
shall contain provisions authorizing after-the-fact minimization, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2518(5), permitting the interception and 
retention of coded communications, including encrypted 
communications.

	3) In the event that federal law enforcement agents discover 
during the course of any lawfully authorized interception that 
communications encrypted with a key escrow encryption method are 
being utilized, they may obtain a certification from the 
investigative agency conducting the investigation, or the Attorney 
General of the United States or designee thereof. Such 
certification shall

		(a) identify the law enforcement agency or other 
authority conducting the interception and the person providing the 
certification; 

		(b) certify that necessary legal authorization has been 
obtained to conduct electronic surveillance regarding these 
communications; 

		(c) specify the termination date of the period for which 
interception has been authorized; 

		(d) identify by docket number or other suitable method 
of specification the source of the authorization;

		(e) certify that communications covered by that 
authorization are being encrypted with a key-escrow encryption 
method;

		(f) specify the identifier (ID) number of the key escrow 
encryption chip providing such encryption; and

		(g) specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrow 
decryption device that will be used by the law enforcement agency 
or other authority for decryption of the intercepted 
communications.

	4) The agency conducting the interception shall submit this 
certification to each of the designated key component escrow 
agents. If the certification has been provided by an investigative 
agency, as soon thereafter as practicable, an attorney associated 
with the United States Attorney's Office supervising the 
investigation shall provide each of the key component escrow 
agents with written confirmation of the certification.

	5) Upon receiving the certification from the requesting 
investigative agency, each key component escrow agent shall 
release the necessary key component to the requesting agency. The 
key components shall be provided in a manner that assures they 
cannot be used other than in conjunction with the lawfully 
authorized electronic surveillance for which they were requested.

	6) Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain a 
copy of the certification of the requesting agency, as well as the 
subsequent confirmation of the United States Attorney's Office. In 
addition, the requesting agency shall retain a copy of the 
certification and provide copies to the following for retention in 
accordance with normal record keeping requirements:

		(a) the United States Attorney's Office supervising the 
investigation, and
		
		(b) the Department of Justice, Office of Enforcement 
Operations.

	7) Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronic 
surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of the 
requesting agency to decrypt intercepted communications shall 
terminate, and the requesting agency may not retain the key 
components.

	8) The Department of Justice shall, in each such case,

		(a) ascertain the existence of authorizations for 
electronic surveillance in cases for which escrowed key components 
have been released;

		(b) ascertain that key components for a particular key 
escrow encryption chip are being used only by an investigative 
agency authorized to conduct electronic surveillance of 
communications encrypted with that chip; and 

		(c) ascertain that, no later than the completion of the 
electronic surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of 
the requesting agency to decrypt intercepted communications is 
terminated.

	9) In reporting to the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2519(2), the Assistant 
Attorney General for the Criminal Division shall, with respect to 
any order for authorized electronic surveillance for which 
escrowed encryption components were released and used for 
decryption, specifically note that fact.

These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create, 
any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through 
electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures 
shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other 
objection to the introduction of electronic surveillance evidence 
lawfully acquired.
