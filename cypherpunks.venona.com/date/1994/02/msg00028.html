&gt; Jim -
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Where is this agreement that it is ok to distribute material through a 'stor
e-
&gt; &gt;and-forward' network stated in the copyright law? I would be very interested

&gt; &gt;in the proviso that exempts such networks from liability.
&gt;
&gt; It's not embedded in the law; as I said, it's an implicit permission I grant
&gt; when I post a message to such a network. Just as, when you buy a program on
&gt; a floppy disk, you are implicitly granted the right to copy it from the disk
&gt; into your computer's memory in order to run it: the nature of the work
&gt; requires that specific type of copying. There's nothing new there.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The bottem line is that when I got my feed I was not asked to sign any kinjd

&gt; &gt;of waiver releasing any material that I generate from copyright infringement

&gt; &gt;as long as it was on a hard drive (or any other media). I did not sign any
&gt; &gt;kind of contract at all as a matter of fact. Legaly I still retain my right
&gt; &gt;of copyright on every bit on every drive (whether magnetic or otherwise) in
&gt; &gt;the internet and even your personal drive if you transfer the mail and other

&gt; &gt;material to it for offline processing.
&gt;
&gt; One more time. The nature of the work and your chosen distribution medium
&gt; (netnews) requires a variety of copying for it to work: store-and-forward
&gt; for propagation, copying into the memory of my system and onto my screen so
&gt; I can read it. You grant permission to do that implicitly when you make the
&gt; work available by that mechanism.
&gt;
&gt; Once I have received the copy you have implicitly authorized me to have,
&gt; what I can *do* with that copy is governed by the Copyright Act and its fair
&gt; use exemptions. I can use it for purposes of scholarship (i.e. I can keep it
&gt; in an online or paper folder and refer to it later) and I can excerpt pieces
&gt; for critique, among other things.  What I *cannot* do is redistribute it by
&gt; any other mechanisms and for any purpose other than your initial netnews
&gt; distribution.
&gt;
&gt; I have spent a lot of time studying this part of the law. Really. I already
&gt; heeded my glib advice about reading the damn copyright act. Have you?
&gt;
&gt; Jason
&gt;

when I buy a software program the copyright notice specificaly states that I
am allowed to make copies for backup purposes. Some of them notices on high-
dollar packages even tell me how many I can keep and whether I can keep them
on a network or not.
