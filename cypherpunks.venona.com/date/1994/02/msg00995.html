Subject: GTE High Technology in California


The following bulletin was released by GTE on Monday.
 
Feb. 14, 1994
  
       GTE BRINGS HIGHLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO CALIFORNIA
           THIS WEEK; "WORLD CLASS NETWORK" A REALITY
 
 
GTE California today announced that it will install highly advanced
switching technology this week in the Los Angeles area as part of the
company's continuing effort to build a "World Class Network" for
customers.
 
The company said ATM switches -- some of the final components that
permit access to the information superhighway -- will be installed
Tuesday (Feb. 15) at company facilities in Santa Monica, Ontario and
Thousand Oaks. Additional ATM switches are scheduled to be installed
at other California sites before the end of the year.
 
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switches handle simultaneous video,
data, image and voice traffic.  A few of the customer service
capabilities include: interactive distance learning among classrooms
in different parts of a city or state; geographically distant
employees sharing documents and images during video conference calls;
medical experts in separate hospitals concurrently reviewing and
diagnosing X-rays; and residential customers picking movies from
video-on-demand libraries.
 
GTE's ATM network initially will support educational institutions,
businesses and government agencies.
 
"The 1990s have been a challenging time for California, but also an
exciting time as we work to build a future that's better than our
past," said West Area President Larry Sparrow. "We've been
aggressively installing advanced network systems here for several
years. The addition of ATM switching makes our long-standing vision of
a World Class Network a reality."
 
ATM SWITCHES PART OF GTE PLAN TO SUPPORT EDUCATION
 
Educational institutions are a critical component of GTE's World Class
Network in California. More details of the World Class Network's
educational aspects, as well as business and government applications,
will be announced at a later date.
 
"We've proven the value of telecommunications in the classroom, and
we've learned that no single product can meet the diversity of needs
present in our schools today. Another difficulty educators face is
technological obsolescence," Sparrow said. "GTE will ensure that
educators have access to technology that meets their individual needs.
ATM's flexibility will help schools avoid dependency on technology
that will become outdated."
 
Using telecommunications, schools can improve the quality of education
by pooling resources and accessing a tremendous variety of information
and learning materials.
 
The company has conducted several educational pilot projects,
including programs in the Hacienda-La Puente and Norwalk-La Mirada
school districts, and a distance learning program with California
State University, Dominguez Hills and Coastline Community College.
GTE also has conducted the world's most comprehensive technology test
of educational applications as part of the company's Cerritos Project.

In only two weeks, over 10,000 users of the nation's computer networks
have signed the CPSR petition calling for President Clinton to
withdraw the Clipper proposal.

Opposition has been widespread, from CEOs of large firms to college
students in small towns, from librarians and civil libertarians to
computer programmers and product marketers.

To sign the petition, email &lt;clipper.petition@cpsr.org&gt; with the
message "I Oppose Clipper"

Subject: More FTP NISDN Information Available
Date: 15 Feb 1994 13:55:41 -0500
Organization: Bell Communications Research (Bellcore)


Information about National ISDN is now available by anonymous FTP
(File Transfer Protocol) over the Internet at host: info.bellcore.com

FTP allows the retrieval of formatted documents and software.

The documentation now available (2/17/94) includes:

1. A Catalog of National ISDN Solutions for Selected 
   NIUF Applications
2. Bellcore document, SR-2006, "National ISDN"
3. A list of Bellcore TEC training for National ISDN

Additional documentation will be added over time and this announcement
will be periodically updated and posted to the appropriate newsgroups.

The files are available in PostScript through anonymous FTP from
"info.bellcore.com" in the /pub/ISDN sub directory.

I M P O R T A N T: Many of the files are large, it is essential that
you first get the README (the upper case is important) file for
detailed information on retrieving various files associated with
documents.

The following text describes a typical anonymous FTP session:

   system: ftp info.bellcore.com &lt;enter&gt;
   Connected to info.
   220 info FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready.
   Name: anonymous &lt;enter&gt;
   331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
   Password: &lt;enter your internet login -- example: 
                    student@university.edu&gt;
   230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
   ftp&gt; cd /pub/ISDN &lt;enter&gt;
   250 CWD command successful.
   ftp&gt; mget README &lt;enter&gt;
   mget README? yes &lt;enter&gt;
   200 PORT command successful.
   150 ASCII data connection for README (8758 bytes).
   226 ASCII Transfer complete.
   local: README remote: README
   8943 bytes received in 0.19 seconds (46 Kbytes/s)
   ftp&gt; quit &lt;enter&gt;
   221 Goodbye.

&lt;enter&gt; represents pressing the "enter" or "return" key on your
computer keyboard.

The README file is in ASCII format and may be read on any word
processor. The other files in the directory are in PostScript format
and may be downloaded as needed by using the "mget" command while in
the FTP.

The PostScript files may be printed on a PostScript printer by using
the "lprr" command. A typical Post Script print command may look like:

           lpr -P&lt;printer&gt; -h -v &lt;filename.ps&gt;

where:

&lt;printer&gt; represents printer name on your network, and &lt;filename.ps&gt;
represents a PostScript file.

'-h' corresponds to the option of suppressing the printing of burst
page while '-v' corresponds to the option of printing raster image,
i.e., PostScript. Please note that the printer must support PostScript
imaging model in order to print these files.

Subject: Caller ID in Russia (For Curious)
Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)
Date: Tue, 15 Feb 1994 03:52:45 GMT


After some reading of 'Caller ID' thread, I decided that some curious
people might be interested how is it done in Russia.  Russia is
beginning to offer tone-dialing (very limited number of exchanges even
in Moscow), but as long-distance direct dialing is very common,
standard (?) caller ID request/responce are used.  It is worth to
mention that in Russia all seven-digit calls are local (flat rate), so
the problems with billing only begin when you call 8 (wait for
dialtone) (area code) number.  Your caller ID is requested after you
dialed 8.  If it failed after several trials or callback probe
realized that the number is not busy (i.e. it is forged or incorrectly
recognized), you get engaged tone and need to hang up.  (International
calling is 8 W 10 + ....; this 10 looks more familiar, eh?).  

Of course, there is nothing like custom calling services.  (You cannot
_dial_ * or #, can you?)  That's why hardware-knowledgeable people
began to create their own devices (mostly Z80-based, with 4K of ROM)
to perform basic caller ID functions. Algorithms were getting better
and better, and now such a device does caller ID (buffer for about 10,
time and date), white (distinctive ringing), grey (regular) and black
(rejected) lists of caller IDs, repetitive dialing, "answering
machine" (outgoing message from RAM, incoming to an attached tape
recorder), etc., etc. Very impressive, especially for those who
understand that there is 1-bit FFT inside.  What happened next -- it
became almost impossible to call long distance, because the number of
caller-ID generators was limited and if all of them on your local
exchange are busy when you call long distance, it doesn't get your ID
and rejects you. That's why the Ministry of Communications decided to
introduce the fee for caller ID boxes.  

But it is not the end of the story. As those boxes are cheaper than
answering machines, people used them in AM mode when leaving home,
that is when you call a number equipped with caller-ID box, it picks
up after the first ring, sends the request, decides what to do with
you, and either simulates busy tone or hangs up (you're rejected) or
simulates ringing and really rings the phone, but nobody answers.  It
is very annoying if you call from a payphone, that's why it is
considered very impolite to set the device in AM mode. (regular mode
is to detect ID after the receiver went off hook).  Of course,
anti-caller-ID were developed, but they work quite unreliably -- just
trying to send pulses after remote picked up. Sometimes it helps,
sometimes not.  Last note: as the system was designed for billing, the
ID only contains seven digits, so it is impossible to derive area code
from ID, the best is to recognize "alien" phone number.

I hope it was of interest,


Leo


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Yes Leo, it was of interest. Thanks very

Subject: Cell Phone Welcome Message
Organization: Nyx, Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math/CS dept.
Date: Tue, 15 Feb 94 14:02:47 GMT


My in-laws have a new Motorola flip phone that they love very much.
They recently took a trip to Florida and while driving on Rt. 95 the
phone rang and they got some sort of a "welcome" message from one of
the local service providers.  My FIL is constantly amazed by all the
technology at work here and he would like to know basically how this
works.

I assumed that the phone, while in standby, can detect when it enters
and leaves each cell.  And when it sees that it enters the cell of a
new carrier it (the phone) transmits some sort of a "here I am"
message obviously this includes his phone number or some sort of
serial number so that the cell can call back with the "welcome" msg.

Is this about right?


Thanks,

Reply-To: davel@to.mobil.com (Dave Linthicum)


A question: If network efficiency can be roughly estimated using the
following formula:

E = M/(M+O)

where:

M = Message size
O = Overhead needed to send one message
  = (Px delay x speed) + ACK size + H
P = NUMBER OF PACKETS SENT
H = HEADER SIZE 
ACK = Acknowlegment message of meassage received

For example, IEEE 802.3 uses this formula such as:

E = 100/(100 + 30 + 64 + 2(64) = 31%

I know 100 is Message size. What is 30, 64, and 2(64)?  This is in a
network modeling book.

Please respond via e-mail.  Thanks!

Subject: Request For Map Drawing Software


        I'm getting into software that draws network maps on the fly
as people use it, with need to zoom in and out and place variable
labels, like node names, on the maps, and have them ultimately
printable on an attached printer or fileable in disk files.

        Can anyone suggest sources for some nice geographic outline
map drawing code for PCs?  The U.S., Canada, and world political
outline maps are all ultimately needed.  Windows/DOS preferred, but
UNIX is acceptable, at least to try with.  Ultimately, I will need to
get the source to make modifications as to labeling and such.
Commercial products are acceptable, but public domain is preferred.
The choice depends on cost.

Given the extended range folks are reporting for these new phones, it
seems like privacy is an even bigger issue.  Do the units provide any
sort of build in key to distinguish your phone from your neighboors?
(not that such would prevent determined eavsdropping, but it would
keep the other guys phone and likely the scanner-heads out).

Hi, I hope someone out there can help ...

I've acquired a touchtone phone but the wires leading from the headset
to the phone AND the wires leading from the phone to the jack are not
connected.  Here is all the numbers I could find on the phone: on the
cover at back it is placo telecom inc.  On the inside on the touch pad
is says NE-35Q3A2X  1-79

on the bottom of the phone there is a number:
   79
  QSQM
 2500AX

on the inside of the phone on the right is a block where the wires
should be connected (I think) the block is labled: L1 L2 G X Y.

The wires that come from the hand set (four) are black, red and two
whites, from the phone jack (four) are black, green, red and yellow.

I would like to get this phone working, any help would be appreciated.


Thanks,

Rob
