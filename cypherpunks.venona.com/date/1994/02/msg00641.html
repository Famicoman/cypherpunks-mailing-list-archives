    I got this recently, but hesitated to post, after previously
    being told by folks on the hardware list "thats too much".
    Perhaps not, compared to the RNG-810 that Paul Elliot spoke of.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hardware Random Number Generator
&gt; 
&gt; Random Number Generator
&gt; Excerpt from the USER MANUAL
&gt; 
&gt; How the RNG works
&gt; The Random Number Generator consists of two independent analogue 
&gt; Zener diode based noise sources. Both signals are converted into random bit 
&gt; streams, combined and subsequently transmitted in the form of bytes to the 
&gt; RS-232 port of your computer. Special timing circuits ensure that crucial 
&gt; logical operations occur at  moments that the device has stable signals.
&gt; The baud rate is 9600. So the device is capable of supplying you with about 
&gt; 960 random bytes or 7600 random bits per second
&gt; Power is drawn from the RTS and TXD signal. (pins 4 and 2 of the D-25 
&gt; connector). In order to work properly the RTS signal should be high (5 volts 
&gt; or higher) and one should not send bytes to the device!
&gt; 
&gt; WARNING: part of the RNG is shielded. It is not recommend to open the 
&gt; device. It is not allowed to copy or use the design of the RNG without 
&gt; written permission of the developer, the Foundation for Fundamental 
&gt; Research on Man and Matter (FREMM).
&gt; 
&gt; The testdata
&gt; Each RNG passes a 256 run randomness test before being shipped. Each run 
&gt; consists of 8192 samples. The unselected results of this test are included 
&gt; with the package. If at the end of the test runs the cumulative first order 
&gt; deviation is larger than 1.5 standard deviations the RNG is tested another 20 
&gt; times. If it is accepted after these 20 tests this will be indicated.
&gt; 
&gt; How to connect the RNG to the computer
&gt; The RNG is functionally similar to a 'crazy' modem producing random 
&gt; information to your machine. It should be connected like any modem. In 
&gt; some cases when the computer has a standard D-25 male connector you can 
&gt; plug the RNG directly into that connector. In other cases (e.g.. for Apple 
&gt; machines) you have to connect the RNG through a standard modem cable.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; SOFTWARE supplied on the disk
&gt; 
&gt; DOS 
&gt; 
&gt; The program RTEST  (for listing see appendix) takes two arguments.
&gt; 
&gt; RTEST &lt;port&gt; &lt;ncycles&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;port&gt; indicates which serial port is used (either 1 or 2. (default:2)).
&gt; &lt;ncycles&gt; gives the number of test runs. One test run consists of reading 
&gt; 26500 bytes and calculating the Chi-2 and the number of bits on each one of 
&gt; the eight positions within the byte. If more test runs are specified the 
&gt; numbers (except the chi-2) accumulate.
&gt; If the program is started it will display one sample from the specified port. 
&gt; More samples can be displayed by hitting the ENTER-key.
&gt; Continuous sampling of the test runs is started by the ESC key. The results 
&gt; will be available for further statistical analysis in the textfile 'TEST'.
&gt; 
&gt; The program RAND3 takes one argument.
&gt; 
&gt; RAND3 &lt;port&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This program starts in the same way as RTEST by displaying individual 
&gt; samples after each time the ENTER key is hit. . After hitting the ESC key 
&gt; continuous sampling starts and the bytes are displayed tin a graphical form 
&gt; in real time. The continuous samples can be restarted by hitting the space-
&gt; bar. Exit through the ESC key.
&gt; 
&gt; The software addresses the serial port directly. It is also possible to 
&gt; implement a driver which is interrupt driven (like the software supplied for 
&gt; the Mac).  A driver is available upon request and can also be obtained 
&gt; electronically from the FTPsite:
&gt; PSI_LINE.psy.uva.nl
&gt; in directory  GUESTS/RNG/SOFTWARE/DOS
&gt; In the near future this site will also offer PK-test programs.
&gt; 
&gt; Macintosh
&gt; 
&gt; The Macintosh software is based upon the standard serial port drivers rather 
&gt; than on direct access of the serial ports. The bufferspace for this driver 
&gt; should be large enough to hold incoming bytes while the driver is active and 
&gt; no reading occurs. In cases where this is not clear one should close the 
&gt; driver and reopen it when needed.
&gt; In the examples the modem-port is used. In the listings it is indicated how to 
&gt; use the printer-port. 
&gt; 
&gt; RNG_test
&gt; The program rng_test will  ask for the number of test runs to perform. Each 
&gt; test run consists of 8192 samples. The chi-2 (df=255) and the number of '1' 
&gt; bits minus the number of '0' bits on each of the positions within the byte are 
&gt; displayed after each run. Chance expectation is of course 0. When more runs 
&gt; are specified the cumulative number of '1' bits  minus the cumulative 
&gt; number of '0' bits are displayed as well as the  corresponding standard 
&gt; deviation.
&gt; All data are saved in the file RNGTESTDATA. Each run on a separate line 
&gt; and the data separated by spaces.
