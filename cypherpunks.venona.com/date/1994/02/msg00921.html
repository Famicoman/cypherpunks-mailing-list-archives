   I have an idea of how ambitious cypherpunks could make money. They
could be communications intermediaries between financial clients in
the U.S. &amp; financial institutions in locations such as the Bahamas
&amp; Switzerland.

   This would require a cypherpunk in the U.S. &amp; another cypherpunk
in the foreign country. From now on in text cypherpunk = CP.
The U.S. CP would get message from client &amp; then use the internet
with anonymous remailers &amp; strong encryption to send message to
CP in foreign country. CP in foreign country then decrypts message
&amp; gives it to local financial institution. Financial institution
gives message to foreign CP who then encrypts &amp; uses anonymous
remailers to send info. back to U.S. CP.    U.S. CP decrypts &amp; gives
info to client.  In this way, encryption naive client could have
access to great financial privacy &amp; CPs get money. At this point,
I think everybody gets the basic idea.

   CPs would have initial problem getting clients. To do this they would
need to hook up with a financially sophisticated partner. That shouldn't
be too hard. College friends in finance, local CPA's you've dealt with,th,
lawyers, etc..  CPs would probably be the rare &amp; precious birds. Once
the CP has his financial contact, that financial contact can develop
the clients.

   In the foreign country, the CP shouldn't have much of a problem
getting a financial partner/advisor &amp; could probably operate with
neon lights. In the land of the free (the U.S.), I would advise
discretion.

   This business should not take a lot of capital. CPs would bring the
rare communications technical expertise &amp; the financial expertise
should be plentiful. There is a possibility of harassment, so the
CP's should have courage.

   By the way, there was someone on CYPERPUNKS that was offering a
percentage of the profits for great financial ideas. I would
like to volunteer this idea. It might not meet all the specifications,
but then someone might like to change specifications &amp; accept this idea.

   This idea may be half baked. In which case, I leave it to my fellow
cypherpunk geniuses associates to fully bake it.
                             Good luck - Gary Jeffers
