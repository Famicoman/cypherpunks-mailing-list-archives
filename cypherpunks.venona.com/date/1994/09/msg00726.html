&gt; In general, scienter/mens rea requirements mean that you must have intended
&gt; a particular action (or failure to act) - the question is about your 
&gt; understanding of the facts of a particular situation, not the legal status
&gt; of a particular situation. Given your example, it's illegal to drive
&gt; across the border, knowing your pickup contains ammunition - whether or
&gt; not you believe your actions are legal. It's not illegal to drive across
&gt; the border with a box full of ammunition if you thought you were carrying
&gt; a box full of clothes.
&gt; 
&gt; The old saw "ignorance of the law is no excuse" is basically accurate.
&gt; Good-faith reliance on legal advice from competent counsel won't even
&gt; save you. (but it might get you a malpractice judgement/settlement). 

I don't know how true this is in general, but my research into the
arms export question indicated otherwise.  Here is part of a posting I
sent to CP some time last year concerning a case in which the defendant
did in fact drive to Mexico with a truck load of ammunition:

&gt; In U.S. v Lizarraga-Lizarraga, the appellate court wrote (in 541 F2d 826),
&gt; 
&gt; "At trial and on appeal, the defendant admits that he purchased the
&gt; ammunition and that he intended to export it to Mexico.  His defense is
&gt; bsed on the contention that he had no knowledge that his conduct violated
&gt; the law.  Hence, the appellant claims that to be found guilty under
&gt; 22 U.S.C. 1934 [the predecessor to 22 U.S.C. 2778], the government must
&gt; prove that he intended to violate the statute....  We agree, and hold
&gt; that he was entitled to a specific intent instruction.  Accordingly, we
&gt; reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial."
&gt; 
&gt; The court discusses several reasons for concluding that "willfully"
&gt; implies a need to show specific intent, among them that the articles on
&gt; the Munitions List are not obviously illegal to export, finally concluding:
&gt; 
&gt; "Accordingly, we hold that in order for a defendant to be found guilty of
&gt; exporting under 22 U.S.C. 1934, the government must prove that the
&gt; defendant voluntarily and intentionally violated a known legal duty not
&gt; to export the proscribed articles, and the jury should be so instructed."

Perhaps the arms export laws are worded differently than some others
and so the more stringent rules apply.
