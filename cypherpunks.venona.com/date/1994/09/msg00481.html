&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [NB: Followups redirected to alt.security.pgp]
&gt;  
&gt; This posting is a call for participation in a complete rehash of PGP to
&gt; parallel the existing PGP effort in the US.  All contributions are welcome,
&gt; although any cryptographic material from the US won't be usable by anyone else,
&gt; so it'd be best if all crypto work was done outside the US.  I believe Phil is
&gt; aware of this project but can't comment on it due to legal advice - please
&gt; don't pester him (or me) about this.
&gt;  
&gt; The following sections are a preliminary sketch of what's to be done, see the
&gt; end of this message for more information on how to participate.
&gt;  
&gt; Design goals for the new PGP:
&gt;  
&gt;   - Proper key database for fast lookup of keys.
&gt;   - Something like DER-encoded ASN.1 keys and data, PKCS/X.509 compatible with
&gt;     extensions for PGP's trust model and also i18n features not found in X.509
&gt;     (exact details still under debate).
&gt;   - Ability to plug in alternative routines, eg RSAREF instead of independant
&gt;     RSA code.
&gt;   - Backwards compatibility with 2.x.
&gt;   - MIME security extension compliant encoding of messages.
&gt;   - Flexible, planned message/key format which allows easy expandability.
&gt;  
&gt; The universal PGP rewrite emphasizes flexibility of design, modularity and
&gt; Chinese-wall seperation for ease of development, and abstraction of messy
&gt; details like low-level I/O.  Some rules to go by:
&gt;  
&gt; - All functional units are kept in seperate modules.  There is one header file
&gt;   giving the interface to that module.  Only the interface given in the header
&gt;   file is available to the outside world.  All non-public information should be
&gt;   in header files which are private to that module.  This should vastly simplfy
&gt;   development by multiple people since all the content-coupling of the existing
&gt;   code is eliminated.
&gt;  
&gt;   The whole of PGP is too big for one person to get an overview of, by
&gt;   enforcing modularity with a preset interface we can allow independant teams
&gt;   to work on the parts they're best at, as well as allow independant developers
&gt;   to user the libraries they want in PGP support software without having to
&gt;   worry about all the API's breaking every time there's a new release.
&gt;  
&gt; - None of the library routines perform any user I/O.  This is all handled by
&gt;   higher-level code, using callbacks if really necessary.  The libraries should
&gt;   be usable in any CLI or GUI environment without needing changes made for
&gt;   different operating environments.
&gt;  
&gt; - All routines return an integer status with well-defined codes.  Status values
&gt;   are defined in the module interface header and are of the form &lt;3-char module
&gt;   name&gt;ERR_&lt;error type&gt;, eg DBXERR_READ would indicate a read error in the
&gt;   database access code.  No mysterious constants buried seven nesting levesl
&gt;   down in routines somewhere!
&gt;  
&gt; The basic modules are:
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Streams
&gt; -------
&gt;  
&gt; A generalized stream I/O library.  A stream can be a block of memory, a FILE *,
&gt; a file-descriptor-based file, a TCP socket, an X.25 virtual circuit, or
&gt; whatever.  The use of memory streams does away with PGP2's overuse of temporary
&gt; files.
&gt;  
&gt;     int newStream( STREAM *stream );
&gt;     int attachStream( STREAM *stream, ??? );
&gt;     int ioctlStream( STREAM *stream, ??? );
&gt;     int readStream( STREAM *stream, void *buffer, size_t length );
&gt;     int writeStream( STREAM *stream, void *buffer, size_t length );
&gt;     int lengthStream( STREAM *stream );
&gt;     int deleteStream( STREAM *stream );
&gt;  
&gt; The attachStream() and ioctlStream() attach a stream to an interface, eg a
&gt; block of memory, a file, or a network connection, and change its
&gt; characteristics.  The end user is never aware of any difference, or of the fact
&gt; that, for example, for a small message they might be R/W memory, but for a
&gt; larger one they might be R/W a temporary file.  Perhaps an existing PD streams
&gt; library can be adapted to the task.
&gt;  
&gt; Error codes: STMERR_xxx
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; PKC
&gt; ---
&gt;  
&gt; A PKC library.
&gt;  
&gt;     int rsaEncrypt( PUBKEY *pubKey, STREAM *stream );
&gt;     int rsaDecrypt( PRIVKEY *privKey, STREAM *stream );
&gt;     int rsaKeyGen( ??? );
&gt;  
&gt; Error codes: PKCERR_xxx
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Crypto
&gt; ------
&gt;  
&gt; A conventional-key crypto library.
&gt;  
&gt;     int encrypt( CRYPTINFO *cryptInfo, STREAM *stream );
&gt;     int decrypt( CRYPTINFO *cryptInfo, STREAM *stream );
&gt;  
&gt; The CRYPTINFO struct contains all the information you need to specify
&gt; encryption algorithms and modes, so you'd have something like:
&gt;  
&gt;     cryptInfo-&gt;algorithm = CRYPT_ALGO_IDEA;
&gt;     cryptInfo-&gt;mode = CRYPT_MODE_CFB;
&gt;     encrypt( cryptInfo, stream );
&gt;  
&gt; This fixes another complaint with PGP, that for every job you do there are 15
&gt; different functions to do it, all with slightly different parameters and
&gt; options.  With the unified interface, the call to encrypt data is *always*
&gt; called encrypt() (rather than encryptIdeaCfb(), encryptFooBar(),
&gt; encryptThisThatAndTheOther(), etc), and the CRYPT_INFO struct contains all the
&gt; parameters you need.  A library could then implement a number of different
&gt; algorithms and you choose which one you want without having to know that the
&gt; function name for that option is encryptQwertyFoo().  You could even have a
&gt; getCryptInfo() call which queries a library as to which algorithms and modes it
&gt; implements, or the call could return CRYERR_ALGO_UNAVAIL (algorithm
&gt; unavailable) or CRYERR_MODE_UNAVAIL (encryption mode unavailable).
&gt;  
&gt; Error codes: CRYERR_xxx
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Configuration
&gt; -------------
&gt;  
&gt; Get configuration information for PGP routines.  Use a proper grammar
&gt; definition, perhaps lex+yacc (tcl has also been suggested), read into (private)
&gt; vars, make available to outside world via getXXX() calls.  NO GLOBAL CONFIG
&gt; VARS!
&gt;  
&gt;     int readConfigFiles( void );
&gt;     int getFooInfo( char *fooPtr );
&gt;     int getBarInfo( int *barPtr );
&gt;  
&gt; Error codes: CFGERR_xxx
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Random Number Handling
&gt; ----------------------
&gt;  
&gt; A random number management library.
&gt;  
&gt;     int openRandomStream( STREAM *stream );
&gt;     int readRandomStream( STREAM *stream, void *buffer, size_t count );
&gt;     int closeRandomStream( STREAM *stream );
&gt;  
&gt; This could use the existing keystroke latency method, or connect the stream to
&gt; custom hardware, or whatever.
&gt;  
&gt; Error codes: RNDERR_xxx
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Key Database Management
&gt; -----------------------
&gt;  
&gt; All keys can (and should be) stored in a database, which encapsulate the full
&gt; DER-encoded keys inside a database allowing fast lookup.  The general format
&gt; will be:
&gt;  
&gt;     { keyID, userID, encapsulated key }
&gt;  
&gt; The keyID is a hash of the key (making it independant of the key itself and not
&gt; prone to denial-of-service attacks), the userID is simply the user
&gt; ID/address/whatever, the encapsulated key contains the full key.  Lookup is
&gt; done on the keyID and userID which locate the required key.  Details of the
&gt; exact mechanism to be decided by the database experts - need to define message
&gt; format, kludges like storage of encapsulated keys in XMS for peecee's, etc etc.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; En/decoding
&gt; -----------
&gt;  
&gt; ASN.1 DER-encoding of keys/data, MIME en/decoding.  Needs to be discussed.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Compatibility
&gt; -------------
&gt;  
&gt; Backwards-compatibility code to handle old PGP keys and messages.   Presumably
&gt; keys will only need to be converted once, then we need to read old messages and
&gt; (possibly) write them.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Low-Level
&gt; ---------
&gt;  
&gt; Low-level OS interface code.  All OS-specific code is hidden in this module.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; I18n
&gt; ----
&gt;  
&gt; A proper i18n system which reads the appropriate messages from a database once
&gt; and then keeps them in memory.
&gt;  
&gt;     int readInternationalizationDatabase( void );
&gt;  
&gt; All user I/O then uses strings from the i18n database.  The database is
&gt; generated by a precompiler from some user-friendly input format, so that a
&gt; group of seperate language scripts for eg English, French, German, Russian, etc
&gt; are fed into one and, and the output is the full i18n database.  Adding a new
&gt; language to PGP then involves simply creating a new script in that language and
&gt; running the database compiler on it.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Installation
&gt; ------------
&gt;  
&gt; Not part of PGP, but we need someone to do a decent install script which
&gt; removes from end users the need to fiddle makefiles and options.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Others
&gt; ------
&gt;  
&gt; Other routines as required.  For example, we each library should have an init
&gt; call which registers an exit handler with a function called by atexit() to
&gt; allow a clean shutdown no matter how we exit the program.  This does away with
&gt; the current need for PGP to explicitly perform exit handling all over the
&gt; place, and hides the messy details from the end user (who may not even think
&gt; about things like this).
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; What we need:
&gt;  
&gt; - A well-connected site outside the US to run mailing lists, one per developers
&gt;   group:
&gt;  
&gt;     pgp-streams - streams interface for I/O
&gt;     pgp-crypto - public and private-key encryption, random number management
&gt;     pgp-dbx - key database management
&gt;     pgp-compat - PGP 2.x backwards-compatibility management
&gt;     pgp-protocol - PGP data/key format and protocol redesign
&gt;     pgp-lowlevel - low-level OS-specific glue code
&gt;     pgp-misc - everything else, eg config code, i18n, installation
&gt;  
&gt;   There may also be a need for a seperate group to handle key-related routines
&gt;   such as trust-level checks and whatnot, which is a fairly complex task.  The
&gt;   idea is to mimimze the amount of unnecessary traffic people will need to read
&gt;   in order to get their job done.
&gt;  
&gt;   The only communication which should be necessary between these groups is the
&gt;   header file which defines the data structures and interface and/or a written
&gt;   specification of the interface to a module.  This means that the PKC group
&gt;   can work on the PKC code without having to worry about what the streams,
&gt;   database, crypto, and os-specific groups are doing.
&gt;  
&gt;   An attached FTP site for distribution of code would also be nice.
&gt;  
&gt; - Groups of developers with expertise in PKC crypto, conventional crypto,
&gt;   database management, low-level OS-specific stuff, code optimization, protocol
&gt;   design, software i18n, and everything else imaginable.
&gt;  
&gt; Until the mailing lists are set up (someone volunteer a site, quickly!) I'll be
&gt; handling things in email, which means that it could take quite a while for me
&gt; to extract myself from the flood of messages I'm expecting.  Please try and
&gt; keep non-essential messages to a minimum, and be patient when waiting for
&gt; replies.
&gt;  
&gt; Peter (Hmm, maybe I'd better mount /usr/spool/mail on a seperate drive).
&gt;
