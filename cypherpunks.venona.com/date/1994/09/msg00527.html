           UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
              CONSTITUENT ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM

        We welcome your inquiry to the House of Representatives
Constituent Electronic Mail System.  Currently, fortythree Members of
the U.S. House of Representatives have been assigned public electronic
mailboxes that may be accessed by their constituents.  The nature and
character of the incoming electronic mail has demonstrated that this
capability will be an invaluable source of information on constituent
opinion.  We are now in the process of expanding the project to other
Members of Congress, as technical, budgetary and staffing constraints
allow.

        A number of House committees have also been assigned public
electronic mailboxes.  The names and electronic mailbox addresses of
these committees are listed below after the information about
participating Representatives.

        Please review the list of participating Representatives below,
and if the Congressional District in which you reside is listed, follow
the instructions below to begin communicating by electronic mail with
your Representative.  If your Representative is not yet on-line, please
be patient.

                    INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS

     The list above includes the electronic mail addresses of members
who are participating in the program.  However, if your Representative
is taking part in the project, we request that you send a letter or
postcard by U.S. Mail to that Representative at the address listed above
with your name and internet address, followed by your postal
(geographical) address. The primary goal of this program is to allow
Members to better serve their CONSTITUENTS, and this postal contact is
the only sure method currently available of verifying that a user is a
resident of a particular congressional district.

        In addition, constituents who communicate with their
Representative by electronic mail should be aware that Members will
sometimes respond to their messages by way of the U.S. Postal Service.
This  method of reply will help to ensure confidentiality, a concern
that is of upmost importance to the House of Representatives.
