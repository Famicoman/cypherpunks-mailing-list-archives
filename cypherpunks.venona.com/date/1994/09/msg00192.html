I found this in the eff group, and think it has some implications for
remailer operators and their logs. (That the FBI is subpoenaing e-mail
records is not news, but the connection to the Kevin Mitnick case is.)

Explanation: In an earlier message, Glen Roberts of "Full Disclosure"
gave his informed speculation that this subpoena has to do with the
FBI's search for uber-hacker Kevin Mitnick. The guy being subpoenaed
and monitored, Lewis De Payne, comments below.

The concern for remailer operators is that while I was reading this
saga, all I could think of was 'Why didn't they use remailers?" I
planned to comment on this in the public groups. (And I may still, if
somebody else doesn't beat me to it.)

But of course the concern is that if the FBI is going on a fishing
expedition (a legal term :-}) for e-mail records, and Netcom is
cooperating, then had they used remailers to communicate, we could now
be seeing subpoenas of *remailer logs*. (This will happen eventually.
All the more reasons for multiple national jurisdictions, for
destruction of logs, for bonding of remailers, and for "forward
secrecy" (a la Diffie-Hellman) to be implemented somehow.)

&gt; 
&gt; I will be sending you a story for Full Disclosure.  In it, I will discuss
&gt; how tech support at netcom told another party (whose name will remain
&gt; anonymous until I receive a subpoena) that the FBI was watching my acct,
&gt; and that they were served with an order.  This was disclosed to a
&gt; third-party by tech support!  I will also discuss my conversation with
&gt; the various people at netcom regarding this matter, as well as the
&gt; letter I sent to netcom explaining to them that their "monitoring" of
&gt; my account to conform with the _sealed_ court order was slowing me
&gt; down too much, and that if they didn't correct it, I might go find
&gt; another provider, and then they wouldn't be able to monitor me.
&gt; 
&gt; Lots more to come... in Full Disclosure Live.
