&gt;PRESS RELEASE
&gt;
&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE REALEASE  CONTACT: Charles N. Brownstein
&gt;September 12, 1994       703-620-8990
&gt;
&gt;MULTI-INDUSTRY COALITION SETS TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK
&gt;FOR THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Washington, D.C. -- Today, more than forty leading communications,
&gt;computing, and services companies proposed a consensus vision of the
&gt;architecture required for tomorrow's information superhighway. In addition,
&gt;the Cross-Industry Working Team (XIWT) members detailed an example of a key
&gt;component of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) - digital cash.
&gt;
&gt;The two white papers, 1) An Architectural Framework for the NII  and 2)
&gt;Digital Cash, Tokens and Payments in the NII, will be presented to the
&gt;President's NII Advisory Committee tomorrow at its meeting in New York.
&gt;
&gt;"These papers provide a technical vision and goals for the NII that cut
&gt;across a range of industries," said Robert Kahn, President of CNRI and
&gt;chair of the XIWT Executive Committee. "They provide a common foundation
&gt;for thinking about the objectives and technical requirements of the NII."
&gt;
&gt;In its Architecture paper, XIWT calls for an NII that promotes
&gt;interoperability and provides universal access, privacy, protection,
&gt;intellectual property, security, job creation and commerce in a competitive
&gt;business environment. Based on these objectives, XIWT defines the NII in
&gt;terms of a Functional Services Framework -- a model used to characterize
&gt;the NII by function and certain key characteristics.
&gt;
&gt;According to this model, the NII has three basic components: applications,
&gt;enabling services, and physical infrastructure. Together, these components
&gt;include all the NII's information and transporting machinery, the networked
&gt;software tools that facilitate manipulation and movement of digital
&gt;information, and the information processing activities of NII users.
&gt;
&gt;To meet the goals outlined for the NII, XIWT recommends that each of these
&gt;components be addressed in terms of functionality (what it does), trust
&gt;(the conditions under which it operates), and control (how it is managed).
&gt;
&gt;XIWT also provides a Reference Architecture Model for the NII -- a
&gt;description of the system in terms of the interconnection of the functional
&gt;elements of the system and the interfaces between them. XIWT identifies
&gt;four functional elements: 1) appliances: 2) networks; 3) resources; and 4)
&gt;control points. In addition, it identifies seven categories of interfaces
&gt;and protocols needed to integrate these elements and make them
&gt;interoperable.
&gt;
&gt;The Digital Cash report defines ways in which the NII will facilitate
&gt;existing and new forms of commerce. "It describes the functional
&gt;requirements and technical options for conducting everyday financial
&gt;transactions in networked electronic settings with the ease and certainty
&gt;of today's cash economy -- and with more security and control," said Dan
&gt;Schutzer of Citibank who chairs the XIWT Applications Services Working
&gt;Team.
&gt;
&gt;"The flexibility and choice implicit in the architecture we have described
&gt;will be a boon to the users of the NII and provide a challenging but
&gt;fertile business environment for savvy companies in many different
&gt;industries," said Niel Ransom of BellSouth, who chairs the XIWT
&gt;Architecture Working Team. "The members of XIWT are committed to making it
&gt;happen."
&gt;
&gt;The XIWT papers quickly received praise from the White House. "By bringing
&gt;together the views and technical recommendations of such a diverse group of
&gt;U.S. companies, the XIWT has made significant progress in moving the work
&gt;on the NII another important step forward." said Vice President Al Gore.
&gt;"We commend the work they have done so far and urge them to continue
&gt;working to define the technical aspects of the NII."
&gt;
&gt;The Cross-Industry Working Team (XIWT) was formed in 1993 to develop a
&gt;technical vision for the NII, XIWT members include over forty companies
&gt;from a range of U.S. industries. Membership list attached.
