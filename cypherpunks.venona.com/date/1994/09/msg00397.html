But they *could*.  It would involve a lot of work, but theoretically, they
could, right?  That still puts it in the catagory of "trade off."  Besides,
I suspect your situation isn't a common one. ;-)

&gt;I guess it depends on your level of paranoia or guilt. :) If I was just
&gt;putzing around with the software, then I wouldn't be too concerned. If I
&gt;was actually doing something illegal or confidential with the software
&gt;then I would be greatly concerned. But under no circumstances would I
&gt;consider that arrangement secure. If the cops nail this guy, he has no one

I don't consider myself "putzing" around with the software.  Besides the
fact that the more encrypted messages are out there, the less "suspicious"
one becomes, I send things like credit card numbers and the like via email.
Nothing that would embarass me, but not something I like to have floating
around.

&gt;Then you have the possibility of people sending you secure messages on a
&gt;compromised key. (The one on the Unix Box) In most cases, its not the
&gt;technology that nails you, it's human error. Take for example the recent

Good point.  Although I would hope that if I were doing something
nefarious, I would have smarter partners than that. :-)
