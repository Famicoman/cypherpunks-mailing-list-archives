Why not make distributed remailers then? You could set up a chain using 
either mail or ftp or ? that would take all messages and fragment them 
into nice 1K blocks and then either mail or otherwise transport the 
blocks to other physical machines, these machines would then follow the 
imbedded instructions on how to reassemble the blocks into a coherent 
message and mail it out. Admittedly there is no sure fire method to 
prevent someone from monitoring all of the traffic generated but it 
should be possible to generate so much traffic that just wading through 
the volume would take more time than is practical. Also by encrypting 
all packets going between remailers and making the packets uniform 
sizes should help make monitoring more difficult.

I'm not sure that I'm worried about the government monitoring my 
communications as much as I'm worried about individuals with bad 
intentions monitoring my communications.
