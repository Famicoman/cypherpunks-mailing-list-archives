I got this on the ars-magica mailing list, as can be seen from the headers
below.  This is a very long post, including a list of all the tentacles and
"horrible" things that the cypherpunks do.  I'm keeping it as a reference so I
can be sure who is a tentacle and who isn't.

Enjoy!

The recent WHITE HOT interest by multiple groups and individuals in the 

                 CYBERANARCHIST TENTACLE INFILTRATIONS

into the Internet have inspired an EXCITING NEW CONTEST and COMPETITION!

we, the Federation of Associations of Cyberspace Everywhere (FACE), 
announce the 

        SUPREMELY QUACKY UNIFIED INTERNET SNAKE HUNT! (SQUISH)


          * THOUSANDS OF CONTESTANTS * HUGE CASH PRIZES *
         * FASCINATING DISCOVERIES * HEDONISTIC DELIGHTS * 
       * FANTASTIC FUN FOR EVERYONE * FAMOUS PARTICIPANTS *

OBJECT OF SQUISH

  the OBJECT of SQUISH is to find TENTACLES and SNAKES.  A TENTACLE is
  an email address used by a real person for the purpose of
  concealing their identity from others. A SNAKE is a TENTACLE that
  is particularly wicked and evil and will lie and trick others into
  believing the TENTACLE is real. In words, the more consequential
  and malicious a TENTACLE, the more it is a SNAKE.

  Different points are awarded for playing. Anyone who can send mail
  can play! The simplest and cheapest points come from sending email
  to suspected  SNAKES and TENTACLES, and chalking up points
  depending on the responses. Larger points are awarded for `real
  world' interactions such as calling  suspected tentacles and snakes
  at their telephone numbers. The largest points of all are awared
  for finding tentacle infiltrations into important Internet and real
  world outlets such as journals and news magazines!

  When a snake or tentacle gets upset in response to mail, it is said
  to be QUIVERING. It will go through CONTORTIONS to convince you to
  leave it alone and may begin to SQUIRM if you persist. When people
  are not writing through fake email addresses, they are said to be
  using their TRUE NAME. TRUE NAMES may go through quivering,
  contortions, and squirming too. Sometimes snakes or tentacles may
  threaten to stop using an email account entirely. If they do they
  are said to SELF DESTRUCT or be EXORCIZED DEMONS (these are
  extremely rare). The TRUE NAME of a person behind a tentacle is
  also called the MOTHER or the MONSTER.
  
  Some of the TRUE NAMES are BIG MACS and some are SMALL FRIES. Much
  larger points are awarded for exposing the BIG MACS, but some
  points are available for SMALL FRIES. BIG MACS are famous people on
  the Internet-- people that no one would expect have snakes and
  tentacles, or have media stories written about them. Massive points
  are awarded for BIG MAC exposures.
  
  When different MOTHERS and MONSTERS send out TENTACLE-GRAMS or
  SNAKEMAIL, they are said to be MOLESTING people. Sometimes the BIG
  MACS molest followers, SMALL FRIES, or even other BIG MACS.
  Sometimes they molest unsuspecting INNOCENT BYSTANDERS, this is
  called RAPING VIRGINS. When a lot of MONSTERS get together in  a
  pack and attack, it is called GANG RAPE. A MONSTER commenting on
  himself through snakemail or replying to one of his own postings is
  called INBREEDING. When BIG MACS are involved it is called INCEST.
  
  Anyone who knows about a tentacle or other CONSPIRACY, an `insider',
  is called TAINTED. People who don't know are called CLEAN. Some
  CLEAN and BYSTANDERS are particularly NAIVE and believe everything
  that BIG MACS and MEDUSA says, they are called BRAINWASHED. The
  ones that defend BIG MACS and MEDUSA are called BLIND. Those
  that simply don't care are called BRAIN DEAD.
  
  Many of the TRUE NAMES and BIG MACS promote various philosophies
  that are directly opposed to their actual actions. They are called
  STELLAR HYPOCRITES, and points are awarded for uncovering them.
  Some of the BIG MACS even regularly betray their BRAINWASHED and
  BRAINDEAD defenders and apologists and even fellow BIG MACS. The
  followers who are striving to become BIG MACS themselves are 
  called WANNABES. They are called TRAITORS guilty of HIGH TREASON.
  Valuable points are award for players who ATTACK the STELLAR
  HYPOCRITES  or BIG MACS using such strategies as TICKLING, POKING,
  and COUNTERMEASURES like name calling, negative publicity, public
  and private pressure, smear campaigns, mudslinging, humiliation,
  exposure, etc.

  Matches take place in Cyberspace on the PLAYFIELD, with different
  regions consisting of INFECTED OUTLETS, CRIME SCENES, and KILLING
  FIELDS. A KILLING FIELD is a place where a tentacle and a player
  compete or a Big Mac is assaulted. INFECTED OUTLETS are media
  outlets or journals that carry BIG MAC propaganda, disinformation,
  or lies. A CRIME SCENE is a place where provably illegal activity
  takes place, e.g. someone passes a bribe. The more trusted an
  INFECTED OUTLET, the more INSIDIOUS the lie. Some INFECTED OUTLETS
  are particularly corrupt, they are called TOXIC WASTE DUMPS.

  The grand point prizes go to anyone who can expose MEDUSA. MEDUSA is
  the leader of all SMALL FRIES and BIG MACS, a wicked, evil
  incarnation of SATAN on the Internet. She is the originator and
  chief proseletyzer of the art, science, and religion of lies.
  MEDUSA has dozens of SNAKES  all over the Internet, particularly in
  extremely sensitive areas such as Internet protocol development
  (e.g. mercantile or digital cash protocols), posting from public
  access sites and even `covers' and `front' sites, these are called
  POISON NEEDLES. Corrupt administrators are always either BIG MACS
  or SMALL FRIES. Some sites have administrators who are unaware or
  apathetic toward infiltrations, these are called PAWNS.
  
  When MEDUSA infiltrates many sites and spews extremely  dangerous
  disinformation and propaganda, this is called SABOTAGE. Telling
  people to go somewhere else and dominating conversations with
  irrelevant topics is called STRANGLING or GANG RAPE. Stealing
  sensitive information from others is called ESPIONAGE. Sabotage,
  strangling, espionage, and other types of cyberterrorism are called
  POISON. MEDUSA hides her activities beneath the various phrases
  PRIVACY FOR THE MASSES, the CRYPTOGRAPHIC REVOLUTION, and
  CRYPTOANARCHY in respectable media outlets like Wired and the New
  York Times. Sometimes this is accomplished by fooling reporters,
  but note that not all reporters are CLEAN, and bribery may be
  possible.
  
  MEDUSA is the orchestrator of a MASSIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY to
  STRANGLE, SABOTAGE, and POISON THE INTERNET. Anyone who can drive
  MEDUSA and all the corrupt BIG MACS from Cyberspace and the real
  world forever is called THE SAVIOR and said to have DRIVEN THE
  PHARISEES FROM THE TEMPLE. However, the player must avoid being
  CRUCIFIED or the cash award will not be given.

  POINTS can be traded in for COLD CASH. The first person with more
  than  500 points gets A DOLLAR PER POINT (some restrictions apply,
  not valid in all areas, void where prohibited by law, taxes may
  vary).

SQUISH DIRECTIONS

1. Consult the list of SUSPECTED SMALL FRIES, BIG MACS, SNAKES,
  TENTACLES, MEDUSA &amp; SISTERS, and POISON NEEDLES below. Send mail to
  any attempting to discover whether they are real or fake, or have
  knowledge of other BIG MACS or even MEDUSA. 

2. When you get CONTORTIONS or SQUIRMS, or mount COUNTERMEASURES,
  keep track of your all your points in a file. Ratings are listed
  under RATINGS below. List the persons and email addresses involved
  and quote the actual mail. Keep permanent and complete records of
  all mail.

3. Where possible, record phone numbers and call tentacles. Special
  bonus points are awarded when the snake owner is not in the same
  state as the snake, and you can prove it.

4. The biggest points are awarded for the greatest deceptions. Some
  snakes in the lists below (the most deceitful ones) have actually
  installed out-of-state phone numbers, developed software for
  coordination, and have an international arsenal of infiltration
  points.

5. In particular go after the BIG MACS and MEDUSA, where the most
  fantastic points are awarded. Some BIG MACS know of MEDUSA; they
  are called MEDUSA'S SISTERS.

6. if a suspected TENTACLE or SNAKE *ever* admits to being a tentacle
  or snake, they are not valid. This game only applies to tentacles
  and snakes who play the game themselves with QUIVERING, SQUIRMS,
  and CONTORTIONS.

7. The categories listed below of SUSPECTED SNAKES, TENTACLES,
  ACCOMPLICES, BIG MACS, and  MEDUSA are not conclusive or
  definitive. In particular, some people in these lists may be
  INNOCENT BYSTANDERS, and their harassment should be minimized. But,
  be careful! the SNAKES, TENTACLES, ACCOMPLICES, BIG MACS, and
  MEDUSA will all claim to be INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.

8. The best players and highest awards are recorded periodically in
  the HALL OF SHAME.

announcements.)

SUSPECTED ACCOMPLICES (SMALL FRIES)
===

1  Steve Klingsporn &lt;moofie@apple.com&gt;
2  Geoff Dale &lt;plaz@netcom.com&gt;

  Klingsporn and Dale are housemates and were involved in the defense
  of the known tentacle szabo@netcom.com. Dale appears to have close
  ties to the  T.C.May Big Mac. Klingsporn has some knowledge but is
  mostly uninvolved.


SUSPECTED FAKE ADDRESSES (SNAKES AND TENTACLES)
===

5  Caleb@sidefx.sidefx.com

  A Canadian tentacle and infiltration site of T.C.May's. No 
  prominent profile known.

6  Jamie Dinkelacker &lt;jamie@netcom.com&gt;

  Not particularly interesting any more either except that he has a
  phone number and has close ties to T.C.May. In fact, very likely he
  is a T.C.May tentacle. Very arrogant, obnoxious, and cruel. 
  Delights in torture. Puerile threats.

7  Matthew B. Landry &lt;mbl@ml7694a.leonard.american.edu&gt;

  Landry has a telephone number in Washington, and supposedly goes to
  school there. He is a suspected T.C.May tentacle. He has posted to
  the Cypherpunks list in the past. He is highly dangerous and will
  tell lies to gain sympathy or credibility and then betray later.
  Not particularly interesting any more but was involved in some
  extremely grotesque inbreeding with T.C.May on the cypherpunks
  list.

8  Peter Bachman &lt;pbachman@skidmore.EDU&gt;

  P.Bachman has contributed to the Society for Electronic Access list
  and others. He is actually a tentacle. Maybe a P.Metzger snake.
  Most disturbingly he has infiltrated RISKS.

9  Nick Collision &lt;mathew@mantis.co.uk&gt;

  Nick Collision has also infiltrated RISKS. A tentacle, but unknown
  origin-- possibly a T.C.May snake. Supposedly lives in the United
  Kingdom somewhere but refuses to comment specifically or give a
  phone number. Edits the alt.atheist FAQ (atheism is another classic
  Cyberanarchist philosophy). If Collision is a proven tentacle, the
  cyberanarchist infiltration is provably international in scope,
  with fake domain fronts. No known jobs have ever been performed
  by the `software consultants' at mantis.co.uk.

10  Arthur Chandler &lt;arthurc@crl.com&gt;

  On the Future Culture list and Cypherpunks. probably an E.Hughes
  tentacle. This may be a wedge into discovering credit or SMTP
  software manipulations by Cypherpunks.

11  Greg Broiles &lt;greg@ideath.goldenbear.com&gt;

  Probably a snake of Medusa. Has intimate knowledge of fake email
  address use, knows about customized software, and has bizarre
  Cyberanarchist  theories relating to human punishment. Strong
  knowledge of Macintosh software and hardware.

12  Eli Brandt &lt;ebrandt@jarthur.Claremont.EDU&gt;

  Definitely has high level knowledge of the Big Macs and Medusa.
  Probably an E.Hughes tentacle. Once wrote, `I AM MEDUSA,
  CONTROLLER OF ALL TENTACLES'.

13  Paul Ferguson &lt;ferguson@icm1.icp.net&gt;

  Another highly dangerous tentacle. Known to steal resumes. One of
  the Washington sites besides M.Landry. Known to have posted 
  cyberanarchist propaganda on the PEM development list.

14  Nick Szabo &lt;szabo@netcom.com&gt;

  The Szabo tentacle is one of the most persistent of all. Even after
  being exposed the `mother monster' continues to post, because a
  fairly significant reputation investment has been established under
  the name. Has strong interest in digital cash. Has admitted to
  knowledge of fake name use. Probably a T.C.May tentacle.

15  Hal Finney &lt;hfinney@shell.portal.com&gt;

  Finney is either a tentacle or an accomplice. If he is a tentacle he
  is the most treasured one of all. Involved in the defense of the
  jamie@netcom.com tentacle. Possibly an E.Hughes snake. Supposedly
  has contributed significant code to anonymous remailers and
  Zimmermann's PGP. (If he is a tentacle, Zimmermann has been
  fooled.) May even be Medusa's snake.

SUSPECTED ASSOCIATES (MEDUSA'S SISTERS)
===

20  Jim McCoy &lt;mccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu&gt;

  A `nerdy' cyberanarchist who does things such as sleep in his
  clothes. Close ties to D.Barnes in Texas. They are working on their
  own digital bank in competition and cooperation with CA
  cyphrepunks. Longtime Usenet poster. Knowledgeable on the most 
  serious subversive activities.

21  Doug Barnes &lt;cman@io.com&gt;

  D.Barnes is a lackey for Big Macs and Medusa. He may attack
  postmasters and coworkers at participating SQUISH player sites.
  Sysadmin of the io.com site. Introduced to fake addresses by
  E.Hughes.

22  Perry Metzger &lt;pmetzger@lehman.com&gt;

  Metzger is the pit bull of the Internet. He has perfected the
  cyberspatial ad hominem attack. He has close ties to all the Big
  Macs and is probably aware of who Medusa is. His own tentacles and
  snakes are minor in comparison. Likes the mailbomb as a threat and
  attack. Probably involved in anonymous phone threats.

23  Bill Stewart &lt;wcs@anchor.ho.att.com&gt;

  This is a very dangerous insider, who has close affiliations with
  the Big Macs and a prestigious job at AT&amp;T. Has claimed to have
  seen  known tentacles and snakes at Cypherpunk parties and even
  seen their driver's licenses. Classic cyberanarchist propaganda
  outlet.


SUSPECTED LEADERS (BIG MACS)
===

25  Stanton McCandlish &lt;mech@eff.org&gt;

  Probably on the secret cypherpunk development lists. Maybe 
  knowledgeable about deceptions by other Big Macs. EFF online
  activist. Definite cyberanarchist apologist and sympathizer.

26  John Gilmore &lt;gnu@toad.com&gt;

  Cyberanarchist, built up Cygnus support. Admitted drug user.
  Probable snake charmer. Generally more ethical and moral than other
  Big Macs. May be a wedge into them.

27  T.C.May &lt;tcmay@netcom.com&gt;

  Close personal friend of E.Hughes. Worked for Intel and is a
  millionaire in stock values. May be financing the major
  international fake address  infrastructure. Probably manipulating
  dozens of tentacles. May have hired actors and forged drivers
  license to defend tentacles.



SUSPECTED MASTERMIND (MEDUSA)
===

40  Eric Hughes &lt;hughes@soda.berkeley.edu&gt; &lt;hughes@ah.com&gt;

  Hughes is probably the mastermind of all major tentacle
  manipulations on the Internet. Has bizarre theories about human
  punishment and law enforcement. Denies any involvement. May be
  involved in illegal credit scanning. Interested in black
  marketeering, money laundering, etc. Very terse in all mail.
  Refuses to comment on all areas. Extremely dangerous. Has
  personally established many of the corrupt sites particularly in
  WA, CA, and TX.

       * FANTASTIC FUN FOR EVERYONE * SCANDALOUS CORRUPTION *


SUSPECTED CORRUPT SITES (POISON NEEDLES)
===

  Note: Any site supporting a snake can be corrupt, so that proven
  snakes lead to proven corrupt sites (see above). Those listed below
  are only the more serious ones.

0  netcom.com

  Paradise for cyberanarchists. Cheap, unauthenticated accounts
  indistinguishable from the real people. `Privacy' never violated so
  far by the Pawns. Close proximity to the CA cypherpunks. Home of
  dozens of snakes and tentacles. Cyberanarchist Central.

10  io.com

  D.Barnes' site. Lots of other fake addresses from inconsequential
  tentacles not listed above.
  
40  mantis.co.uk

  Supposedly a group of software consultants, but probably a 
  cyberanarchist front. Could be a major wedge into the
  cyberanarchist conspiracy if exposed; has some links to the
  `Extropian' movement.

50  crl.com

  Probably corrupted by associations with E.Hughes and credit and SMTP
  tampering, based on the Chandler tentacle.

100  sun.com

THE SMALL PRINT ON POINTS
===

  All point values are subject to change without notice. some new
  categories may be added. some points may be decreased, some
  increased.

A NOTE ABOUT YOUR OPPONENTS
===

  The entities listed above, i.e. your opponents in SQUISH, are
  extremely sophisticated and have years of practice in fake email
  address use, and have learned how to rebuff and thwart even the
  most determined inquiries. They have extremely powerful resources
  at their disposal, including dozens of public access acounts, front
  sites, cover stories, and automated software for identity tracking,
  and sizeable investments in hardware and their own countermeasures.
  You will be attacking their most cherished vices and lies and they
  will respond viciously. They may be involved in criminal activities
  such as credit and telephony tampering, forgery, impersonation,
  fraud, etc. Beware of dangerous hazards they have erected or may
  hurl at you.


UPDATES
===

  updates on the SQUISH contest will be posted regularly. Send in
  notice of the more spectacular point accumulations with proof for
  verifications immediately and the Halls of Fame and Shame.
  Unverified points are not valid toward the cash prize.


THE CASH PRIZE
===

  A cash prize will be awarded to the first person to surpass 500
  points, one dollar per point. The person may continue playing to
  continue to gain cash. Further awards may be presented to close
  contenders. Some restrictions apply. Void where prohibited. Tax not
  included. In the case of deceased victims the award will be given
  to the nearest living relative, or the Federation of Associations
  of Cyberspace Everywhere (FACE) if all relatives have met 
  mysterious fatal accidents as well. If the world economies have
  collapsed from cyberanarchist sabotage before the award is 
  granted, no further action is necessary (this constitutes the final
  sign of the Apocalypse).


DEADLINE
===

  TIME IS RUNNING OUT! AVOID INQUIRING FURTHER OR WAITING FOR FURTHER
  INSTRUCTIONS. START IMMEDIATELY! MONTHS OF PARTICIPATION ARE
  REQUIRED TO ACCUMULATE COMPETITIVE STANDING. SOME PARTICIPANTS
  ALREADY HAVE A HEAD START.
  
  THE CASH PRIZE WILL BE AWARDED APRIL 1, 1994. FURTHER INCREMENTS
  WILL BE AWARDED AT YEARLY INTERVALS THEREAFTER.


MORE ABOUT `SQUISH' AND `FACE'
===

  The Federation of Associations of Cyberspace, Everywhere was founded
  in 1994 as a group that coordinates the activities among the many
  different online organizations. We have played a very low-profile
  role to date, and wanted to find some way of promoting our newfound
  alliance. We have groups combined from BBSes, local area networks,
  the Internet, and other global and local networks around the world
  (see below).

  We have built up some membership funds from the contributing
  organizations and private contributions to provide the prize money
  for SQUISH, and some private individuals have donated significant
  amounts. The contest was inspired by S.Boxx, who was the architect
  of point classifications and the current opponent lists. S.Boxx has
  also promised to provide any funds necessary for the successful
  completion of the contest. We hope that recent interest into snakes
  and tentacles by many on the Internet will make the contest
  spirited entertainment and a strong success.

  We encourage reporters and the media to use this announcement as our
  official press release. Feel free to redistribute or comment on
  this announcement in any forum.
