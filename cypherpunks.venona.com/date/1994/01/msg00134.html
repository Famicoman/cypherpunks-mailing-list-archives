Here's the IIA info message that has caused all the furor:

Forwarded message:
From info@iia.org Mon Jan 10 14:31:54 1994

The text in this document is how we envision our host machine to
look in the very near future.  Please be patient if some things
are not currently available.  We are working on this system daily
to improve it.


Welcome to the International Internet Association  - the largest
non-profit provider of free Internet access in the world.  We are
a Washington based association dedicated to the free flow of
information without regard to position or affiliation. We look
forward to serving you.

In response to your request we need a little more information to
set up an account and get you on-line.  Please complete the
attached form and return to our offices in Washington. You will
advance in line quicker if you simply fax back the attached
registration form at the end of this document.

When received we will provision accounts in the order received. 
We have responded to over fifteen thousand requests in the last
several weeks, and we greatly appreciate your continued patience. 
 
WHO AM I ON THE INTERNET?

We will assign a USERID (User Identification) which combines your
first and last name in accordance with international standards
governing E-mail.  All accounts will be eight characters or less
beginning with the last name and ending with the first initial. 
For example John Smith will become SMITHJ.  If your last name is
over seven characters only the first seven characters will be
used.  If you would like a specific ID, this can be arranged as
well as other custom services upon your first login.  You need
only follow the menu items to custom services and make the
electronic request.  Since you will gain access to the Internet
through the IIA your address to the rest of the internet
community will be USERID@IIA.ORG  where USERID is the name we
generated using your last name first initial.

WHAT DO I GET?

     You get an Internet account providing 14,400 BPS capability
     and lower (9600,2400,1200).   

     256K of storage allowing you to download files and messages
     (more can be made available).  

     Kermit, X-MODEM, Y-Modem, and Z-MODEM download protocols to
     transfer information to your home computer.  

     Menu driven options will allow easy access to GOPHER, World-
     Wide-Web, Archie, Prospect, Telnet, FTP and a host of others
     (no pun intended)

In short you can do what anyone else anywhere can do on the net
and more (we have built in capabilities beyond the general
capabilities of the Internet).

ACCESS

The International Internet Association is able to make this
service available through generous private donations, and
extraordinary dedication of its membership.  We will invite users
to join, but will in no way restrict access based on membership.

WHAT TO EXPECT

You will receive two numbers with your welcome aboard package.  
One is a direct dial number to either our master node in
Washington D.C., or our research facility in New Jersey.  If you
choose to direct dial it is your responsibility to pay your long
distance carrier for the time spent on-line.  Your bill will be
identical to the cost of calling and speaking to someone.  The
cost of a phone call.

The second option is to receive an 800 number provided by the
IIA.  The IIA has made arrangements for this service to be
provided universally across the U.S. 24 hours a day at the rate
of 20 cents per minute.  (The 20 cents is billed exactly at cost
through the generous contribution of our supporting provider).
You need to look at your long distance rate from your current
provider and decide the most economical way to reach our nodes.
The IIA plans to install local calling points across the U.S. to
support our users, as soon as we obtain the funds.

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU:

Please complete the enclosed form in its entirety.  Pay careful
attention to the accuracy of your name and address.  We need a
Master Card, Visa, Or American Express.  When we provision your
account you will have access to both the direct dial, and the
U.S. 800 number.  
If you do not use the 800 number you will never receive a charge. 
If you find the 800 number more economical than direct dial than
you will be billed in 10 dollar increments.  A charge will be
rolled over until all time has been exhausted.  Without receiving
a Credit Card Number, the IIA cannot provision an account.  
(We apologize for this inconvenience to our users planning on
direct dial.  Shortly we plan to rectify this through programming,
but until that time we must adhere to the policy of our
long-distance provider.)

WELCOME ABOARD PACKAGE

Your welcome aboard package will contain additional information
about the IIA including your USERID and Password (required for
login) and instructions on how to login.  We will also provide
information on the Internet services available.  However the
majority of the useful information can be found on-line by
following the menus to the help section.

OUR THANKS

The IIA would like to thank-you for your interest in becoming
part of the electronic community, and we look forward to serving
in the capacity of your host.  We trust it will change you life.
