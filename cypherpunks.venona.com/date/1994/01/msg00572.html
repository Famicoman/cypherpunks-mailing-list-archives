CP's:  seems like this might be a chance to preach the PGP sermon and possibly
make $2500 - no doubt crypto tech is an issue here:

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Contest seeks essays on joint warfare
&gt; 
&gt;     ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Army News Service) -- If you can write about
&gt; joint operations, you could win $2,500.
&gt;     After four years of sponsoring the Warfighting Essay Contest,
&gt; the U.S. Naval Institute, Annapolis, Md., is opening the contest to
&gt; other services. Named for the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
&gt; of Staff, the Colin L. Powell Joint Warfighting Essay Contest
&gt; offers $2,500, $2,000 and $1,000 for the three best entries.
&gt;     The competition seeks "those who are motivated to enter this
&gt; contest not by a need to 'toe the policy line,' but who are devoted
&gt; to the security of this great nation," Powell said.
&gt;     All servicemembers and civilians are welcome to enter. They
&gt; should write about combat readiness in a joint context --
&gt; discussions of tactics, strategy, weaponry, combat training or
&gt; other issues involving two or more services. 
&gt;     Essays can feature one service in detail, but they must apply
&gt; to joint force structure, doctrine, operations or organization for
&gt; combat. They may discuss the interoperability of hardware and
&gt; procedures, within the context of combat readiness.
&gt;     Entries can be no longer than 3,000 words, and must be
&gt; postmarked no later than April 1. Shorter opinion pieces or
&gt; "professional notes" -- typically 2,000-word technical arguments --
&gt; may also be competitive.
&gt;     Following are the entry rules, as set by the U.S. Naval
&gt; Institute --
&gt; -- Essays must be original, not to exceed 3,000 words, and not have
&gt; been previously published. An exact word count must appear on the
&gt; title page.
&gt; -- Mail entries to: Colin L. Powell Joint Warfighting Essay
&gt; Contest; U.S. Naval Institute; 118 Maryland Ave.; Annapolis, Md.;
&gt; 21402-5035.
&gt; -- Entries must be postmarked on or before April 1.
&gt; -- For fairness, entries will not be identified by the author's
&gt; name -- the name must not appear on the essay. The author will give
&gt; the essay a motto, in addition to a title. This motto will appear
&gt; on the title page, with the title. It will also be written by
&gt; itself on the outside of an accompanying sealed envelope. Enclosed
&gt; will be the author's name, address, phone number, Social Security
&gt; number, a short biography, essay title and motto. Envelopes will
&gt; not be opened until the winners are chosen.
&gt; -- Entrants must submit two complete copies of the essays,
&gt; typewritten, double-spaced, on 8-1/2x11-inch paper. Authors who use
&gt; computers are also asked to submit IBM-compatible disks and specify
&gt; which word-processing software was used.
&gt; -- The essays will be screened by a panel of officers from the five
&gt; armed services. The panel will recommend six essays to the Naval
&gt; Institute's Editorial Board, which will award the three cash
&gt; prizes.
&gt; -- The winners will be notified by phone in late May. Letters
&gt; notifying all other entrants will be mailed by mid-June. Awards
&gt; will be presented in July.
&gt; -- The three top essays will be published in "Proceedings," the
&gt; Naval Institute's magazine. Non-winning essays may also be
&gt; published; their authors will be paid at the magazine's regular
&gt; rate.
