&gt;Seems to me that if a person places a post on a public access newsgroup
&gt;withoug a copyright it automaticaly becomes public domain and they loose all
&gt;commercial rights to it. I would be interested in a public discussion of thsi
&gt;point and will move over to the newsgroup you mentioned.

Actually, that statement is quite false. I highly recommend that everyone
interested in this topic read Terry Carroll's excellent Copyright FAQ,
available for anonymous FTP from rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.209],
in directory /pub/usenet/news.answers/law/Copyright-FAQ, files part1 -
part6.

To quote from Copyright-FAQ part2:
&gt;2.3) I just wrote a great program/novel/song/whatever.  How can I get a
&gt;copyright on it?
&gt;
&gt;Good news.  You already have.  In the United States, as in most nations,
&gt;a work is copyrighted as soon as it is created:
&gt;
&gt;   Copyright protection subsists . . . in original works of
&gt;   authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now
&gt;   known or later developed, from which they can be perceived,
&gt;   reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with
&gt;   the aid of a machine or device.  17 U.S.C. 102(a).
&gt;
&gt;and,
&gt;
&gt;   A work is "fixed" in a tangible medium of expression when its
&gt;   embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority
&gt;   of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it
&gt;   to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a
&gt;   period of more than transitory duration.  17 U.S.C. 101.
&gt;
&gt;What this means in simple terms is that as soon as you've created your
&gt;original work, it's copyrighted.  Because of the "either directly or with
&gt;the aid of a machine or device" provision, it doesn't matter whether
&gt;you've printed it out, or if it's only on your hard drive or floppy disk.
&gt;
&gt;You don't need any special formalities, such as registering the work with
&gt;the Copyright Office, or providing a copyright notice (notice stopped
&gt;being a requirement when the U.S. signed the Berne Convention and enacted
&gt;Berne Convention Implementation Act in 1988; see section 4.1 for more
&gt;information).

Howevever, just because any posting you made after 1988 is automatically
copyrighted by you does not mean that you still can't put it on your CD:

To quote from Copyright-FAQ part3:
&gt;3.8) Are Usenet postings and email messages copyrighted?
&gt;
&gt;Almost certainly.  They meet the requirement of being original works of
&gt;authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression (see section 2.3).
&gt;They haven't been put in the public domain; generally, only an expiration
&gt;of copyright or an unambiguous declaration by an author is sufficient to
&gt;place a work into public domain.
&gt;
&gt;However, at least with Usenet postings, there are two doctrines which
&gt;probably allow at least some copying: fair use (see sections 2.8 and 2.9)
&gt;and implied license.
&gt;
&gt;Whether a particular use of a Usenet posting is a fair use is, as always,
&gt;a very fact-specific determination.  However, it's probably safe to say
&gt;that it's a fair use if the use was not commercial in nature, the posting
&gt;was not an artistic or dramatic work (e.g.,, it was the writer's opinion,
&gt;or a declaration of facts, and not something like a poem or short story),
&gt;only as much of the posting was copied as was necessary (e.g., a short
&gt;quotation for purposes of criticism and comment), and there was little or
&gt;no impact on any market for the posting.
&gt;
&gt;A similar argument can be made for quoting of private email messages.  Of
&gt;course, revealing the contents of a private email message could run afoul
&gt;of any of a number of non-copyright laws: defamation, invasion of
&gt;privacy, and trade secrecy, to name a few.  So even if you won't be
&gt;violating any copyright laws, you should consider other factors that may
&gt;expose you to legal liability before revealing a private message's
&gt;contents.
&gt;
&gt;Proponents of the implied license idea point out that Usenet postings are
&gt;routinely copied and quoted, and anyone posting to Usenet is granting an
&gt;implied license for others to similarly copy or quote that posting, too.
&gt;It's not clear whether such implied license extends beyond Usenet, or
&gt;indeed, what "Usenet" really means (does it include, for example,
&gt;Internet mailing lists?  Does it include netnews on CD-ROM?).  If a
&gt;posting includes an express limitation on the right to copy or quote,
&gt;it's not at all certain whether the express limitation or the implied
&gt;license will control.  No doubt it depends on the specific facts.  For
&gt;example, was the limitation clearly visible to the person who did the
&gt;copying?  Was the limitation placed such that it would be visible only
&gt;after the person who did the copying invested time and money to get the
&gt;posting, believing it to be without any limitation?
&gt;
&gt;With private email messages, a copier who relies solely on the implied
&gt;license argument will probably lose, since it's hard to argue that by
&gt;sending the private message to a limited audience, the sender intended
&gt;for it to be copied and quoted.  For email messages to a public mailing
&gt;list, the implied license argument may still be sound.
&gt;
&gt;These theories are largely speculative, because there has been little
&gt;litigation to test them in the courts.  As a practical matter, most
&gt;postings, with a small number of notable exceptions, are not registered
&gt;with the Copyright Office.  As such, to prevail in court, the copyright
&gt;holder would need to show actual damages (see section 2.5).  Since most
&gt;of these cases will result in little or no actual damage, no cases have
&gt;been be brought; it's simply too expensive to sue for negligible damages.

There is quite a bit of discussion on this topic in misc.legal newsgroup,
as well as in the lists faq-maintainers@mit.edu and cni-copyright@cni.org.
