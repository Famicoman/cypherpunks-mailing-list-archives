Friends, extropians, cypherpunks:

The year is new, I hope to find a new job, too.
If you are involved in, or know about, 
forward-looking projects that would interest me, 
I'm looking forward to hearing from you. IUve achieved
quite a few personal goals recently: I've launched 
and publicized Stego, the first steganography tool
for the Macintosh, developed a part time job as a print model,
worked on various extropian essays, traveled and vacationed.
Once again, it's time to find work, so I am posting my resume.
