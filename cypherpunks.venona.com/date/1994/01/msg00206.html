God, he's a loonie. This is half composed of a message I posted,
partially other messages, and partially his own. I have no idea if
"Jeremy Anderson" is a stolen identity.

However, its very doubtful that he's going to be a problem in my life
for long -- I'm going to finish up setting up my long promised
moderated cryptography mailing list tonight or tommorrow and will be
announcing it at Usenix. (Please don't send me mail asking me about it
-- there will be a formal announcement.)

&gt; Mr. Detweiler, I would claim that you have the brain of a cabbage, but
&gt; obviously you've expended a fair quntity of intellect figuring out this
&gt; tremendous conspiracy of cryptoanarchists and their devious leaders
&gt; attempting to sink you (if they're anarchists, how can they have leaders
&gt; anyhow?)
&gt; 
&gt; Dozens of people have stated that they have met all the people you
&gt; think are the same. You are living in a self-consistant delusion --
&gt; there is no way to demonstrate to your satisfaction that your claims
&gt; are false, because you won't accept testimonial evidence and you wont
&gt; go through any effort to check out the evidence you have been given
&gt; that you can check out yourself. There is no amount of effort that
&gt; will convince you of the truth. Meanwhile, you continue to post huge
&gt; disruptive messages about topics 99% of the net doesn't care about
&gt; both under your name and under "an12070@anon.penet.fi" to dozens of
&gt; newsgroups. I'd say if anyone around here is a problem its YOU.
&gt; 
&gt; Nick Szabo is a real human being, last I checked.   He was a computer
&gt; science major at U.W. and later worked at JPL in Pasadena.  He shared a
&gt; basement apartment with a Tibetan holy man.  While he was about as odd
&gt; as any other hardcore C-Sci guy I know of, he's a lousy candidate to be
&gt; a leader, a tentacle, or any other part of a massive cryptoanarchist
&gt; conspiracy.
&gt; 
&gt; This won't dissuade you (obviously, I'm just another member of the
&gt; conspiracy.  My tenous link with Nick proves it for a fact.  In fact,
&gt; Jeremy Anderson is just an alias!  I picked up the driver's license,
&gt; credit cards, passport, and personality dossier 8 years ago in Tiajuana
&gt; from a shadowy man known only as "rodriguez, with two lower case r's".)
&gt; Let's try a different tact.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes Detweiler.  You have sucessfully exposed the international
&gt; cryptoanarchist conspiracy.  Unfortunately, our vast experience with
&gt; media manipulation and our connections with the highest levels of
&gt; government will hamper your ability to make further progress.  We are
&gt; proud to count as members of our conspiracy such luminaries as Socks
&gt; Clinton, Bobby Inman, Connie Chung Yu-Hwa (who while mascarading as a
&gt; mild-mannered TV anchor is our connection with the Chinese Kuomintang's
&gt; massive intelligence apparatus), and the 23 secret leaders of the
&gt; Masons.  We've been monitoring your actions for years with bugs,
&gt; wiretaps, and secret agents.  One night, while you slept, a crack
&gt; surgical terrorist team entered your domicile, sedated you heavily, and
&gt; planted radio-controlled electrodes in your head.  Should you ever get a
&gt; positive identification on any of the leaders of our cabal, a radio
&gt; signal will be sent causing you to go into a massive seizure, whereupon
&gt; the elctrodes will disintegrate, leaving no trace of our work for the
&gt; forensics experts to sift through.
&gt; 
&gt; The situation really is hopless Detweiler.  We can wipe your existence
&gt; off the face of the planet any time.  While we figure you're too driven
&gt; and fanatical to co-opt, we're happy to fight to a draw.
&gt; 
&gt; Congratulate yourself.  Your superior intellect has exposed more about
&gt; the inner workings of our organization (and I use the term loosely) than
&gt; we expected any mere mortal to be able to manage.  We consider our
&gt; protection mechanisms to be strong enough that you won't be able to
&gt; cause much damage to our command and control structure.  Relax, take the
&gt; day to go hiking in the mountains, enjoy life, and know that your
&gt; personal desires and plans are safe from interference for now.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jeremy Anderson
&gt; 
&gt; Assistant Secretary of Propaganda
&gt; United Thought Patrol
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  Don't try to archive this message, it's wired with virtual explosives.
