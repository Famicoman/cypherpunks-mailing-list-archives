 "CYBERSPACE SUPERHIGHWAYS: ACCESS, ETHICS and CONTROL

 Cyberspace, Information Superhighway, National Information
 Infrastructure, Open Platforms, Computer and Communications
 Revolution, Electronic Networks, Digital Data Bases and Information
 Society are words and phrases common to the rhetoric of our modern
 era.  The relationships between and among individuals, society,
 nations, government entities and business organizations are in
 constant flux as new stresses and alliances change the old "rules
 of the game."  Today's challenges are to define what is the "game,"
 who owns the "franchises," who can play, what are the rules and who
 calls the shots.  Information and communications technology raise
 new issues for freedom and privacy in this new era.  Such questions
 are on the agenda as the participants in CFP'94 consider the
 alternatives and seek some solutions.  Come, join in the dialogue
 that will help to shape the world's future!

 PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS

 On Wednesday March 23, the day before the formal conference begins,
 CFP '94 is offering a number of in-depth tutorials covering a wide
 variety of subjects on five parallel tracks.  These presentations
 will be interesting, educational, thought-provoking and often
 controversial.  The tutorials are available at a nominal additional
 registration cost.

 CONFERENCE NEWSPAPER

 On each of the three days of the conference, a daily newspaper will
 appear to highlight what has transpired and announce important
 coming events.  The staff of "The Decisive Utterance," The John
 Marshall Law School's student newspaper, is providing this service.


 CONFERENCE RECEPTION AND TECHNOLOGY DISPLAY

 On Wednesday evening, from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m., you are invited
 to meet new and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception
 at the John Marshall Law School from 6:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. The School
 is only two blocks from the conference hotel.  A state-of-the-art
 computer lab will be used to demonstrate high-tech applications in
 academia and registrants will be invited to take part.
 ^LSINGLE-TRACK MAIN PROGRAM

 The technological revolution that is driving change in our society
 has many facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit
 together, especially those parts that lie outside one's own daily
 experience. An important goal of CFP '94 is to bring together
 individuals from disparate disciplines and backgrounds and engage
 them in a balanced discussion of CFP issues.  To this end our main
 program, starting on Thursday, March 24, is on a single track
 enabling registrants to attend all sessions.  The concurrent Birds-
 of-a-Feather meetings Thursday after 9:15 p.m. are exceptions.

 BIRDS OF A FEATHER SESSIONS (BoF)

 CFP '94 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to
 interested individuals for informal "Birds of a Feather" sessions
 after the formal program Thursday, from 9:15 p.m. - 11:15 p.m.
 These sessions will provide an opportunity for special-interest
 discussions. For further information or to request a BoF contact
 CFP '94 Program Coordinator, Gary Gassman, at the John Marshall Law
 School (6gassman@jmls.edu)


 MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY GALA

 Registrants are invited to a very special reception and buffet at
 Chicago's famed Museum of Science and Industry where they also will
 be treated to a private showing and demonstration of the MSI's
 newly-opened Communications and Imaging Exhibits.  These multi-
 million dollar presentations occupy 15,000 sq.ft. of museum space
 and required three years to develop.  "Communications" is a
 panoramic display of how technology has transformed our lives by
 dissolving distance and and making connections; visitors can even
 enter the unreal world of virtual reality. "Imaging" is a mind-
 boggling journey through modern applications of imaging technology.
 Visitors can even play the role of brain surgeon, using
 radiosurgery made possible by 3-D imaging, or explore imaging in
 forensic science by using MRI, fingerprint enhancement, face aging
 and other modern technologies to solve a crime!

 REGISTRATION WILL BE LIMITED

 CFP '94 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise
 you to register early to assure admission and to take advantage of
 the early registration discounts.

 MEALS AND RECEPTIONS

 A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction
 between the diverse communities that constitute our audience.  To
 promote this interaction CFP '94 provides three luncheons, three
 receptions and three evening meals with the price of registration.

 EFF PIONEER AWARDS

 All conference attendees are invited to the EFF Pioneer Awards
 Reception sponsored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation on
 Thursday evening.  These, the third annual EFF Pioneer Awards, will
 be given to individuals and organizations that have made
 distinguished contributions to the human and technological realms
 touched by computer-based communications.

 CONFERENCE BUSINESS OFFICE

 The Conference business and registration office will be open from
 8:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on Wednsday thru Friday, and until 6:00
 p.m. on Saturday, for registration and general information.

 NOTE: The following program content and schedule is subject to
 change. The Information Superhighway is a fast track!

 Wednesday, March 23, 1994
 Pre-Conference Tutorials

 9:00 a.m. - noon

      Cyberspace Law for Non-Lawyers
      This tutorial presents an outline of the law for laymen,
      dealing with Constitutional and legal issues that confront
      those concerned with privacy, crime, and freedom of expression
      in cyberspace. There will be summaries of recent cases,
      legislative proposals and government activities.
           Mike Godwin, Online Counsel, EFF

      Rules of the Road for Network Travelers. (CLE Credit Approved)
      The information superhighway presents a variety of rights and
      risks.  Learn about the legal issues of computer networks,
      services and bulletin boards, including on-line property
      rights; protecting personal privacy and business information;
      electronic publishing and multimedia rights; viruses, adult
      materials and other no-nos.
           Lance Rose, Attorney and Author of "Syslaw."

      Get Mad, Get Motivated, Get Moving!
      The focus of this panel is on citizen action for privacy
      protection: how to reach and organize constituents; support
      legislation or other privacy protection measures; conduct
      public education activities; use the technology in program
      activities, etc.
           Robert Ellis Smith, Privacy Journal

      Exploring Internet: A Guided Tour
      This tutorial gives participants a practical introduction to
      the most popular and powerful applications available via the
      world's largest computer network, the Internet.  There will be
      hands-on demonstrations of communications tools such as e-
      mail, conferencing, Internet Relay Chat and resource discover,
      and navigations aids such as Gopher, WAIS, Archie and World
      Wide Web.  Extensive documentation will be provided.
           Mark Graham, Pandora Systems

      Using the Freedom of Information Act
      The Federal FOIA is the principal focus of this tutorial
      though some attention is given to the use of  state FOIAs.
      The session will cover procedures for making requests,
      identifying the information desired, differences between
      electronic and hard copy responses, and the appeals process
      within agencies and the courts.
      David Sobel, Counsel, Computer Professional for Social
      Responsibility

      2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

      Cryptography: What, and How?
      Data encryption is in the cyberspace limelight as perhaps the
      only technique to ensure digital privacy and security; it is
      also the subject of sharp debate regarding control of the
      development and use of the technology.  This tutorial will
      display what encryption is, how it works, and some of the
      options for its use.  Computer animations and graphic displays
      will be used to help make cryptography comprehensible; the
      audience will engage in some hands-on encryption exercises.
           Mark Hellmann, Pattishall, McAuliffe et.al, Chicago

      Electronic Detectives: Critical Issues for Public and Private
      Investigators.
      Both governmental and private sector investigators have
      unprecedented access to "open" sources that were practically
      inaccessible a few years ago.  This information environment
      poses opportunities and risks that will be the focus of this
      program.  Investigative techniques via networks will be
      demonstrated and the legal, ethical and practical issues will
      be explored.  Actual case-studies will be utilized.
      Michael Moran, CCO; Michael Robertson, CFE

      Hi-Tech Intellectual Property Law Primer (CLE Credit Approved)
      This panel will cover the special problems in patent,
      copyright and tradmark law engendered by computers and digital
      technology, with attention to the impact of recent cases.  The
      differences in European protection will be surveyed as well as
      technology export restrictions.
           Raymond Nimmer, University of Texas Law School
           Leslie A. Bertagnolli, Baker &amp; McKenzie, Chicago
 ^L
      Transactional Data Analyses: Making FOI Access Useful
      Electronic communication, coupled with federal and state
      Freedom of Information Acts, has made a great deal of data
      available to the public regarding the activities and policies
      of government enforcement and regulatory agencies.  Knowing
      how to evaluate and use this information is critical to
      understanding and demonstrating what the data really means.
      The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of
      Syracuse University uses its various knowledge-bases to
      demonstrate the power of transactional data.  Colorgraphics
      and analytic techniques are combined in demonstrations of how
      otherwise drab statistics can be displayed dramatically to aid
      in policy analyses and advocacy.
           David Burnham, former New York Times Investigative
           Reporter;
           Susan Long, Co-director, TRAC, SUNY-Syracuse

      Election Fraud and Modern Technology
      There has been increasing attention, in the U.S. and abroad,
      to the use of modern technology in the electoral process.
      Buying votes, stealing votes, changing votes -- whether in the
      environment of punch-cards or fully automated voting machines
      -- is the subject of this tutorial.  Mock elections will be
      staged in which the participants have roles in planning to
      perpetrate as well as prevent vote fraud.  Voter registration,
      phone-based voting, cryptography and verification are among
      the strategies and technologies to be considered.
      Russel L. Brand, Reasoning Systems.

 SPECIAL EVENTS ON WEDNESDAY, Mar. 23:

 Noon - 4:00 p.m.,  Privacy International Business Meeting
      This meeting, at the John Marshall Law School, begins with a
      buffet luncheon.  Non-members interested in learning about
      P.I. and the Illinois Privacy Council are invited to be guests
      for lunch and a briefing. Guest space will be limited so
      attendance on a "first come" basis MUST be confirmed by

 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m.  Conference Reception
      All CFP registrants are invited to a reception and open house
      demonstrating the John Marshall Law School's recently opened
      computer lab.  This also is an opportunity to "network" the
      old-fashioned way, meeting old friends and making new ones
      while enjoying the reception and buffet. This state-of-the-art
      facility will display information and communications
      technology being used in the educational environment. Guests
      also may participate in hands-on demonstrations of the
      technology under the tutelage of JMLS faculty and staff.

           President, Washington, D.C.

 10:00 a.m. Break

 10:30 a.m.  The Information Superhighway: Politics and the Public
            Internet.
      The Administration and Congress propose policies that will
      lead to a digital multimedia highway.  How can the road be
      built at affordable cost while serving the public interest and
      our constitutional values?
      Chair: Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation


 12:00 p.m.  Lunch
                Speaker: U.S. Senator Paul Simon (Invited)

 1:30 p.m.  Is It Time for a U.S. Data Protection Agency?
      Beginning with the Privacy Act of 1974, proposals to establish
      an oversight body for data protection have been offered but
      not adopted; another proposal is currently pending in
      Congress.  Against a background of almost twenty years
      experience under the Privacy Act, the panel will consider
      whether the current political, economic and technological
      mileau favors establishment of a data protection agency.
      Chair: Priscilla M. Regan, George Mason University

  2:45 p.m.  Break

  3:00 p.m.  "Owning and Operating the NII: Who, How, When?"
      The National Information Infrastructure is an important
      initiative for the present Administration.  This panel will
      explore policy and technical issues such as equity and access,
      connectivity and standards, funding and regulation, privacy
      and security, ownership and operation.
      Chair: Marc Rotenberg, Computer Professionals for Social

  4:15 p.m.  Break

  4:30 p.m.  Data Encryption: Who Holds The Keys?
      Recent attempts, led by federal law enforcment agencies, to
      control the development and dissemination of strong
      cyptography programs has engendered considerable discussion
      and disagreement.  The interests of law enforcement agencies
      may conflict with the need for data security and personal
      privacy demanded by users of electronic networks.  This panel
      will evaluate proposals to deal with the question.
      Moderator: Willis Ware, Rand Corporation

 5:30 p.m. Adjourn

 6:00 p.m.  EFF Awards Reception

 Friday, March 25, 1994.

 8:30 a.m.  Keynote: David Flaherty, Data Protection Commissioner,
            Victoria, British Columbia

 9:15 a.m.  Health Information Policy
      The Clinton Health Reform Plan, and variations on that theme,
      stress the use of information technology to help the
      efficiency and effectiveness of health care.  Expert
      consultation, improved service delivery through new
      technology, and improvements in the processing of health
      insurance claims bring promise of cost cuts as well as the
      possibilities of threats to personal privacy.  This panel of
      experts will form the "CFP Group" to explore these promises
      and threats.
      Chair: Robert R. Belair, Mullenholz &amp; Brimsek, Wash., D.C.

 10:30 a.m.  Break

 10:45 a.m.  Can Market Mechanisms Protect Consumer Privacy?
      When does protection of consumer privacy require legal
      standards and government regulation and when can bargains and
      agreements in the market suffice?  What role do new
      technological options for individuals and organizations play
      in facilitating private choice and market transactions?  Is
      "ownership" of personal information a useful concept or a dead
      end for privacy protection in an information age?
      Chair: Dr. Alan F. Westin, Columbia University

 Noon      Lunch, Speaker: Philip Zimmerman, PGP

 1:30 p.m.  Creating an Ethical Community in Cyberspace
      The fundamental ethical questions posed by the "settlement" of
      cyberspace are not new.  What is new is that the relationship
      between behavior and the ethical conceptions by which we judge
      behavior shift and become more ambiguous and vague.  This
      sessions examines the ethical dilemmas brought about by the
      "colonization" of cyberspace that must be resolved to
      establish and maintain a stable, humane environment.
      Chair: Prof. James Thomas, Northern Ilinois University

 2:45 p.m.  Break

 3:00 p.m.  Standards for Certifying Computer Professionals
      The subject of licensing of computer professionals is
      receiving increased attention by professional organizations
      and by state legislatures.  Both the ACM and IEEE have
      proposals under study, and perhaps a half-dozen states are
      considering licensing bills.  This panel will consider the
      pros and cons and suggest some standards for certification.
      Chair: Donald Gotterbarn, East Tennessee State Univ.

 4:15 p.m.  Break

 4:30 p.m.  Hackers and Crackers: Using and Abusing the Networks
      This session will explore issues surrounding the "fringe" of
      network use.  What can and should be exchanged?  Who will
      monitor "appropriate" use?   What's the current difference, if
      any, between "hacker" and "cracker"?  What should be expected
      and accepted regarding the role of law enforcement agencies?

 5:30 p.m. Adjourn

 5:45 p.m. Buses begin departing for the Chicago Museum of Science
           and Industry for a private reception and demonstration at
           the Communications and Imaging exhibits.

 9:00 p.m.  Buses begin departing for return to the Palmer House and
           Chicago's "Loop."

 Saturday, March 26, 1994

 9:00 a.m.  The Role of Libraries on the Information Superhighway
      As the information landscape changes dramatically the historic
      role of libraries as the "information commons" is challenged.
      How will the Carnegie ideal of free, public access be
      implemented by the library community?  Should it be?  This
      panel will consider policy for an information network in the
      public interest.
      Moderator: Tamara J. Miller, President, Library and
                 Information Technology Association

 10:15 a.m. Break

 10:30 a.m.  International Governance of Cyberspace: New Wine in Old
                Bottles -- Or Is It Time For New Bottles?
      Much discussion transpires between members of the Economic
      Community, the O.E.C.D., the Council of Europe, and the United
      States, regarding data protection, intellectual property
      rights, transborder data flow, the mediation of disputes, etc.
      This panel will consider whether existing mechanisms can solve
      the problems or a new structure for the governance of
      cyberspace is needed.
      Chair:  Ronald L. Plesser, Piper and Marbury

 Noon:  Lunch
           Speaker: Simon Davies, Director General, Privacy
           International

 1:30 p.m. The Electronic Republic: Delivery of Government Services
         over the Information Superhighway
      State and local governments use computer networks to deliver
      a wide range of services and information to the public;
      electronic "kiosks" are moving to "government by ATM."  How
      will this interaction between government and the people affect
      the process of American government in the future?
      Chair: Dennis McKenna, Publisher, "Government Technology."

 2:45 p.m.  Break

 3:00 p.m. Education and NREN, K - 12
      Internetworking is a very new technology being rapidly
      deployed to conventional classrooms, a very old technology.
      The panel will explore the clash of contradictory assumptions
      embedded within these systems -- a clash which has profound
      implications for the future of both the network and the
      classrooom.
      Chair: Steven Hodas, NASA NREN Project
