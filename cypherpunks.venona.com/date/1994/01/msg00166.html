This feels like Detweiler spoofing again. Anyone else get that
feeling?

nobody@pmantis.berkeley.edu says:
&gt; As for the `Szabo being a tentacle thread' in the newsgroups, pmetzger
&gt; just posted stating that he had indeed posted the name of 
&gt; the town Szabo lives in, as well as the names of his roommates.  He refrained
 
&gt; from posting that information again.  I seem to vaguely recall seeing the 
&gt; original post, but can't find it in the buffers here -- everything before 
&gt; December 21st or so has expired. 
&gt;  
&gt;  the thing that ROYALLY PISSES ME OFF is that NOONE WHO HEARD 
&gt; PMETZGER CLAIM THIS has POSTED TO SAY THAT THEY HEARD HIM SAY THAT. 
&gt; reminds me of the infamous rape and murder of that NY woman, with 
&gt; dozens of witnesses hearing her screams, just going about their 
&gt; business. who will be raped next? and who will be silent? everyone who 
&gt; is watching my thread, and being silent about what they know, is a 
&gt; hypocrite and a dangerous accomplice to lies. 
&gt;  
&gt; I guess that's a bit overstated.  I suspect people in most major metropolitan
 
&gt; areas don't want to get involved partially because they fear retribution, and
 
&gt; partially because, with that many people packed together, you tend to care 
&gt; less about your neighbors than you would in a small town, where you know the 
&gt; people in your building or street.  I suspect people on the net don't bother 
&gt; because "it's just bits" -- they read the Net like they watch TV, without any
 
&gt; connection to the characters or dramas unfolding before them.  In large part,
 
&gt; what is said here doesn't really matter.  People get curious, but it's not 
&gt; worth getting into an uproar. 
&gt;  
&gt; if YOU GIVE A DAMN, POST! 
&gt;  
&gt; Ah, there's the rub.  Deep down, I really don't care about this particular 
&gt; issue.  To my knowledge, Nick Szabo, whether real or not, has never said 
&gt; anything that has made me even care whether or not he has real.  I've never 
&gt; found anything he's said particularly interesting.  He's a net.person.  Shoul
d 
&gt; he turn out to be a "tentacle," that's fine by me -- he won't be the first 
&gt; I've encountered.  If he turns out to be T.C.May in disguise, all that means 
&gt; is that there's one less person with T.C.May's ideas in the world than people
 
&gt; thought. 
&gt;  
&gt; I think that uncaring attitude, which I regard as fairly dominant among peopl
e 
&gt; who've used cyberspace (and especially Usenet) a good amount of time, is the 
&gt; very reason that May's ideas about widespread crypto bringing down government
s 
&gt; will never come to pass.  People have, and I believe will continue to have, a
 
&gt; distrust about putting much faith into computers, and thus cyberspace will 
&gt; always have limitations.  I believe people put a great deal of stock in the 
&gt; feel of a crisp paper dollar bill, as well as a smile and a handshake. :-) 
&gt;  
&gt; Perhaps to add more fuel to the fire, a Nicholas Szabo does indeed live in 
&gt; Cupertino, according to a 1990-1991 White Pages from the area.  There is no 
&gt; G.Dale listed, however.  (I was hoping to correlate the two numbers)  I 
&gt; suspect that I need a more recent phone book to make a better test.
