You are cordially invited to participate in a meeting of the above-
referenced work groups of the Information Security Committee on
Wednesday-Thursday, January 19-20, 1994. These interdisciplinary work
groups will continue to address conventional and electronic notarization
and certification authority issues. The meetings are focused around the
work product of its respective participants and will be highly results
driven.

At the last meeting, further progress was made on the development of
"Model Certification Authority Guidelines/Rules of Practice
("Guideline") to provide a legal framework for the use of certificate-
based public key cryptography. Also, proposals were further debated and
developed including for: (i) the creation of a new ABA accreditation/-
specialization "attorney-notary;" (ii) a "Clipper Resolution;" and (iii)
alternative dispute resolution for CAs.

Professor Carl Felsenfeld has secured the use of the Faculty Reading
Room of Fordham Law School in New York City. The meeting agenda and
logistics are attached. I look forward to seeing you in New York.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Baum
Chair, Information Security Committee
  and EDI/IT Division
