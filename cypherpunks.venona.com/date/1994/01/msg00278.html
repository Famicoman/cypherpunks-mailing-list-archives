A Letter from the Editors:
 We are currently compiling information for the new edition of the
Encyclopedia of Associations: National Organizations of the U.S., which
describes more than 20,000 national, nonprofit groups. The Encyclopedia
of Associations is published by Gale Research Inc. (founded 1954).
Complemented by companion volumes International Organizations and
Regional, State and Local Organizations, the Encyclopedia is updated and
revised annually.

The Encyclopedia of Associations, now in its 24th edition, is considered
a standard reference source and is found in libraries throughout the
country. It is used by researchers and market analysts, as well as
individuals looking for groups in a specific field. Critics have hailed
EA as a classic research tool.

We wish to include your organization in this directory and ask that you
complete the questionnaire on the other side. Please return it within 15
days (or as soon as possible). We would also be grateful for any
additional information you could provide, such as lists of parent and
sister organizations with addresses, if possible.

There is no charge or obligation for this or any subsequent listing
in the Encyclopedia of Associations.
