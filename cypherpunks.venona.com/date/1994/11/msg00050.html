&gt;&gt; They're easy to remove.  Just rip the bill diagonally from the edge to
&gt;&gt; the strip on either side of it, and pull the little triangle you just

The plastic strips are not in fives or ones, but are in tens and higher.
All the strip says is USA and give the dollar amount in metallic ink.

What would be interesting to note is whether it is *illegal* to remove the
strips.  I don't think that banks, et al. would seriously refuse to accept
this money as a deposit (or for change, etc.) simply because at the moment
there is too much pre-1991 money floating about, and it would be cumbersome
to check each and every piece of currency.

Then again, I've often tried to get pre-1991 money simply because I do not
wish to deal in post-1991 dollars with strips (humor me) and have been told
by tellers that they have no pre-1991 money.
