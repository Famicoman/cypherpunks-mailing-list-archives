"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and let me remind 
you, moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."
 -- Karl Hess

Meeting in Pasadena (near Los Angeles) CALIFORNIA U-S-A-
Nobody is leaving town because of the meeting this time 8^)
  
              The following text was written by SEK3:
              ---   K A R L   H E S S   C L U B   ---

                 REVOLUTION, REACTION or BETRAYAL?
               A Special 3-Part Post Election Series

1. Monday, November 21, 1994
You are invited to attend our Sixth Meeting,
TRIUMPH OF THE PALEOS?

   Three speakers were invited tonight. The spokesperson for the 
Paleoconservatives, Mr. Steven Piper, who publicly agreed last 
meeting to attend and present his position, decided otherwise after 
election nigbt.
   Meanwhile, the former spokesperson for the anti-voting Movement 
of the Libertarian Left who debated Ted Brown, spokespersons for 
the Dana Rohrbacher candidacy, and Loy Lefevre, also declined to 
attend.
   What does it all mean? Has the Centrist "Libertarian" Party (LP) 
strategy won by default? Does that strategy win anything?
   Should libertarians not only embrace voting, but for 
Republicans, following Rothbard/Rockwell Paleolibs into joining the 
Paleocons behind a Buchanan-run RP? Or have the Paleos already 
pulled up the drawbridge behind them?
   Or should we assume the Right has decisively won -- and all join 
the tattered remnants of the New Left, the new coffee-house 
anarchists, and the non-socialist Left in a last-ditch, die-hard 
defense of what freedoms we can salvage?
   Or...tonight long-time LP activist, holder of many party 
offices, and articulate former editor of the LP's newspaper, Ted 
Brown, recently defeated candidate for California Insurance 
Commissioner and, incidently, one of the LP's biggest vote getters, 
presents the case for The Party.
   At the last minute, Tom Dominy, defeated candidate in a 
Republican primary for Congress, former LP activist, agreed to 
appear on behalf of the Republican Option.

ANARCHIST ALTERNATIVES

...and alternative anarchists. Agorists, Discordians, anarcho-
syndicalists and punks -- cypher and rock. Does "dropping out" of 
the hopeless aboveground political system mean less activism -- or 
more? Is it time to move from the back-room to the coffeehouse? 
- From the conference committee room to the Usenet? Does feminism 
mean sharing the same oppression experienced by most males? Does 
voting for socialism mean bureaucratic capitalism and does voting 
for free enterprise mean profit...for bureaucrats?
   Did you vote for change last month...and get betrayed already? 
Are you ready to get angry...or get even? Or just get something 
done! If so, come and hear our panel of real alternatives: from 
(De)center, IWW, and the new improved and revitalized Movement of 
the Libertarian Left. Find out what's already going on all around 
you.
   At Hasmik's in Cheviot Hills (West L.A.). Make sure you are on 
our mailing list to get the postcard giving you the details!
   Call (310) 289-4126 or send your mail drop to KHC c/o AI, 291 S. 
La Cienega Blvd., #749, Beverly Hills, CA 90211.

"THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 16TH"

What have the Objectivists been up to since the death of Ayn Rand? 
Successors, institutes, new associations...some of whom are 
actually eager to dialog with libertarians and others. Have they 
something new for us to consider? Should we go back to our 
philosophical roots first before wasting more time on inherently 
impossible solutions? Is A still A? On this most special night for 
objectivists, come and find out.
