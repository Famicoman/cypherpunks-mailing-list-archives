   What follows is an advertisement by the Privacy Digest people. These
people have been around longer than 10 years. The information would
seem to be of interest to Cypherpunks. I HAVE PRESENTED THE FOLLOWING
FOR INFORMATION ONLY. I ADVOCATE NO BREAKING OF LAWS.

   Since these people are in Costa Rica, it will take more postage than
U.S. mail. Find out from Post Office how much. It should be less than
twice U.S. postage. Also, I have noticed that these people don't put
return addresses on some of their mail. You might consider doing the
same.
