Some people have kindly sent me email encouraging me to stay. I'm still
vacillating, but thought you might be interested in this. I got this
from the same place that last message came from, a sort of "psychic
exploration" list (also deeply interested in world/government events).
Again, probably from a Fidonet channel originally.

The Virtual Radio Network will host a live press briefing, open to
the public, that will reveal Senate-hopeful Oliver North's million
dollar international arms and drugs smuggling operations out of
Central America into the United States through a covert airstrip
at Mena, Arkansas protected by then Governor Bill Clinton. 

Two high level former government officials have agreed to appear
together in this Virtual Radio Network news making background
briefing to reveal their eyewitness accounts including:

 - Why presidential candidate Clinton would not attack President
Bush's Iran-Contra record.

 - How Bill Clinton protected Oliver North's Iran-Contra weapons
for drugs operation at Mena, Arkansas.

 - Oliver North's direct connections and support of DEA documented
drug smugglers at El Salvador's Illopango airstrip which was used
as a CIA-contra resupply point.

The briefing will be held on Wednesday, July 27th, 7 PM at The
Greenwich Village School, 6th Avenue and 11th Street, Manhattan.
Tickets for the public are $8 to benefit Virtual Radio Network's

Celerino Castillo was the Drug Enforcement Administrations senior
agent in El Salvador from 1985 to 1991. He reported to top federal
officials in 1986 about cocaine flights used to supply the contras
by the "North Network." He told the U.S. ambassador to El
Salvador, Edwin Corr, now retired and teaching at the University
of Oklahoma, and then Vice-President George Bush about the drug
smuggling operation but could get no federal official to act on
his information.

Celerino Castillo and Dave Harmon's, book "Powder Burns" will be
released this summer, by Mosaic Press 1-800-387-8992

Terry Reed, an eight year veteran in U.S. Air Force intelligence
in Southeast Asia. He was recruited by Colonel Oliver North to
train Contra pilots at Mena, Arkansas in an operation named "Jade
Bridge." In 1985, North chose Reed to set up a CIA proprietary,
Maquinaria International, in Mexico to serve as an arms warehouse
and trans-shipment point for weapons. When Reed learned he was
also transmitting cocaine he tried to resign and return to the
U.S. but his life was threatened and a warrant was issued for his
arrest. An FBI/CIA manhunt ensued.  Employing skills learned as an
intelligence officer, Reed and his family fled over a six- month,
30,000 mile odyssey through 48 states. In November 1990 Reed was
acquitted. He has gone to court to seek redress for violations of
his civil rights.
