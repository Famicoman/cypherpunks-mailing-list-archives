&gt;From:  &lt;solman@MIT.EDU&gt;

&gt;You are then quite correct that meet-in-the-middle attacks can be
&gt;done, but the key to the first encryption (the hashing multiplex) is 112
&gt;bits (for the split into two parts version) which would require 2^112
&gt;stored messages, substantially more than could possibly be stored by
&gt;anybody ever (well, I guess ever is a bad word to use in this context).

There are two separate operations here.  One is splitting the plaintext:

	P0, P1 = S_KS(P)

The other is generation of the splitting key.  I assume independent
generation of the splitting key both because it maximizes the total
keyspace and because it avoids the confusion that I believe is evidenced
by the above quoted paragraph.  To wit:  You have suggested generating
the split key with a one-way hash of the DES keys:

	KS = hash(concat(K0,K1))

If the concatenation of the DES keys is 112 bits, then there are 2^112
possible values of the concatenation.  However, the hashing of this
value is not the first of the two encryptions; the splitting of the
plaintext is the first encryption, and the hash is merely a mechanism
for generating the splitting key.  The domain of KS is the determinant
of the size of the intermediate memory in a brute-force
meet-in-the-middle attack.

Furthermore, even for an independently generated splitting key, if the
size of the domain of KS is greater than the size of the domain of K0
or K1, then the DES-decrypted values can be stored as the intertext,
requiring no more memory than that required for decrypting double DES.

&gt;I still believe that the security
&gt;of the scheme, even when just splitting into two parts and using the hash
&gt;of the keys to multiplex the split, is much worse (by more than a couple
&gt;of factors of two) than DES.

I suspect that you mean better, not worse [smiley deleted by censor].
I do not contest this claim, but I consider a more pertinent metric to
be the security of this scheme relative to that of double DES.  One
decomposite of the split+encrypt algorithm can be viewed as:

	C = E_K0(S0_KS(P))

And an analogous double DES encryption is:

	C = E_K0(E_K1(first_half(P)))

For the sake of argument, I'll assume that the domains of KS and K1 are
equal in size.  Thus, a brute-force meet-in-the-middle attack will
require the same number of encryptions and the same amount of memory in
both cases, although the amount of computational power required will be
somewhat less in the case of split+encrypt because the splitting is less
computationally intensive than DES.

However, the splitting algorithm is relatively simple, far more so than
DES.  It is unlikely that a brute-force approach is necessary to
cryptanalyze the splitter.  For example, consider the following
splitting algorithm:

	p0[i] = (p[i+1] &amp; ~key) | (p[i] &amp; key);
	p1[i] = (p[i+1] &amp; key) | (p[i] &amp; ~key);

This is particularly simple, and I chose it to be so for simplicity of
discussion.  Imagine that our cryptanalytic algorithm begins as follows:
Decrypt first block of ciphertext with each possible DES key; check to
see if the resulting intertext could possibly have come from first block
of known plaintext; if so, store the key; continue.  Without looping
through all possible split keys, we can determine whether the intertext
could have come from the plaintext:

precompute:

	bits_in_common = ~(p[0] ^ p[1]);  // ^ = XOR
	must_be_1 = bits_in_common &amp; p[0];
	must_be_0  = bits_in_common &amp; ~p[0];

inside loop:

	if (test_block &amp; must_be_0 | ~test_block &amp; must_be_1)
		test_block could not be from plaintext

This greatly shortens the amount of memory required for the search,
making the algorithm much less secure than double DES.  You may respond
by suggesting improvements to the splitting algorithm, such as
multiple-bit dependency; but there are doubtless other weaknesses that
could be exploited.  I did not spend a lot of time on the above
technique; persons more qualified than I am, devoting serious time to
the problem, will certainly develop better cryptanylitic attacks.  I
think you will be very hard pressed to develop an algorithm anywhere
near as secure as DES.
