&gt;Related note: I was doing some research at the National Library of
&gt;Australia the other day and came across a publication (a 12 page
&gt;pamphlet or thereabouts) titled "Careers for Mathematicians and
&gt;Engineers at the National Security Agency". It's dated about 1976, and
&gt;describes what engineers, physicists, mathematicians and computer
&gt;scientists can engage in at NSA. 

There is a similar information brochure for the DSD, available at most
career advisory services in Australian Universities.

&gt;The people in the pictures look like they had been rescued from a 70's
&gt;low budget CIA or Police TV flick. As for equipment, there were
&gt;pictures of oscilloscopes, `computers' with LEDs and switches on the
&gt;front and other stuff as well (and neat labels on the switches too).

The DSD brochure is interestingly sanitized too.  The surprise was
their acknowledgement that they own a Cray, although the pictured model
is an X-MP (which I know has been subsequently decommissioned, cut in half,
and now graces the CRI foyer in Melbourne and, it is rumored, the DSD
foyer in their HQ at Russell, ACT).  DSD have a more recent model now.
Amusingly, it was not up until recently that they were admitting that they
HAD a Cray, and the current model is still confidential.

The picture also shows some fairly hackerish looking people pointing
logic probes into circuitry, and viewing the output of programs on what
look like 3270 terminals!  On closer inspection, these boards appear to
be domestic modems (Dataplex models, by the look of them).  There is one
fairly interesting looking board, which appears to be covered in ceramic-
packaged custom chips, but it looks circa 1975 or so and ancient.

I went through the document as closely, but could not get much out of it.
The sanitisation was quite competent, which is no surprise for that
organisation.

&gt;Some of the claims are down right funny. For instance, it is stated
&gt;that "To assure maximum opportunity for achievement, the Agency
&gt;provides a high degree of personal freedom to pursue individual
&gt;interests in an atmosphere conducive to scholary achievement". Sure!

*ROTFL!!!!*

Does this include left-wing political interests?!
