			     CRYPTO '94

			General  Information

			 August 21-25, 1994



The program: Crypto '94 is the fourteenth in a series of workshops
on cryptology held at Santa Barbara, California and is sponsored
by the International Association for Cryptologic Research, in
cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Security and Privacy and the Computer Science Department of the
University of California, Santa Barbara. The program for the
workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology.  Formal proceedings
will be provided at the conference.

In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited
by the program committee, there will be a poster session on Monday
evening.  There will also be a rump session on Tuesday evening for
informal presentations.  Facilities will also be provided for
attendees to demonstrate hardware, software and other items of
cryptological interest.  If you wish to demonstrate such items,
you are urged to contact the General Chair so that your needs will
be attended to.  The social program will include hosted cocktail
parties and dinners on Sunday, Monday and the Beach Barbecue on
Wednesday.  These events are included with the cost of
registration.  No evening meals will be provided at the dining
hall.

About the conference facilities:  The workshop will be held on the
campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara.  The campus
is located adjacent to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific
Ocean.  Accommodations are available in the university dormitories
at relatively low cost for  conference participants.  Children
under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the dormitories, so
those bringing small children will need to make separate
arrangements in one of several nearby hotels.  More information on
hotels is enclosed.  Parking on campus is available at no cost to
participants.

Travel information:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles
&gt;from the Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several
airlines, including American, America West, Delta, United and US
Air.  Free shuttle bus service will be provided between the Santa
Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday and Thursday afternoons.
All major rental car agencies are also represented in Santa
Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the
north and Los Angeles from the south.  Santa Barbara is
approximately 100 miles north of the Los Angeles airport, and 350
miles south of San Francisco.

Registration:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but
attendance at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is
strongly advised. To register, fill out the attached registration
form and return to the address on the form along with payment in
full before July 8, 1994.  Campus accommodations will be available
on a first come, first serve basis for attendees who register by
July 8, 1994. Late registrations, subject to a late registration
fee, may be accepted if space is available, but there are no
guarantees.  The conference fees include participation in the
program and all social functions, as well as membership to the
IACR and a subscription to the Journal of Cryptology.  The room
and board charges include dormitory lodging Sunday night through
Wednesday night and breakfast and lunch Monday through Thursday.
Technical sessions will run from Monday morning to Thursday at
noon.  A very limited number of stipends are available to those
unable to obtain funding.  Students whose papers are accepted and
who will present the paper themselves are invited to apply if such
assistance is needed.  Requests for stipends should be sent to the
General Chair before June 3, 1994.

				Hotels


For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the following
is a partial list of hotels in the area.  Those who choose to stay
off campus are responsible for making their own reservations, and
early reservations are advised since August is a popular season in
Santa Barbara.  Note that Goleta is closer to UCSB than Santa
Barbara, but a car will probably be required to travel between any
hotel and the campus.  All prices are subject to change; prices
should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels directly.
However, mention CRYPTO '94 when you are making your reservation
and in several of the hotels you will be eligible for the
university rate which can be significantly less than the normal
rates.  We are not able to block rooms in these hotels, so please
make reservations as early as possible.  The quality of the hotels
range from rather expensive beach-front resorts to basic
inexpensive accommodations.  For further information, try
