catalyst-remailer@netcom.com:
&gt; A quick review of the patent stigmata:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been reading some fascinating interpretations of these and 
&gt; &gt; other prophecies lately.
&gt; 
&gt; Frequent Biblical allusions, particularly fond of apocalyptic references.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;                    I think your cause for privacy would actually be
&gt; &gt; *advanced* by promoting an ID *card* under the following condition:
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to mask underlying obsession with veneer of rationality.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyone can obtain as many ID cards as they want.
&gt; 
&gt; Fixation on multiple personalities (tentacles, "pseudo-anonymity").

But she doesn't demonstrate the maniacal hatred for multiple
pseudonyms that LD did.  In fact, she's supporting them.

&gt; &gt; Before you accuse me of heresy, consider the system of email address
&gt; &gt; privacy that was championed earlier by Perry Metzger: you can get any 
&gt;  [ and later ]
&gt; &gt; Well, I do not appreciate threats in my mailbox such as "Go away--I'm not
&gt; &gt; as gentle as Perry Metzger". I can't believe how torqued-up all you guys
&gt; &gt; are. This mailing list is like a firing range.
&gt; 
&gt; Frequent mention of Perry Metzger.
&gt; Standard unit of torment: Perry Metzger.

Someone sent the mail she mentions.  I think that it was an excellent
example of 'extreme go-away mail'.  It's not her fault that the person
who sent the most militant message of paranoia mentioned pmetzger.

I don't think the few mentions of him in what she has posted have
exceeded normal levels.

&gt; &gt; system with government? Or do you just want to get rid of governments,
&gt; &gt; and use "privacy" as the reason? Yikes.
&gt; 
&gt; Tireless apologist and supporter of government.

This sounds like what an average person would say if you showed them
messages saying things like 'the reason I like crypto is that it's a
hammer with which to smash the State.'  She doesn't sound like a
'tireless apologist and supporter'; she sounds like a non-anarchist.

&gt; &gt; People, you may successfully get me to lose this account for no reason.
&gt; 
&gt; Paranoia never far below the surface.

She's telling the truth.  She's recognizing the reality that if a
couple of hundred people complain about her being LD, it's likely that
support@netcom is likely to terminate her account with extreme
prejudice, without listening to her insistence that she's not.

I don't think that's paranoid.  Do you?

Kragen
