&gt;        -public testimony,
&gt;        -reply letters from the legislator,
&gt;        -stated positions from their office,

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;STATUS OF THE BILL (updated 7/18/94)
&gt;
&gt;The Cantwell bill HR3627, that allows for fewer restrictions on exports
&gt;of cryptography, was rolled into the General Export Administration Act
&gt;HR 3937.  The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the full strength
&gt;version out of committee after open, public hearings.  The House
&gt;Intelligence Committee took the bill and gutted it after a day of
&gt;closed, secret hearings.  The gutted version will come to the House
&gt;floor on Wednesday July 20th.
&gt;
&gt;A amendment that reinstates Rep. Maria Cantwell's cryptography export
&gt;provisions WILL be offered.  It is crucial that you ensure that your
&gt;representative knows that you support ONLY the amended version of this
&gt;bill.
&gt;
&gt;This may be the last thing you can do for the cryptographic export
&gt;legislation.  Take the time to make a call!
&gt;
&gt;Schedule/Chronology of the bill
&gt;Jul 20, 94  HR3937 comes to House floor; a "good" amendement will be offered

&gt;
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW
&gt;
&gt;Estimated time to do this good deed: Six minutes
&gt;
&gt;Your legislator needs to know that you want them to support HR3937
&gt;but only with an amendment including Rep. Maria Cantwell's cryptography
&gt;export provisions.
&gt;
&gt;If you wish to fax a letter instead of calling, that's fine too.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't know who your representative is, call:
&gt;
&gt;        -The League of Women Voters in your area, or
&gt;        -Any representative from your state.  They will tell you which
&gt;         is yours.
&gt;
&gt;You can obtain a complete copy of all representatives by:

&gt;
&gt;        Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,
&gt;
&gt;        On Wed. July 20th, HR 3937 (General Export Administration Act)
&gt;        comes to the floor.  Please support HR3937 but only with an
&gt;        amendment including Rep. Maria Cantwell's cryptography export
&gt;        provisions.  These provisions are crucial to the development of
&gt;        privacy-enhancing technology as the competitiveness of the
&gt;        American cryptographic industry.
&gt;
&gt;        Sincerely,
&gt;

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;What is the Cantwell bill?
&gt;
&gt;The Cantwell bill would permit companies to export products with
&gt;encryption technology in them.  US companies are currently
&gt;not permitted to export products (hardware or software) with this
&gt;technology in them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What is encryption technology?
&gt;
&gt;Encryption technology, or cryptography, is the art of scrambling
&gt;a conversation so that only the people communicating can decode
&gt;it.  Other people (such as eavesdroppers) cannot learn about
&gt;the conversation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Where is cryptography being used?
&gt;
&gt;Cryptography is used to encrypt electronic mail to protect its confidentiality
&gt;in transit.  It's used by bank automatic teller machines to protect
&gt;sensitive data (such as your account number, your Personal Identification
&gt;Number, and your bank balance).  It can be implemented into software
&gt;(such as electronic mail programs and word processors) as well as hardware
&gt;(such as telephones and "walkie-talkies") to ensure your privacy.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Why is there a restriction on exporting products with technology
&gt;in them?
&gt;
&gt;For many years the United States poured vast sums of money into
&gt;cryptography.  The US government thought that if they did not let this
&gt;technology be exported, foreign individuals would not be able to obtain
&gt;it and use it against us (by keeping US intelligence agencies from
&gt;eavesdropping on their communications)
&gt;
&gt;Today, many companies selling cryptographic technology are producing
&gt;their products for the global market.  A recent Software Publishers'
&gt;Association Report (available from the VTW gopher) identified over 200
&gt;non-US companies producing cryptographic technology in the global
&gt;marketplace.  You can buy the same, high-quality cryptographic
&gt;technology from many international firms despite the US export
&gt;regulations.  Although the marketplace has changed, the regulations
&gt;have not.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Why should the regulations be changed?
&gt;
&gt;US companies compete in a global marketplace.  Because of the export
&gt;regulations, they often compete alongside products with superior
&gt;cryptographic capabilities built into them.
&gt;
&gt;The result is that US companies build their products with
&gt;an inferior encryption technology.  The result of this is that
&gt;you, as an American consumer, have great difficulty obtaining
&gt;products with strong encryption in them.
&gt;
&gt;Because US products cannot compete against products with better
&gt;privacy features, and because the laws are outdated, the regulations
&gt;should be changed.  The Cantwell bill fixes these regulations to more
&gt;accurately resemble the current situation of the world marketplace.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;How can I help encourage more privacy-enhanced products and
&gt;pass the Cantwell bill?
&gt;
&gt;Call or write your representative and ask them to support or cosponsor
&gt;Rep. Cantwell's export provisions (formerly HR 3627) in the General
&gt;Export Administration Act, HR 3937.  You can base your letter on the
&gt;sample communication below.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL
&gt;
&gt;The Honorable ____________
&gt;address
&gt;Washington DC, 20515
&gt;
&gt;Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,
&gt;
&gt;As a citizen concerned for my privacy, as well as a supporter of
&gt;American business, I urge you to cosponsor the Rep. Cantwell's
&gt;cryptographic export provisions (formerly HR 3627) in the General
&gt;Export Administration Act, HR 3937.
&gt;
&gt;The bill would allow US companies to produce and export products with
&gt;cryptographic privacy-enhancing technology in them.  These products
&gt;are already available from firms throughout the world.  US companies
&gt;lose nearly $100 million per year in exports to them.
&gt;
&gt;By encouraging this industry, ordinary citizens like you and me would
&gt;be able to purchase products with better privacy features.
&gt;
&gt;Please support or co-sponsor HR 3937.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
