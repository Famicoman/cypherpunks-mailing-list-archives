This would be a good conference to submit a paper for.  Our own Peter
Honeyman chairs the program committee, and David Chaum is also on the
committee.  All that's needed on Monday is an extended abstract, not a
real paper (yet).

                    Announcement and Call for Submissions

                    USENIX Winter 1995 Technical Conference
                              January 16-20, 1995
                            New Orleans, Louisiana

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS 

The USENIX Winter 1995 Technical Conference in New Orleans will be the only
broad-theme USENIX conference in 1995.  The emphasis for the USENIX Winter
1995 Conference is on state-of-the-art practice and research in personal,
distributed, and enterprise computing.

We seek original and innovative papers about the architecture and performance
of modern computing systems.  We are especially interested to hear reports on
practical experiences with such systems.  Of particular interest are such
topics as:

*  privacy and cryptography
*  personal digital assistant applications
*  enterprise-scale computing
*  kernelized operating systems
*  user interface toolkits
*  standards-based computing environments
*  file systems and mass storage
*  nomadic and wireless computing
*  shared address spaces

DATE FOR REFEREED PAPER SUBMISSIONS

  Manuscripts or Extended Abstracts Due:              July 18, 1994
  Notification to Authors:                          August 31, 1994
  Camera-ready Papers Due:                        November 14, 1994

The USENIX conference, like most conferences and journals, requires that papers
not be submitted simultaneously to more than one conference or publication and
that submitted papers not be previously or subsequently  published elsewhere.
Papers accompanied by so-called "non-disclosure  agreement" forms are not
acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread.  All submissions are
held in the highest confidentiality prior to publication in the Proceedings,
both as a matter of policy and in accord with the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976
(Title 17, U.S. Code, Section 102).

HOW TO SUBMIT A REFEREED PAPER

It is important that you contact the USENIX Association office to receive
detailed guidelines for submitting a paper to the refereed track of the
technical sessions; please telephone to +1-510-528-8649 or E-mail to
winter95authors@usenix.org

In addition, specific questions about submissions to the USENIX Winter 1995
Conference may be made to the program chair via E-mail at honey@citi.umich.edu.

The program committee will review full papers or extended abstracts.  An
extended abstract should be 5 manuscript pages (single-sided) or fewer in
length.  It should represent the paper in "short form."  Please include the
abstract as it will appear in the final paper.  If the full paper has been
completed, it may be submitted instead of an extended abstract.  Full papers
should be limited to 12 single-spaced pages.

Include references to establish that you are familiar with related work, and,
where possible, provide detailed performance data to establish that you have a
working implementation and measurement tools.

Every submission should include one additional page or separate E-mail message
containing:
*  the name of one of the authors, who will act as the contact for the program
   committee
*  contact's surface mail address, daytime and evening telephone numbers,
   E-mail address, and FAX number
*  an indication of which, if any, of the authors are full-time students
