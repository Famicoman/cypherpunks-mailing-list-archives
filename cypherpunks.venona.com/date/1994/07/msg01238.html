&gt; Most of the time-space tradeoffs that I can think of for a basic MITM

&gt; could also do some hashing to save space at the cost of false positives
&gt; and more time.  Again, the point is not so much that double DES is weak,
&gt; but more that if its strength is solely due to space costs that gives much

&gt; in space and in time.

Agreed, Hal.  I was just pointing out the fallacy of saying that 2-DES
would only take *TWICE* as long to break as 1-DES.  While there are some
tradeoffs that trade space for time, the one virtually constant factor is
monetary cost. Whether it's 300 million drives running for 10+ days to crack
the key, or 10 million for a year or so, the total energy consumed will be
virtually the same. By my calculations, the energy costs alone would be over
half a billion dollars per key.  Not only that, but one of these
hypothetical $1.5 TRILLION "monster crackers" can still only break 30 keys a
year.  (Good reason to generate temporary session keys!)
 
Also, I neglected the "overhead" costs associated, such as periodic
maintenance on all those drives.  Drives in nearly constant use will need
frequent maintenance, especially head cleaning, which is not a trivial task
on 300 million drives.

The only way I can see that this would be cost-effective is to locate it
near a prison (for cheap convict labor) with a cheap power source nearby.
That, or invent a cheaper storage medium than DAT.

In the final analysis, though, you're right.  I'd hate to calculate the cost
to break 3-DES.  Unless you're encrypting a high speed data link in real
time, where utmost throughput is essential, I see no reason to not use that,
or something equally strong.
