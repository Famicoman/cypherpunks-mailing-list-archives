&gt; &gt; &gt; Wormholes, reversible computation, the 7,000-Cray NSA computer, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems with nanotech, the problems with AI, the Tines and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Powers, the Extropians group (Vernor was curious), the Singularity,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the implications of the OJ Simpson case were a few of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; topics. (Yes, several of us had "wasted" our time watching this
&gt; &gt; &gt; case. Me, I think it's drama of truly Shakespearean proportions, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; should not be "dissed" just becuase it's getting more attention than
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Rhwandans and Haitians are getting...not to mention the boring
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bosnians.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did Vinge have anything of interest to the list to say that you could 
&gt; &gt; pass on?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wes thu hal,
&gt; &gt; Al Billings
&gt; 
&gt; Al is not the only person to ask.
&gt; 
&gt; I mentioned the topics we talked about. But he did not speak in
&gt; Zarathustra-like aphorisms. Nothing specific to quote, as he wasn't
&gt; giving a lecture and we weren't taking notes.
&gt; 
&gt; He's working on a sequel to "A Fire Upon the Deep," is writing a story
&gt; set deep in the Slow Zone (the Oprah Zone?), and is getting a lot of
&gt; publisher attention. 
&gt; 
&gt; He had some funny things to say about San Diego State, where he
&gt; teaches in the CS department. Ironically, there was a "cyberpunk"
&gt; conference held there, and VV was not invited (or was overlooked) So
&gt; Bear and Brin, friends of his, kept asking pointedly, "Where's
&gt; Vernor?"
&gt; 
&gt; On the Singularity, I've already said a fair amount.
&gt; 
&gt; He was very interested to hear about the Cypherpunks--he said he'd
&gt; gotten some articles forwarded to him. He may attend the September
&gt; meeting by M-BONE...Eric Hughes plans to contact Phil Karn to see if a
&gt; San Diego hookup is possible for that meeting. (The September meeting,
&gt; as we discussed at the CP meeting on Saturday, will be a special recap
&gt; of progress, the Second Anniversary meeting.)
&gt; 
&gt; This is all I can write for now. Oh, I made it clear to him on several
&gt; occasions just how important "True Names" was to the formation of my
&gt; own ideas about crypto anarchy (I first discovered it in a
&gt; passed-around Xerox samizdat in 1986).
