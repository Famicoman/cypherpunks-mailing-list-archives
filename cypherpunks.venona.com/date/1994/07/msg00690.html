&gt;&gt;If you read the "Snake Oil" section of the PGP User's Guide, then you
&gt;&gt;know how I feel about amateur cryptographer's encryption algorithms
&gt;&gt;that have not been subjected to extensive peer review.
 
&gt;Well, It is true that I am _not_ being paid for this software. It
&gt;is my hobby. And I don't care how you feel about my hobby.
&gt;Please feel free to make any constructive comments about the
&gt;algorithm.
 
The time for constructive comments about a new algorithm such as
yours is *before* you release code.  IDEA and RSA were already
well respected ciphers before PGP was released.

&gt;I believe that you may by misinformed.  I hope that I have made my
&gt;position clear. You relesased the pgp program under the "Copyleft"
&gt;License. I have the right to change the software or use pieced of it.
&gt;I am protected from you trying to deny me those rights.
 
You may be correct in that Phil Zimmermann has no legal
recourse, but I counldn't say for sure.  I am more concerned
with the ethical issues.  What have you called your new
super-duper pgp?  If you make it abundantly clear that it is
*your* hack of pgp, and not supported in any way by RSA, MIT, or
prz, I personally wouldn't have a problem with it.

It is my feeling that cryptographic software is an entirely
different beast from other software released under such free
licenses.  If I improve or port some one's mail reader for
instance, out of *common courtesy*, the first thing I would do
is contact the author to let him know.  Any bugs in such a
program would make themselves readily apparent and users would
quickly learn whether or not my version was really an
improvement.  How is a user to know that his data has less of a
chance of being compromised using super-kool-pgp than prz's own
version?  The people reading his compromised mail certainly
aren't going to tell him that his cryptographic software has a
bug in it.

I think a lot of this issue has less to do with the law and more
to do with courtesy to fellow software authors.
