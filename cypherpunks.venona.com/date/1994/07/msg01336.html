&gt; 
&gt; REMOTE CONTROL--In addition to denying access to your files by
&gt; encrypting, you might want to *change* them in some way *after*
&gt; your computer has been seized/stolen.  Pagers are cheap.  They
&gt; can be pinged no matter where they are located in their service
&gt; area.  They can be accessed from any phone (even a jailhouse
&gt; payphone).  And they are small enough to be wired into your
&gt; computer.  It souldn't be too difficult to fix it so your
&gt; computer can read transmitted numbers from the pager's memory.
&gt; Code numbers could be used to tell your computer to take various
&gt; actions.  Depending upon your circumstances, you could tell your
&gt; computer to decrypt this or that set of files, to reformat the
&gt; hard drive, to fry the CPU, etc.
&gt;
This would of course assume that the police were silly enough to
use the disk and such from your machine in your machine. From my 
experience w/ Mentor and Erik Blookaxe during Operation Sun Devil this
is not very realistic. As I understand it they took the floppies and the
hard drives out of the original machines and used them on their own. This
was in case their was any 'time-bombs' installed. Another aspect would
be that the machine would have to be turned on. Also it would only work
once. Thereafter they would either examine the equipment in a Farady Cage
or else start doing pager rental scans prior to seizure.

&gt; LITTLE BROTHER INSIDE--Even better than a pager, would be a cell
&gt; phone.  It would be more expensive, but also more versatile.  In
&gt; addition to giving instructions to your computer, a cell phone
&gt; could be used to *eavesdrop* on the location where your computer
&gt; is being held.  By disabling the ringer and remounting the
&gt; mouthpiece, you could surreptitiously call your computer, any
&gt; time, from any phone and monitor conversations in the area.  (To
&gt; paraphrase an old military curse, "bug the bugging buggers.")  As
&gt; long as the computer is plugged in, the cell phones batteries
&gt; will continue to be topped off.  (For the truly thorough privacy
&gt; advocate, a GPS unit could be hooked into the cell phone to give
&gt; you its location.)
&gt;
There is a move here in Austin, TX to put GPS rcvrs. in our police cars
and then transmit the data back to base over their laptop channels.
