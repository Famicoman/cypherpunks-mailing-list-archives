&gt;Well here are the answers that I'm working with in my model:

&gt;First, what you set up has to work off-line. At the same time, validation,
&gt;by its very nature, is a process that can only be accomplished online. The
&gt;part of my code that I am in the middle of right now (and strugling with)
&gt;uses a distributed dynamic hashing scheme (with some attempt at periodic
&gt;space minimalization [this is what is making it tricky]) whereby information
&gt;is recorded in the public system such that if one part of a bill is used
&gt;twice, the cheat's identity is revealed.
&gt;[...]
&gt;For types of small transactions that will be executed frequently, the
&gt;best idea is to establish accounts. In my system, when ever an agent
&gt;enters somebody else's computer, it gives the local wizard (the agent
&gt;with the final say on computational cycles, storage space, and
&gt;communications) a deposit which neither the agent nor the wizard can
&gt;cash without agreement by both [do public validation and recording
&gt;but hold off on the last steps which allow the wizard to use the money].
&gt;The money is thus recorded globally as having been spoken for. Then, for
&gt;all transactions on the local machine, the agent simply uses its local
&gt;account, just as anybody would in a much simpler bank-based protocol,
&gt;like the ones we have now.

This seems like a good approach for a lot of cases.  You end up having
three classes of transactions: small, medium, and large, with slightly
different strategies for each.  For large, you do on-line checking; for
medium, you detect double-spending after the fact and use crypto to find
his identity; and for small you set up an account and dip into that a bit
at a time.  I am curious about whether you are focussing more on some size range
in your plans.

One problem I still see is the small transaction where you don't tend to
use the same provider again and again.  On the net there are a few sites
(well, quite a few, I suppose) which are heavily used, but there are a
lot of places I might like to just browse through.  Paying a penny per
site isn't going to bother me much, but if I have to set up an account
for each one ahead of time I'm probably not going to bother.  So I still
think there are problems with the fractional-cent-per-web-site model
which I have been hearing about.

&gt;I don't agree on this point. I prefer license based e-cash which is modified
&gt;on each transaction (and unfortunatelly gets slightly bigger -- the downside
&gt;of this method). If we're going to make the conversion to ecash, we might
&gt;as well make it as powerful as mathematics will allow.

Is this an approach where you determine to whom you will be sending the cash,
then make it into a "check" which can only be spent by that recipient?
Doesn't that require the bank's (cash issuer's) help?  Or is this something
else?
