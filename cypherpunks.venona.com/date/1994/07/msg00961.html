&gt; &gt;Nonetheless, your cryptanalytic algorithm makes clear an additional
&gt; &gt;constraints that must be placed on the system which I had not realized:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the algorithm, the plaintext, and the cypher text, in must not be
&gt; &gt;possible to reconstruct both the plaintext, and the cyphertext for either
&gt; &gt;half of the message.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;To that end I would suggest the improvement of making the splitting
&gt; &gt;operation dependent on the keys.
&gt; 
&gt; For that matter, one could have a third key which is used by the
&gt; splitting algorithm.  If one chooses to make this splitting key a
&gt; function of the two DES keys, then this approach reduces to your
&gt; suggestion, at the expense of a smaller keyspace.  It could be said
&gt; that, in the code fragment of my previous message, the splitting key
&gt; is fixed at 0x55555555.
&gt; 
&gt; So now the meet-in-the-middle attack regains its earlier applicability:
&gt; A known-plaintext attack would encrypt P with the splitter, decrypt
&gt; C0 with DES, and attempt to meet in the middle to discover key K0;
&gt; similarly, decrypting with C1 to get K1.

I don't believe this is true. You have C0 and C1, but you can not figure
out P0 and P1 without the hash of the concatenation of both keys. Without
this you can not do a meet in in the middle attack, right?

BTW, after thinking about things, I would modify my earlier design in
one way:

Don't concatenate the negation of the two key hash to the hash. The
point of that step was to split the cipher into two equal sized parts,
but there is no reason to require that. In fact the possibility of
different sized parts would add to the confussion. (The probability
of an extreme imbalance in the size of the ciphers is extremelly
small.)

&gt; If you can design a splitter
&gt; that is as cryptographically secure as DES (good luck), then the
&gt; resulting algorithm is as secure as double DES.

I think that multiplexing based on the hash of the concatenated keys
is as secure as the one way hash function is, no?

&gt; In your previous message, you commented:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have a hunch that if I'm wrong, its because the time required to do secure
&gt; &gt;non-redundant secret splitting is as large as the time I'm saving.
&gt; 
&gt; If your secret-splitting algorithm is as secure as DES, then it probably
&gt; runs as slowly as DES does, making your hunch correct.  However, even if
&gt; this were not the case, the security of this scheme is significantly less
&gt; than that of triple DES.

Well I don't believe that this is the case, but there is one way to find out
:). I believe that for messages longer than a couple of K, my algorithm
provides substantially more security than its DES analog and is quicker.
I'll write up a version of this that splits into 4 parts and post it here
some time over the next week. I think that splitting into four parts should
be about as quick as double DES while providing substantially more security
than triple DES (which I will time it against).

The question of the security of the split is difficult to resolve so I would
like some help with it. Is multiplexing based on the hash of the concat of
the keys as secure as the hash?

Cheers,

Jason W. Solinsky
