&gt; "Crypto-weak" as opposed to "crypto-strong", cryptographically strong.
&gt; The guy was testing BSD random(), which I think is Yet Another Linear
&gt; Congruential Generator.  If you think an LC PRNG has cryptographic
&gt; relevance, you are gravely mistaken.
&gt;
For top of the line crypto, you are absolutely correct. For a learning
resource, I disagree.

&gt; What's so hard about "crypto-related"?  If you can't think of any
&gt; relationship between the articles and cryptography (technical,
&gt; social, political, whatever), don't forward them.  If they had been
&gt; about cryptoanalysis of random(), that might be relevant, though
&gt; hardly ground-breaking.
&gt;
The concept of testing a RNG's stabilty and operating characteristics
is something which is directly crypto related. Much more so than pedophilia
or alt.whatever.rainbow.......

&gt; &gt; Yes, I could do that if I were so inclined. I am not.
&gt; 
&gt; So I see.  You're not willing to take it upon youself to mail copies
&gt; to people who can't otherwise get them, but you're happy to inflict
&gt; irrelevant material straight out of Knuth on people who could easily
&gt; get it themselves.  What *is* your rationale here?
&gt; 
To help those who don't have access to this material other than through
e-mail. And no I am not going to create a list of people and manualy
setup some form of sub-list to filter this stuff according to each 
individuals interest. I don't have the interest, time, or the information
on each and every  member of c-punks to carry this out. 
&gt; &gt; The bottem line is it was crypto related, was in reference to source code,
&gt; &gt; and therefore fit the charter of this group.
&gt; 
&gt; Source code, yes.  Would you like to explain its relationship to crypto?
&gt; 
RNG's are commenly used in crypto, to understand the more compicated techniques
one must learn the more mundane basics.

My main rationale is that while I see lots of people making suggestions I dont
see any of them actually carrying it out. In the whole time I have been on 
this list I have *never* seen referals to the newsgroups. I have seen a 
general trend to repost this material so that people simply have it right 
then and there instead of having to send a sub-group  roaming around looking
for it. Seems a much more labor saving system.
