I neglected to cc: the list on this reply to David Rees, and he was
kind enough to send me back the message so I could post it here.

This is me speaking:

&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I'm just misunderstanding the point David Rees is making:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    Of course, as several people pointed out, there are a large number
&gt; &gt; of ways to break even in roulette.  So if you have bad money that
&gt; &gt; needs laundered, why not bet evenly on red and black each time.  Or even
&gt; &gt; easier, buy 10,000 dollars worth of chips and then cash them in immediately.
&gt; &gt; New and different money on demand.
&gt; &gt;    I get the impression though that I am missing something in the
&gt; &gt; discussion since no one has mentioned something like this and that merely
&gt; &gt; replacing the money isn't the objective here.
&gt; 
&gt; No, converting one wad of, say, $100,000 into another wad of $100,000
&gt; is not the goal.
&gt; 
&gt; Let us suppose "Hillary" (much more interesting than our usual
&gt; cryptographic stand-in, Alice) want to be able to spend $100,000 given
&gt; to her by a friend at Tyson Foods in exchange for regulatory favors. 
&gt; 
&gt; He gives her a wad of $100,000. She takes this wad to Las Vegas (or,
&gt; now, to the nearby Mississippi River gambling boats) and "exchanges"
&gt; it. What has been accomplished? Nothing, except the comparatively
&gt; trivial change in serial numbers (which _can_ be an issue if the bills
&gt; are marked, as in a sting, but this is rarely an issue).
&gt; 
&gt; This is a _kind_ of money laudering, as is literally running currency
&gt; through washer-dryer cycles (yes, this is done), but this is not the
&gt; common meaning of "laundering," and the one which we're focussing on here.
&gt; 
&gt; No, one of the main goals of money-laundering is to make the
&gt; bribe/whatever money appear to be "legitimately earned," so that taxes
&gt; may be paid on it (yes) and the money then used for other investments,
&gt; buying houses, etc. "Legitimately earned" can mean won in Las Vegas,
&gt; or in cattle futures, etc. Hence the schemes here.
&gt; 
&gt; (In Hillary's case, suddenly having $100K that the IRS and other
&gt; agencies can find no "paper trail" for would be evidene of bribery,
&gt; for example. I suppose Hillary could claim it came out of her
&gt; mattress, where she'd been saving money for years, but I doubt this
&gt; would fly.)
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. casinos are closely watched for this kind of thing, of course. I
&gt; wonder if the IRS looks suspiciously at money won at the casinos on
&gt; Paradise Island, Bahamas? Or elsewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; And, germane to our list, the "Internet Casino" that Nick Szabo and
&gt; others have talked about someday building.
