more paranoid than I like to get....

___ 
&gt; Did anyone ever think that maybe, just maybe, PGP was developed, and before the
&gt; programmer started giving it away for free, that he was paid by the government
&gt; to give them the key which can unlock ANY PGP locked document/file/etc???  I
&gt; mean, wasn't it kind of surprising that the government would make such a big
&gt; deal over this?  To make hackers/phreakers in general think that this was the
&gt; greatest encryption scheme available today for free (the programmer was paid 
&gt; to distribute his software for free, seeing that the sum was sizable), they 
&gt; made an act by (i don't know the specifics) arresting him, telling him to stop
&gt; distributing, etc... Makes you wonder huh... It's possible.  Maybe he wrote in
&gt; the PGP program a loophole in the encryption so that he could decrypt anything
&gt; that was encrypted by PGP.  Maybe he is big brother.  Maybe big brother is
&gt; running him... I mean, has anyone ever gone thru the entire source code and 
&gt; checked if this PGP is a valid encryption scheme, or just the gov't slipping
&gt; in their clipper thing without us knowing it.  Reply here--no email please...
