Greetings all,

This was forwarded to me from  rec.video.sat. Does anyone  know any
concrete details about the CC decoders installed in televisions?

			-Ophir
|  -------------------------------------------------------
|
| &gt;   ...  Here is some
| &gt; important information about the use of televisions.
| &gt;
| &gt; In an effort to gain access to the homes of millions of Americans,
| &gt; the FBI, CIA, and NSA have collaborated on a scheme which will
| &gt; finally bring to fruition George Orwell's nightmare scenario.
| &gt;
| &gt; American citizens will be the unwitting accomplices in this plan
| &gt; as they purchase new televisions and bring them into their
| &gt; livingrooms and *bedrooms*.  I'm speaking of the CC decoders that
| &gt; have secretly been mandated by law.  These decoders supposedly
| &gt; provide captions to TV shows for the hearing impaired, but in
| &gt; fact they are also rebroadcasters which will allow the gov.
| &gt; to spy on anyone they want.
| &gt;
| &gt; The television already comes with everything necessary to be
| &gt; a spying apparatus.  Speakers are essentially no different than
| &gt; microphones and therefore can be used to pick up sounds in the
| &gt; room.  The infrared eye which detects the remote control
| &gt; signal also receives an infrared picture of the room, especially
| &gt; detecting heat sources like people.  Thus, all that is needed is
| &gt; a way of gathering this information and relaying it to the government.
| &gt; The little understood "Decoder" is the solution.
| &gt;
| &gt; The congress has recently passed a Law (in virtual secrecy)
| &gt; that requires all new TV's to have the "Decoder."  This is
| &gt; claimed to be for the benefit of deaf people but that is
| &gt; obviously a smoke screen.
| &gt;
| &gt; How we know the congressional law mandating the "Decoder" is not
| &gt; for the deaf:
| &gt;         1) Legitimate CC decoders are already available for TV's.
| &gt;         2) The law doesn't cover other things, like telephones,
| &gt;            which are obviously in the same situation w.r.t. the deaf.
| &gt;         3) There is no law requiring that shows even be broadcast with
| &gt;            closed captions, only that the TV have the "Decoder".
| &gt;
| &gt; Clearly we see that there is no real justification for mandating
| &gt; decoders other than for gathering intelligence.
| &gt;
| &gt; How to deal with the decoder:  simply removing the decoder will not
| &gt; be an option because it will undoubtedly be integrated in such a way
| &gt; that the television will not function without it.  Also, if you open
| &gt; the TV to get at it, you will void the warrenty and then when you
| &gt; get it fixed, they will just replace the "Decoder" without telling.
| &gt;
| &gt; The best way to avoid the "Decoder" is to avoid it by not buying any
| &gt; new TV's.  This will be made difficult by the predictable introduc-
| &gt; tion of High Definition Television soon after the "Decoders" are
| &gt; on line.  In this way you will be forced to buy a new TV because the
| &gt; old one will not get HDTV.  When HDTV is made a standard by the govern-
| &gt; ment, the old style sugnal will not be allowed to be broadcast on the
| &gt; grounds that it interferes with the HDTV.  This is all to force people
| &gt; to buy new TV's with the "Decoder".
| &gt;
| &gt; When you find yourself with a TV equipped with the "Decoder" there
| &gt; are several things you can do to protect yourself.  First, don't
| &gt; put the TV in your bedroom, this is where the government is most
| &gt; interested in spying.  When not watching, push the antennas all the
| &gt; way in or disconnected the cable.  Unplugging the TV will not help
| &gt; because the "Decoder" will use passive broadcasting to continue
| &gt; sending its signal.  Also turn the volume down when not watching.
| &gt; When you watch the TV, place a candle or other heat source to confuse
| &gt; the infrared EYE.  Don't say anything secret or get undressed near
| &gt; the TV.  Don't be seen smoking near the TV.
| &gt;
