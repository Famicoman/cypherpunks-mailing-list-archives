    Every member of the United States House of Representatives and
Senate are this week being delivered an ultimatum that demands that each
of them personally take the initiative to revoke unconstitutional
legislation and initiate an inquiry into Waco.	A copy of the Ultimatum
follows in the next message.

    All MILITIA units will convene in Washington, D.C. the second full
week that the Congress is in session in September to enforce this
mandate and to deliver copies of the Declaration of Indpendence to the
Whitehouse.

    All units will be armed and prepared to enforce this mandate.  This
is exactly what it sounds like.

   **NOTE:  MILITIA UNITS MUST WEAR IDENTIFYING INSIGNIA AND BE ARMED.
If you are armed and wear a military insignia identifying you as a
member of a military unit, if captured, you must be treated as a
Prisoner of War, not as a criminal arrestee, by law.

    We have five months to get in shape and be prepared to restore this
country's liberty.  Mentally and physically, we must be ready, willing,
and able, to do the job.

    I have personally signed the ultimatum to be delivered to Congress,
as John Hancock said, in handwriting so large that the King cannot
mistake my identity.  No other persons are or will be identified,
however, please feel free to copy and issue the ultimatum to Congress
yourself.

    A copy of the ultimatum follows in the next message.

    Additionally, a signed Declaration of Independence will be delivered
to the White House on the day the militia convenes in Washington, D.C.
in September, very likely with millions of signatures.

    Below the initial 100 signers' names which are affixed on the
original, we will attach every page of signatures obtained between now
and September.	Please circulate the Declaration of Independence and
obtain signatures throughout the country through every means possible
and return to AJF, 3850 S. Emerson Ave., Suite E, Indianapolis, IN
46203.

    We will be airdropping this information throughout the country and
distributing it through churches, gun shows, etc.  All national media
have been provided copies as well.

    Please distribute all pages of the Militia Alert, Ultimatum, and
Declaration of Independence everywhere.	 Make thousands of copies.  Put
them out in grocery stores, wherever you can think of.

    More pilot volunteers, printers, and funding for the distribution of
the Declaration of Independence are needed.

    Whether I am arrested or killed in the interim has no bearing on the
preparations of the militia units, the ultimatum, or the Declaration of
Independence throughout this country.

    Proceed as planned, plan accordingly, and God bless us all.

Linda Thompson
Acting Adjutant General
UMUS, pursuant to
10 USC 311
Articles  I and II, Bill of Rights, Constitution of the United States of
America

Additional information and updates will be posted on the American
Justice Federation voice mail line at 317-780-5200 beginning April 20,
1994.  Leave a message if you can volunteer to help print these
documents, fly planes to airdrop literature, get the information on
radio or television, etc.
A copy of this ultimatum is being delivered this week to each member of the
U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, as well as to all national
media.

				ULTIMATUM

     WHEREAS, the federal government of the United States of America is
constrained by the law of the United States Constitution, the Supreme law of
this country, to limited jurisdiction, and limited power; and

     WHEREAS, the federal government of the United States of America,
through unlawful Executive Orders, and through legislation passed without
quorum and without proper ratification or otherwise unlawfully enacted under
mere color of law by members of the legislative branch, have usurped the
Constitutional authority of the sovereign states and sovereign citizens of
this country, and laws which are unlawful and unconstititional have been
enacted in voluminous number which have outrageously exceeded the boundaries
of law and decency; and

     WHEREAS, the people of this country have been exploited and subjugated
to an unlawful authority by an unlawful system of loans from a private
banking institution, known as the Federal Reserve, and been forced, even at
gunpoint, to submit to an unlawful federal income tax which is not and
never has been within the authority of the federal government to enact or
enforce, all to the benefit of private individuals and corporations at the
expense of the liberty, lives, and property of the citizens of this nation;
and

     WHEREAS, persons acting under color of law as federal agents, under the
direction of those claiming to be elected officials operating under color of
law, sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, have
infringed upon the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms, have conducted
unlawful warrantless house to house searches and seizures, have assaulted
and killed sovereign citizens of this country on the false pretense of "gun
control," "child abuse," "the war on drugs" and a plethora of unlawful
statutes enacted to unlawfully control the lives and liberty of the citizens
of this country;

     WHEREAS, elections are now controlled through the power of committees
and lobbies wielding the most money to obtain electoral votes or sway the
nomination of candidates and persuade the enactment of legislation that has
made it impossible for the common citizen to participate as a candidate in
an election or for the vote of the common citizen to be meaningful; and

     WHEREAS, through an unconstitutional and unlawfully enacted "income
tax," the federal government has created a "carrot and stick" that has
seduced and coerced the elected officials of the several states to submit to
the unlawful incursion of the federal government and its agents into the
sovereign territory of each state, as a trade off for the receipt of these
ill gotten proceeds;

    THEREFORE, YOU ARE COMMANDED to uphold your oath and duty to the
citizens of this country, to uphold the Constitution and the rights of the
citizens of this country, and in so doing, you are commanded to personally
initiate legislation and do all things necessary to:

    Repeal the 14th, 16th, and 17th amendments to the Constitution of the
United States and to publicly acknowledge that the federal government has no
jurisdiction to make or enforce criminal laws outside its territories,
limited to the area of Washington, D.C., and the property and territories
actually owned by the United States, which does not include any State within
the several states of the united states; and

    Repeal the Brady Bill and NAFTA;

    Repeal the Drug Interdiction Act and 10 USC 372, et. seq. and any laws
which allow the use of military equipment or military personnel against
United States citizens or which provide a backdoor method to fund "national
guard," under the guise that the guard is a "state asset" even though the
federal government provides the salary, funding and support and none of
these units is counted as a State Guard asset, or which trains federal
"law enforcement" in military tactics and provides military equipment
to federal law enforcement for any purpose; and publicly acknowledge that
the federal government, through any means, may not use military force or
equipment against any person on U.S. soil or upon the soil of any sovereign
state, except in the case of a declared war or in the event of an actual
invasion by troops of a foreign country within the boundaries of the United
States of America, and only then, against such foreign troops, not citizens
or residents of this country; and

    Immediately remove any and all foreign troops and equipment and to
immediately identify each and every federal military troop and federal law
enforcement or tax enforcement agent and all equipment now located within
the boundaries of any and every state, including all assets of military or
task force "special operations" units, CIA, NSA, or any other covert law
enforcement, quasi-law enforcement or military agency or activity; and

    Declare that the United States of America is not operating under the
authority of the United Nations or if it is, to immediately renounce and
revoke any and all agreements binding the United States to such authority;
and

    Declare the federal debt to the Federal Reserve null and void,
unconsitutional, and without effect and order that currency no longer be
printed by the Federal Reserve or any entity other than the Treasury of the
United States, backed by gold within the possession of the United States;
and

   Declare that the federal government does not now have and never has had
the legal authority to enact or enforce criminal laws outside the area of
Washington, D.C., or outside its territories or its own property, such as
military bases, and never upon the soil of any sovereign state, and that all
such laws are null and void and without effect;

    Convene a full Congressional inquiry, to be conducted publicly, by an
independent prosecutor selected from a person who has no association in any
way whatsoever with any agency of the federal government, into the events in
Waco, Texas, from February 28, 1993 through the present, at the property
known as Mt. Carmel, with the special prosecutor to have the full power to
convene a grand jury from the citizens of all the 50 states, obtain
indictments, and issue subpoenas duces tecum and subpoenas for testimony
before a grand jury, and to prosecute any and all persons, regardless of
their position in government, for any crimes for which a true bill of
indictment is returned.

NOTICE:	  You have until the second full week that the Congress reconvenes
in September, 1994, to personally initiate legislation to this effect and to
do all things necessary to effect this legislation and the restoration of a
Constitutional government within this country.

If you do not personally and publicly attend to these demands, you will be
identified as a Traitor, and you will be brought up on charges for Treason
before a Court of the Citizens of this Country.

Linda D. Thompson
Acting Adjutant General
Unorganized Militia of the United States of America
Pursuant to 10 USC 311 and
Articles I and II of the Bill of Rights

	  Declaration of Independence of 1994

		 A Declaration by the
	       Sovereign Citizens of the
	       Several States Within the
		United States of America

     When in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary
for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected
them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the
separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's
God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires
that they should declare the causes which impel them to the
Separation.

     We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all people are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
of Happiness.

     That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted
among the people, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the
Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on
such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

     Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and
accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed
to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed.

     But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under
absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such
Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.

     Such has been the patient Sufferance of the people of the
several states of the United States of America; and such is now the
Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of
Government.

     The history of the present federal government of the United
States of America is one of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all
having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over
these States and over the sovereign citizens within the several states.
To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.

     All Branches, the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial, of the
federal government, have refused Assent to Laws, the most wholesome
and necessary for the public Good, the most blatant example of which
is the total contempt in which they have held the Constitution of the
United States and the rights of the citizens of this country protected by
the limitations upon government set forth in the Constitution;

     The President and Congress have forbidden state Governors
to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance, under inducement
or threat of the loss of federal funding, unless suspended in their
Operation till their Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,
they have utterly neglected to attend to them;

     The legislative branch has refused to pass other Laws for the
Accommodation of large Districts of People, unless those People would
relinquish the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a Right
inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only, as evidenced
through the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States, and the present federal voting system, which is a
national sham and disgrace, and prevents the common man from
participating either as a candidate, or by meaningful vote for a
candidate of his choosing in a truly free and open election;

     The Congress convenes in a manner which is inaccessible to
the general public who are not allowed to address the Congress nor to
directly supervise the activities of Congress, and publishes its business
in records not readily accessible to the People, intentionally obtuse in
the construction of both the laws and the publication thereof, for the
Purposes of deceiving and fatiguing the people into Compliance with
such Measures.	The federal judicial offices and congress have set
themselves wholly apart from and above the people, immune even from
suit for their transgressions, answerable to none, and responsive to
none except those who further their private interests;

     The federal government, through unlawfully constituted federal
agencies which purport to be "law enforcement," and under the color of
laws enacted by the legislature which exceed the constitutional
jurisdiction of the federal government, has repeatedly murdered or
incarcerated those who have opposed with manly Firmness the
Invasions on the Rights of the People;

     The federal government has endeavored to prevent the
Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for
Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their
Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of new Appropriations of
Lands; and has endeavored to depopulate the United States, and for
that purpose, has waged chemical, biological, and radioactive warfare
upon the people, and encouraged and funded abortions and acts of
genocide upon large populations of the people;

     All the branches of the federal government have obstructed
the Administration of Justice, by subjugating the federal courts to the
department of Treasury and the Executive Branch, and by refusing
Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers and the independent
investigation of crimes committed by agencies and officials of the
federal government, insulating them from their crimes through executive
pardon, legislated and judicially created immunity from criminal and civil
prosecution;

     The Federal Judiciary have been selected on the will and whim
of the executive branch and a Congress inattentive to anything but their
own special interests and the will and money of lobbying groups, and
the judiciary is dependent upon them for the Tenure of their Offices,
and the Amount and payment of their Salaries;

     The federal government has erected a Multitude of new Offices,
and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out
their Substance;

     The federal government has kept among us, in Times of
Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures, or
through the seduction or coercion of the state legislatures through the
mechanism of "federal tax monies" offered in exchange for the
cooperation of the state legislatures in handing over the sovereignty of
each state;

     The Military has been rendered independent of, and superior
to the Civil Power, through the enactment of laws which wholly abridge
the Constitution of the United States and which seek to avoid the effect
of the Posse Comitatus Act through surreptitious and covert methods;

     The President, officers of the executive branch, and Congress
have combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our
Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving Assent to their
acts of pretended Legislation;

     For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops, foreign and
federal, among us;

     For protecting agents of the federal government and military,
from any trial or by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders
which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States;

     For regulating and strangulating our Trade with all Parts of the
World;

     For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent; for failing to
publicly acknowledge, more than 60 years ago, that the federal
government was in fact, bankrupt, but instead, concealing these facts
from the people and entering into a fraudulent agreement to finance the
bankruptcy, by creating and perpetuating a fraudulent monetary system,
to the enrichment of private bankers, insurance companies, and their
stockholders, called the "federal reserve system", whereby paper notes
are created to "loan" to the federal government at interest rates fixed
by these private bankers, and where only a portion of the interest and
none of the principal on these loans is paid each year; a system
whereby the payments are extorted from the people through a
fraudulent, coercive, unjust and unlawful federal tax scheme foisted
upon the people without their knowledge or consent and through a
labyrinth of licensing agencies and required licenses for all manner of
endeavors, which are themselves nothing more than taxes by another
name; all enforced by unbridled terrorist tactics and fear produced by
the brute force of an unrestrained government that seizes property and
imprisons those who do not "voluntarily" submit.

     For depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by
Jury;

     For proposing and enacting legislation to federally criminalize,
indeed to suffer the death penalty in many cases or at the least the
forfeiture of property, for the free exercise of the unalienable rights of
free speech and free press, freedom of worship, freedom of assembly,
or the right to keep and bear arms;

     For enacting legislation to seize the property of the people
under a myriad of pretenses, and to imprison persons on the testimony
of unknown, unidentified, and often paid, informants, who become
informants to secure for themselves a more favorable position in a
prosecution brought against them, and all within the states where the
federal government has no legal powers of law enforcement;

     For abolishing the free System of English Laws in the states,
and establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its
Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for
introducing the same absolute Rule into these states;

     For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable
Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments;

     For usurping the power of our own Legislatures, and declaring
themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all Cases
whatsoever;

     The federal government has abdicated Government here, by
declaring us out of its Protection and waging War against us;

     The federal government has plundered our Seas, ravaged our
Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the Lives of our People;

     The federal government, at this Time, is transporting large
Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of Death,
Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun, often under the color of the
law of the United Nations, and with circumstances of Cruelty and
Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally
unworthy of a civilized Nation;

     The government has constrained our fellow Citizens taken
Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to
become the Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall
themselves by their Hands;

     The federal government has excited domestic Insurrections
amongst us;

     In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for
Redress in the most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been
answered only by repeated Injury.  A President, whose Character is
thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the
Ruler of a free People.

     We, therefore, the sovereign citizens of the several states of
the united states, which now form the United States of America,
appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the Rectitude of our
Intentions, do, in our own names and right and by the authority of God
Almighty, solemnly Publish and Declare, that each of the sovereign
citizens undersigned are, and of Right ought to be, Free and
Independent Sovereign Citizens; that they are absolved from all
Allegiance to the federal government of the United States of America,
and that all political Connection between them and the federal
government of the United States of America, is and ought to be totally
dissolved; and that as Free and Independent Sovereign Citizens, each
has the full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which an
Independent Sovereign may of right do.	And for the support of this
declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence,
we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our Fortunes, and our
sacred Honor.

 Signers, this 18th day of April, in the year 1994 of
our Lord:
