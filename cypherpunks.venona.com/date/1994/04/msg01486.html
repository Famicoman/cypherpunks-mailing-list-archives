&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does it concern anybody besides me that the CIA [with a bunch of 
&gt;&gt; underemployed manpower] is jumping into bed with the FBI [whose
&gt;&gt; spokesman recently testified to Congress that they didn't have 
&gt;&gt; enough manpower to enforce the Crime Bill on us]?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes it bothers me, but not for the reasons that you think.
&gt;
&gt;First, be careful about characterizing the change as the CIA
&gt;jumping in bed with the FBI.  What is really happening is that
&gt;the FBI is taking over some of the counterintelligence functions
&gt;of the CIA.  [...]
&gt;
&gt;Believe me, the CIA is more upset about it than 
&gt;you are.  They are hardly "jumping into bed" with anyone.  Bent over a 
&gt;chair is more like it.

O.K., so it's rape.  They're still in bed together.  And I don't 
think I'm going to like the progeny.


&gt;The usurpation of CIA's CI functions bothers me because of the doctrinal 
&gt;distinction, not because it empowers the FBI.

Both aspects bother me.  Further empowerment of the FBI bothers me more.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does it make anybody nervous besides me that this is occurring 
&gt;&gt; at the same time that the 2ond and 4th amendments are being 
&gt;&gt; dispensed with?  While the Clipper chip and digital telephony
&gt;&gt; bill are being foisted on us?
&gt;
&gt;Yes it makes me nervous, but not for the reasons you think.
&gt;
&gt;See below.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is there a trend here?
&gt;
&gt;Yes.  I'm not sure if my version is close to yours, however.
&gt;

Opposite side of the same coin, I think.  You worry (correctly) that
a politicized intelligence/law enforcement establishment won't be
very good at intelligence/law enforcement.  I worry that it may
become good at something else.

&gt;
&gt;The trend is to use the intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies 
&gt;for domestic politics.  The NSA to promote the economic regulation of the 
&gt;crypto market.  The FBI to further the executive's domestic survell.
&gt;technology agenda, and put out the crime fire at home.  The CIA to
&gt;demonstrate, via a parade of horrors, how bad the problem is, and be the fall
&gt;guy for the FBI. [...]



&gt;This is a perversion.  I discussed this before on the list and in usenet.
&gt;Using the NSA as a public relations tool to the degree you see today is 
&gt;an idea that only the intelli-clueless Clinton would think of.  
&gt;Intelligence and law enforcement are not the President's personal program 
&gt;advocates.  

&gt;It detracts from real business and it destroys the 
&gt;credibility of the agencies in the eyes of the public.  

Yes

&gt;This makes it hard for real business to be addressed.

Yes


&gt;I have the greatest respect for the office of the Presidency, however.

If I keep an image of Washington or Jefferson firmly fixed in mind,
I can maintain just a shred of respect.
