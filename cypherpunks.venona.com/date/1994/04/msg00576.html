Now NBC News is interested...

&gt; 
&gt; Here's Keay's updated overnite story, which mentions your role.
&gt; AP has lots of different feeds. Not all the regional feeds run all the stuff
&gt; AP picks up.  This was released to all the wire services this afternoon.
&gt; 
&gt; NSA from A-1
&gt; Semiconfidential
&gt; rules circulate
&gt; 
&gt; By Keay Davidson
&gt; EXAMINER SCIENCE WRITER
&gt;    It arrived mysteriously at an Austin, Texas, post office box by ""snail
&gt; mail'' - computerese for the Postal Service.
&gt;    But once the National Security Agency's employee handbook was translated
&gt; into bits and bytes, it took only minutes to circulate across the country.
&gt;    Thus did a computer hacker in Texas display his disdain for government
&gt; secrecy last week - by feeding into public computer networks the
&gt; semiconfidential document, which describes an agency that, during the darkest
&gt; days of the Cold War, didn't officially ""exist.''
&gt;    Now, anyone with a computer, telephone, modem and basic computer skills
&gt; can read the 36-page manual, which is stamped ""FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY'' and
&gt; offers a glimpse of the shadowy world of U.S. intelligence - and the personal
&gt; price its inhabitants pay.
&gt;    New NSA employees are warned:
&gt;    ""Your home, car pool, and public places are not authorized areas to
&gt; conduct classified discussions - even if everyone involved in the discussion
&gt; possesses a proper clearance and "need-to-know.' The possibility that a
&gt; conversation could be overheard by unauthorized persons dictates the need to
&gt; guard against classified discussions in non-secure areas.''
&gt;    The manual includes a list of telephone numbers for NSA offices including
&gt; the cryptically named ""Agency Anonymity'' and ""Cipher Lock Repair,'' and
&gt; the not-so-cryptic ""Alcohol Rehabilitation Program'' and ""Disposal of
&gt; Classified Waste.''
&gt; "Anal retentive and paranoid'
&gt;       The manual is ""so anal retentive and paranoid. This gives you some
&gt; insight into how they think,'' said Chris Goggans, the Austin hacker who
&gt; unleashed it on the computer world. His on-line nom de plume is ""Erik
&gt; Bloodaxe'' because ""when I was about 11, I read a book on Vikings, and that
&gt; name really struck me.''
&gt;    NSA spokeswoman Judi Emmel said Tuesday that ""apparently this document is
&gt; an (NSA) employee handbook, and it is not classified.''    Rather, it is an
&gt; official NSA employee manual and falls into a twilight zone of secrecy. On
&gt; one hand, it's ""unclassified.'' On the other hand, it's ""FOR OFFICIAL USE
&gt; ONLY'' and can be obtained only by filing a formal request under the U.S.
&gt; Freedom of Information Act, Emmel said.
&gt;    ""While you may take this handbook home for further study, remember that
&gt; it does contain "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY' information which should be
&gt; protected,'' the manual warns. Unauthorized release of such information could
&gt; result in ""appropriate administrative action ... (and) corrective and/or
&gt; disciplinary measures.''
&gt;    Goggans, 25, runs an on-line electronic ""magazine'' for computer hackers
&gt; called Phrack, which caters to what he calls the ""computer underground.'' He
&gt; is also a computer engineer at an Austin firm, which he refuses to name.
&gt;    The manual recently arrived at Goggans' post office box in a white
&gt; envelope with no return address, save a postmark from a Silicon Valley
&gt; location, he says. Convinced it was authentic, he typed it into his computer,
&gt; then copied it into the latest issue of Phrack.
&gt; Private life not private
&gt;       Other hackers, like Grady Ward of Arcata, Humboldt County, and Jeff
&gt; Leroy Davis of Laramie, Wyo., redistributed the electronic files to computer
&gt; users' groups. These included one run by the Cambridge, Mass.-based
&gt; Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect free speech on
&gt; computer networks.
&gt;     Ward said he helped redistribute the NSA manual ""to embarrass the NSA''
&gt; and prove that even the U.S. government's most covert agency can't keep
&gt; documents secret.
&gt;    The action also was aimed at undermining a federal push for
&gt; data-encryption regulations that would let the government tap into computer
&gt; networks, Ward said.
&gt;     In the NSA, one's private life ceases to be private: A ""waiver must be
&gt; granted in advance of a marriage to or cohabitation with a foreign national
&gt; in order to retain one's access to NSA information ...'' the manual says.
&gt; ""The marriage or intended marriage of an immediate family member (parents,
&gt; siblings, children) to a foreign national must also be reported. ... All
&gt; personnel, either employed by or assigned to NSA, must advise the Office of
&gt; Security of any changes in their marital status (either marriage or divorce),
&gt; cohabitation arrangements, or legal name changes.''
&gt;    There's nothing wrong with ""casual social associations with foreign
&gt; nationals,'' but during such associations ""you are encouraged to extend the
&gt; usual social amenities. Do not act mysteriously or draw attention to yourself
&gt; (and possibly to NSA) by displaying an unusually wary attitude.''
&gt;    None of the hackers thought he or she had done anything unpatriotic.
&gt;    ""The cloak of secrecy that the intelligence communities operate behind is
&gt; an archaic paradigm of global warfare,'' said Davis, whose business card
&gt; identifies him as an ""Outlaw Transcendentalist.''
&gt;    ""The Cold War's over ...'' Davis said. ""What, is a terrorist group going
&gt; to call the National Security Agency alcoholism hot line and say, "Hey, I
&gt; have a drinking problem, can I come in?'''
