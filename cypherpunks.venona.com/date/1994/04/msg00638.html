Hi, people:

This is the new errata sheet.  There are somenew real errors, a whole lot
of niddly grammatical errors, and a few explanatory sentences.  I am trying
desperately to get Wiley to print a corrected version of the book.  To
help the process, send your thoughts on the matter to my editor:
	pfarrell@jwiley.com

the XOR function) are 110010.  The first and last bits combine to
form 10, which corresponds to row 2 of the sixth S-box.  The
middle four bits combine to form 1001, which corresponds to
column 9 of the same S-box.  The entry under row 2, column 9 of
S-box 6 is 0.  (Remember, we count rows and columns from 0, and
not from 1.)  The value 0000 is substituted for 110010.

the correct telephone number is "(408) 735-5893".

stream-cipher".

Page 356:  Source code:  "ShiftRegister = (ShiftRegister ^ (mask
&gt;&gt; 1))" should be "ShiftRegister = ((ShiftRegister ^ mask) &gt;&gt;
1)".

Page 360:  Equation should not be "l(2^1-1)^(n-1)", but "l(2^l-
1)^(n-1)".  (A letter, not a number.)

Page 362:  Figure 15.10:  "LFSR-B" should be "LFSR-A" and vice
versa.  The second "a(t+n-1)" should be "a(t+n-2)", and the
second "b(t+n-1)" should be "b(t+n-2)".

Page 363:  Fourth paragraph: "cellular automaton, such as an
CSPRNG" should be "cellular automaton as a CSPRNG".

Page 364:  "Generating Random Numbers."  Note that the obvious
way of shuffling, using random (n-1) instead of random (i) so
that every position is swapped with a random position, does not
give a random distribution.

Page 365:  "Blum-Micali Generator."  In the equation, "x_i"
should be an exponent of a, not a subscript.

Page 367:  Sixth paragraph:  "Ingmar" should be "Ingemar".

Page 370:  "Using "Random Noise."  Second paragraph, last line: 
"output 2 as the event" should be "output 0 as the event".

Page 371:  Sixth line:  "access/modify times of/dev/tty" should
be "access/modify times of /dev/tty".

Page 371:  "Biases and Correlations," third line:  "but there
many types" should be "but there are many types".

Page 376:  Seventh line: "send a message, M" should be "send a
message, P".

Page 380:  Step (4):  "K(R_B)" should be "K(R_A)".

Page 383 and 386:  "LaGrange" should be "Lagrange".

Page 391:  Second protocol, step (1):  "in his implementation of
DES" should be "in his implementation of DSS".  Next sentence: 
"such that r is either q quadratic" should be "such that r is
either a quadratic".

Page 401:  Second to last line:  "and x is randomly chosen"
should be "and x is secret".

Page 402:  Step (1):  "when all values of r are" should be "where
all r_i are".  Step (2):  "for all values of r" should be "for
all values of i".  Step (4):  "when j is the lowest value of i
for which b_i = 1" should be "when j is the lowest value for
which b_j = 1".  Line 18:  "2^t" should be "2^(-t)".

Page 406:  Step (5):  "i&lt;j" should be i&gt;j".

Page 409:  Third paragraph:  "measuring them destroys" should be
"measuring it destroys".  Fifth paragraph:  "it has no
probability" should be "it has zero probability".

Page 417:  Last paragraph:  "Kerberos is a service Kerberos on
the network" should be "Kerberos is a service on the network".

Page 421:  Figure 17.2:  In the top message "C" should be lower
case.

Page 428:  "Privacy Enhanced Mail":  First line:  "adapted by the
Internet" should be "adopted by the Internet".

Page 435:  "RIPEM":  "Mark Riorden" should be "Mark Riordan".

Page 436:  "Pretty Good Privacy," third paragraph:  Delete fourth
sentence:  "After verifying the signature...."

Page 436:  Pretty Good Privacy is not in the public domain.  It
is copyrighted by Philip Zimmermann and available for free under
the "Copyleft" General Public License from the Free Software

Page 437:  Fifth line:  Delete "assess your own trust level". 
"Clipper," second paragraph:  reference should be
"[473]".  Fourth paragraph:  references should be
"[473,654,876,271,57]".

Page 438:  Middle of page:  reference should be "[654]". 
"Capstone," first paragraph:  reference should be "[655]".

Page 445:  The IACR is not the "International Association of
Cryptographic Research," but the "International Association for
Cryptologic Research."  This is also wrong in the table of
contents.

Source Code:  The decrement operator, "--", was inadvertently
typesetted as an m-dash, "-".  This error is on pages 496, 510,
511, 523, 527, 528, 540, and 541.  There may be other places as
well.

Page 472:  Third line: "2, 18, 11" should be "22, 18, 11". 
Eighteenth line: "for( i = 0; i&lt;&lt;16; i++ )" should be "for( i =
0; i&lt;16; i++ )".

Page 473:  Function "cpkey(into)". "while (from endp)" should be
"while (from &lt; endp)".

Page 478:  Fourth line: "leftt &gt; 4" should be "leftt &gt;&gt; 4". 
Seventh line: "leftt &gt; 16" should be "leftt &gt;&gt; 16".  Twentieth
line: "leftt &gt; 31" should be "leftt &gt;&gt; 31".

Page 508:  Line 8:  "union U_INTseed" should be "union U_INT
seed".

Page 531:  "for( i = 0; i&lt;; i++ )" should be "for( i = 0; i&lt;2;
i++ )".

Page 558:  "#defineBOOLEAN int" should be "#define BOOLEAN int",
"#defineFALSE0" should be "#define FALSE 0", and
"#defineTRUE(1==1)" should be "#define TRUE (1==1)".

Page 564:  "#define BOOLEANint" should be "#define BOOLEAN int",
"#define FALSE0" should be "#define FALSE 0", and
"#defineTRUE(1==1)" should be "#define TRUE (1==1)".

Page 569:  "rand() &gt; 11" should be "rand() &gt;&gt; 11".

Page 569:  In "G13.H", "#define G13int" should be "#define G13
int".

Page 572:  Reference [45]:  "Haglen" should be "Hagelin".

Page 576:  References [136] and [137]:  "Branstead" should be
"Branstad."

Page 576:  Reference [148]:  The authors should be G. Brassard,
C. Crepeau, and J.-M. Robert.

Page 578:  Reference [184]  "Proof that DES Is Not a Group"
should be "DES Is Not a Group."  The correct page numbers are
512-520.

Page 589:  Reference [475]:  The publisher should be E.S. Mittler
und Sohn, and the publication date should be 1863.
