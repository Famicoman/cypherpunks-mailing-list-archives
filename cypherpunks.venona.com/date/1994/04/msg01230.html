Thanks for the algorithm... (I didn't find such a beast in my statistics
books, so, I'll use yours as I mentioned earlier...)

Actually when I came up with WNSTORM, I knew nothing about cyphers or
crypts, and had no idea about what PK systems were...  I was a clueless
crypto-virgin...  But somehow the idea snuck into my head that I could
emulate frequency hopping transmissions with a computer, and do it far
better than in the physical world.

Again, by now, you know how WNSTORM works, so for the others on this list
I'll recap....  Basically WNSTORM takes in a byte of plaintext, splits it
into its idividual bits and scatters these bits into a random number window
of variable size.  The random window can be anywhere from 2 bytes to the
limit set by the user.  (WNSTORM.C handles a limit of upto 31 bytes per
rnd window, although chaning a single #define would get around this.)

Two arrays are used for this purpose: DataBit[i] and DataByte[i].  DataBit
array contains bit values (ie: 1,2,4,8,16...128.)  These can be moved around.
ie: if DataBit[2]=128, this means that in the current window, what was 2^2 or
bit value 4 in the plaintext is now bit 7 (or bit value 128) in the cyphertext.

However, you also need to look at the DataByte[2] array to see which byte this
actual bit lives in.  If dataByte[2]==7 then our bit is in (stream[2] &amp; 128).

For each plaintext character a window/stream of random numbers is generated.
The size of this channel is determined by a maxchnl variable.  This value
is mod'ed with limitchnl which the user sets.  This is to prevent out of
bounds errors.  The DataBit[] array elements are either swapped, rotated,
interlaced, or otherwise shuffled.  The DataByte array elements are chosen
on each pass based on random values and the passkey.

All these actions are based on some formulas which take in the passphrase
and the previous random number window.  Obviously making a single change in
the cyphertext will cause the total loss of transmission for the rest of
the file...

Now, I did insert a somewhat "smart" statistical bit-fix routine that would
correct changes made by the insertion of the cyphertext bits into the
random number window.  Since any bit can be 1 or 0, there's a 50% chance
that a bit targeted for replacement by a cyphertext bit will change.  The
odds of a whole byte not changing are very slim of course (1/2)^8, however
the bitfix function will for all eight cyphertext bits will try to see if
the target bit was changed.  If it was it will try to find a byte with the
opposite value in another byte.  (ie: if we clear bit 128 in byte four, the
bitfix function may set bit 128 in byte two.)  If the bitfix fails to find
a corresponding free bit in the stream, it will set another free bit of whatever
value it can find.

The bitfix function targets its "victim" bits (ie: those bits in the random
number window which were not replaced by the cyphertext bits) randomly so
that there won't be much of a chance of detecting the changes made by the
bitfix function...

The bitfix function is only used durring encryption.  It makes no difference
for decryption since the algorithm uses the past window of data for the next
commands, so any changes made in the current window won't have any ill
effects.

Now, for the purposes of random numbers, the Borland C 3.1's random number
generator is kinda shitty, so I've put in an option to allow WNSTORM to read
random numbers from a device or file.  This would allow an external hardware
device (or device driver) to be hooked into WNSTORM.   This also allows
WNSTORM to be used for steganography.

In a Stego mode, two more programs are needed to interface with WNSTORM.  They
are extractors and injectors.  These are format dependant.  They may either
extract the low bytes of an image, sound, or other media, or if enough data
is available to hide the cyphertext, they may extract the low bit(s) of each
byte in the media...  The injector does the opposite of the extractor.  While
the extractor removes data from the media, the injector will take the cyphertext
output of WNSTORM and inject it back into the media in the same place where
the extraactor removed it.

As an aside, the bitfix function does not use the random device for picking its
victim bits.  The reason for this is that if it did, it would "eat" up data
from a possible stego lsb file which would cause major problems in injecting
the output back in.

Originally I didn't intend for WNSTORM to be used for stego, however, not using
it for stego has a big disadvantage (or two.)  Primarily, it produces
cyphertext that's about 0.5*limitchnl in size.  (ie: many times the size of
the plaintext you wish to send.)  However, using a large window size helps
the security of WNSTORM because fewer bits in the stego file are modified,
so there's less of a chance of detecting the presence of stego...

Another problem with not using it for stego is that you should have a
random number generator in hardware with a device driver to talk to it.  This
is because whatever compiler you use will have a poor random number generator,
whose idiosyncrasies could be sniffed out and compared to the cyphertext
produced by WNSTORM, so it might be possible to sniff out which bits of the
stream are used.

However, these weaknesses aside, I'd like some suggestions for a way of
attacking this algorithm to sniff out more weaknesses.  How would one go
about performing cryptanalysis on a cypher which uses random garbage to
hide and to encrypt?  Certainly chosen plaintext attacks will always fail
because encrypting the same text with the same password 100 times will
produce 100 different cyphertexts...

(Perhaps a good use for this is in cypherpunk anon-encrypted remailers???)

The one attack I devised in WNSTORM's eariler incarnation is now plugged up
(in the previous version I split the plaintext into two halves and hid the
nibbles in the random noise stream.  I also didn't use the random numbers
in the window which were not replaced by cyphertext.  The attack would have
been to do statistics on the nibbles, and also to move the whole cyphertext
into a RAM drive and interatively change one bit, decrypt the text, see if
there's any difference, if there is, the last bit we changed was used. This
could give you a map of the used/unused bits.  Neither of these attacks
will work.)

I realize that I'm still an amateur at cyphers and I'm still learning, so
my attacks on this program will be limited...  So, any of you have any
suggestions?  (I did notice a lack of interest in this... I posted up
announcements for WNSTORM a few weeks ago, and got only two messages from
interested cpunks...  So anyone interested in helping determine the
strength of this cypher?)
