&gt; "Rights are the items of a citizens characteristic which are outside
&gt; the ability of that government to control within its charter. Rights
&gt; come before a government forms. If they didn't then you would not be
&gt; able to give it a charter."
&gt; 
&gt; 	This is true in the sense that one has the right to exist and to 
&gt; function and in general to be oneself independent of artificial 
&gt; government  operations.
&gt; 
&gt; In Nature, you have a "right" to anything you like, but there may be no 
&gt; one besides yourself there to appreciate that fact and to deliver it.  
&gt; When a group of individuals associate and create agreements/charters, 
&gt; the delineation of rights serves to protect their separateness -  their 
&gt; property,   their privacy, their character - against encroachments from 
&gt; the group, by defining consciously where the boundary lines are to be 
&gt; drawn  -   what the individual can expect to keep, in exception to what 
&gt; everyone expects to share.
&gt;
Would you pray tell why these are not 'rights' under that government and
why they are not as 'natural' as any other right?

&gt; Once a group considers itself an official "society" of like-minded 
&gt; individuals, they often begin to demand "rights" which do not naturally 
&gt; belong to them or their society - or which they have not explicity 
&gt; agreed to share:
&gt; 
&gt; .  the right to have what others have created/produced
&gt; (like a service which nature does not automatically arrange for 
&gt; delivery  -  ex:  optical cables &amp; the internet at 3200 bps)
&gt; 
&gt; .  the right to access what is not their own
&gt; (outside of what nature has naturally endowed them with  -   ex: computers)
&gt; 
 Seems to me these are all results of recognizing that property is a possesion
since even optical cables and such are property, either intellectual or 
otherwise. If a government, when formed, is given a charter which limits
the ability of others to access these possessions then I hold their is an
implied 'natural' right.
&gt; not a society."
&gt; 
&gt; 	A society of like-minded individuals can also be a threat to the 
&gt; safety of non-conformists, depending on how the group decides to 
&gt; respond to those who are not exactly like the others.
&gt;     
Only if the charter allows it. I refer you to Santyana.
