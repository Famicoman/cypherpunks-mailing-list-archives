&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The very fact that this correction had to made offers some
&gt; &gt;insights into the National Security Agency.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I believe that releasing DES to the public was the biggest
&gt; &gt;cryptography mistake that NSA ever made.  Consider the state of
&gt; &gt;research in cryptology before DES.  It was simplistic.  It was
&gt; &gt;haphazard.  There was little interest.  If any results of value
&gt; &gt;were ever discovered, the NSA could squash them with a secrecy
&gt; &gt;order.  No one cared.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; There is one problem with this analysis: 
&gt; 
&gt;   IBM created DES. Not the NSA. Sure the NSA could have asked them to keep
&gt;   it hidden, but the NSA was also going to IBM and warning them
&gt;   about Russians evesdropping on IBMs networks. Everyone realized it
&gt;   was time for public cryptography. Especially IBM. It is not clear
&gt;   that a secrecy order would have worked. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is not to say that your analysis is wrong. They classified the
&gt; design procedures which was their attempt at a compromise. IBM couldn't
&gt; publish the details of how to make a good algorithm, but they could
&gt; release the details of the standard. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

Well, yes, IBM did create DES.  But the NSA against its better judgment
blessed the effort, and by my guessing helped tremendously.  I have heard
rumors that NSA *does* say it was their biggest mistake, and never again.

There is no way I can prove a rumor, but I put a lot of credence in these
particular rumors.  I speculate that it was Bobby Inman who ordered NSA
to facilitate IBM.
