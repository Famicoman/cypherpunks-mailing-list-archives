&gt;        Then, the editor from Newsweek said that in any show about the "Data 
&gt;Superhighway" the Clipper chip had to be discussed.  He then went on to 
&gt;say (and occasionally apologizing to Gore for being blunt) how the chip 
&gt;and the whole program were "loathed" by the industry and privacy 
&gt;advocates.  Larry asked Groves what he thought about it and he went off 
&gt;talking about the govt's legitimate right to tap analog media and how 
&gt;all this chip did was to extend that right into the digital realm.  I 
&gt;was shocked.  Even worse, Al Gore supported Andy's position and then 
&gt;when Larry King got back to the editor, he backed off saying "well, I 
&gt;just heard that people in the industry didn't like it." Larry asked for 
&gt;his opinion on it as a provider of information services and he said, 
&gt;"we just report on public opinions in our magazine and don't try to 
&gt;take positions on the issues.

That was Vic Sussman, from US News and World Report. I didn't see the
Larry King Piece, but I have talked with Sussman before. He is very
old school journalist, and was asked what he thinks 'as a provider of
information services.' He gave the partyline, 'as a provider of information
services.' When I am asked about something 'as a small magazine publisher,'
for instance (one of the few things that gets me questioned like that
:), I respond as one. No publisher is gonna let people talk about touchy
issues in an official capacity- it isn't professional and cause _tons_ of
problems for no good reason. Yes, that can be used as a lame excuse,
but there are many times it isn't. 

Grove, on the other hand, has no place making statements like that,
unless Intel has a political science wing I haven't heard of.

&gt;        Yuck.

I do agree with you on this.
