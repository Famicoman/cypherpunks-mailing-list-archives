If your zip code is listed above then you are one of Rep.  Torricelli's
constitutents.  "part" means your zip code is split between two
districts, one of them Rep. Torricelli's.  Rep. Torricelli is on the
House Intelligence Committee and needs to hear from you about HR 3627,
which would permit cryptography exports.  The attached file explains
all about the bill and why you should support it.

Call Rep. Torricelli today and ask him to send Rep. Maria Cantwell's
bill, HR 3627, to the House Floor!

INTRODUCTION &amp; ALERT

The Cantwell cryptography export bill has entered a critical stage in its
travels through Congress. The bill, which would loosen controls on the export
of encryption software, has been referred to the House Select Committee on
Intelligence, and must be be reported back from committee by June 16th or
it will die. This alert details the provisions of the bill, its history,
and what you can do to show your support. 

Voters Telecomm Watch keeps scorecards on legislators' positions on

WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

Estimated time to do this good deed: Two minutes

Show your support for HR 3627 by contacting a member of the House
Select Committee on Intelligence, especially if your one of your state's
representatives is on the committee. The end of this alert contains a
sample message on which you can base your contact. The following list,
sorted by state, shows the full membership of the committee and how to
reach them.

Remember, the deadline for the bill to pass out of committee is

What is the Cantwell bill?

The Cantwell bill would permit companies to export products with
encryption technology in them.  US companies are currently
not permitted to export products (hardware or software) with this
technology in them.


What is encryption technology?

Encryption technology, or cryptography, is the art of scrambling 
a conversation so that only the people communicating can decode
it.  Other people (such as eavesdroppers) cannot learn about
the conversation.


Where is cryptography being used?

Cryptography is used to encrypt electronic mail to protect its confidentiality
in transit.  It's used by bank automatic teller machines to protect
sensitive data (such as your account number, your Personal Identification
Number, and your bank balance).  It can be implemented into software
(such as electronic mail programs and word processors) as well as hardware
(such as telephones and "walkie-talkies") to ensure your privacy.


Why is there a restriction on exporting products with technology
in them?

For many years the United States was a leading researcher in
cryptography.  High quality cryptographic technology was available only
within the United States.  The US government thought that if they did
not let this technology be exported, foreign individuals would not be able
to obtain it and use it against us (by keeping US intelligence agencies
from eavesdropping on their communications)

Since then, cryptography research has been published in international
journals.  Companies have been created throughout the world who
export cryptographic technology from countries that do not have
these restrictions.  You can now buy the same, high-quality cryptographic
technology from many international firms.  Although the marketplace
has changed, the regulations have not.


Why should the regulations be changed?

US companies compete in a global marketplace.  Because of the export
regulations, they often compete alongside products with superior
cryptographic capabilities built into them.

The result is that US companies build their products with
an inferior encryption technology.  The result of this is that
you, as an American consumer, have great difficulty obtaining
products with strong encryption in them.

Because US products cannot compete against products with better 
privacy features, and because the laws are outdated, the regulations
should be changed.  The Cantwell bill fixes these regulations to more
accurately resemble the current situation of the world marketplace.


How can I help encourage more privacy-enhanced products and
pass the Cantwell bill?

Call or write your representative and ask them to support or cosponsor the
Cantwell bill, HR 3627.  You can base your letter on the sample
communication below.


SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL

The Honorable ____________
address
Washington DC, 20515

Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,

As a citizen concerned for my privacy, as well as a supporter of
American business, I urge you to cosponsor the Cantwell cryptographic
export bill, HR 3627.

The bill would allow US companies to produce and export products with
cryptographic privacy-enhancing technology in them.  These products
are already available from firms throughout the world.  US companies
lose nearly $100 million per year in exports to them.

By encouraging this industry, ordinary citizens like you and me would
be able to purchase products with better privacy features.

Please support or co-sponsor HR 3627.

Sincerely,

___________________________________
