Here's the last of these articles I plan to forward. This one mentions the
"persistent institutions" idea (based on timed-release crypto mediated by
mutually suspicious agents) I have mentioned at times. (I need to do a
major piece on this, as my comments are mainly scattered in various
places.)

Dave Deltorto was asking about hardware failure of the host machines as a
practical concern and this is what I was initially responding to.

&gt;Subject: Re: Timed-Release Crypto
&gt;
&gt;Dave Deltorto writes (about my idea for timed-release crypto):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, yes, Tim, but what about the MTBF rating fo disk drives and or other
&gt;&gt;storage media? Any such message would also be relying on the turst that the
&gt;&gt;disk it's stored on, the mail system and or the organization it was sent to
&gt;&gt;for storgae are still going to be around. Now, if there were dedicated places
&gt;
&gt;Loss of hardware over the years due to unreliability is unlikely to be the
&gt;main issue, for several reasons:
&gt;
&gt;1. Modern MTBFs for large disk drives are approaching 100,000 hours, or
&gt;well over 10 years. The drives are likelier to be voluntarily retired
&gt;first. And newer drives, including archival optical drives, are even more
&gt;reliable (the  drives may crash, but optical media survive). For the drives
&gt;that _do_ fail, backup strategies exist, as with all storage of critical
&gt;files. To wit, if your point is correct, then the failures of some disk
&gt;drives at banks, insurance companies, etc., should be producing some
&gt;fraction of "unrecoverable losses" each year. That they are not, because of
&gt;robust backup and redundant storage methods, is evidence that crypto time
&gt;vaults will also be reasonably secure. (Granted, you wouldn't want to trust
&gt;your $100,000 deposit for 20 years on Joe Random's aging Amiga 1000.)
&gt;
&gt;2. A relatively large file by today's standards, e.g., 10 megabytes, will
&gt;be a very small file by the standards of 10 years from now. The upshot is
&gt;that new and more reliable storage methods (and transmission methods) will
&gt;make storage of such small files quite trivial. (And remember that since
&gt;the pieces are encrypted, physical duplication for backups, redundant
&gt;storage, etc., is not a compromise of security.)
&gt;
&gt;3. The most reputatable crypto time vaults will of course be careful not to
&gt;lose client files, especially not for such mundane reasons as disk drive
&gt;failures.
&gt;
&gt;4. M-out-of-n voting strategies are likely in any case, to deal with
&gt;collusion of some of the nodes. That is, a file will be split into pieces
&gt;such that any 8 out of 12 pieces, for example, are sufficient to recover
&gt;the original file. (Encryption is a separate issue, though obviously
&gt;related.)
&gt;
&gt;5. The files are likely to be moved around a lot, anyway, making hardware
&gt;failures manageable on an instantaneous basis (that is, bad nodes, etc.,
&gt;can be compensated for when the time comes to reroute the files). Thus, a
&gt;critical file does not just get "parked" at one site for 30 years.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;where such t-r crypto msgs could be stored, such as a digital "bank" (where
&gt;&gt;they would no doubt charge a storage fee, possibly necessitating that each
&gt;&gt;such msg would be able to "peel off" digicredits from itself every year to
&gt;&gt;guarantee paying for it's own upkeep in case you were no longer aropund to
&gt;&gt;sign checks), the question of whether or not it would BE there in 30 years
&gt;&gt;might be moot, but that's a whole 'nother discussion.
&gt;
&gt;"Persistent institutions" is what I call these systems or trusts that last
&gt;for many decades. If such systems can be built, using some of the ideas
&gt;discussed here in this group, then interesting new financial and political
&gt;structures are possible. Imagine an anonymous, distributed trust that has
&gt;$10 billion in crypto-assets and a "goal" of funding nanotech or cryonics
&gt;research. (Lots of complicated stuff yet to be considered in enough detail
&gt;on how such "goals" might be stored, acted on, etc. For the sake of
&gt;simplicity, think of it as a kind of Howard Hughes Medical Foundation,
&gt;which once owned the Hughes Corporation, but which is not located in any
&gt;one single country....)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Still, I find your idea very compelling and full of merit.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks. Lots more work is needed.
