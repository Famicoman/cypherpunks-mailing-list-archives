&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rights are the items of a citizens characteristic which are outside
&gt; &gt; the ability of that government to control within its charter. Rights
&gt; &gt; come before a government forms. If they didn't then you would not be 
&gt; &gt; able to [draft a charter]
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that's one view of rights.  However, most attempts to base so 
&gt; called natural rights (i.e. rights that are somehow intrinsic to human 
&gt; existence) have been largely unsuccesful.  It's a tough argument to make.
&gt;
Seems to me the 'inalienable rights' that are mentioned in our founding 
charter carry this argument quite well. I suspect they also 'prove' them
as well. I am really not saying anything about 'natural' rights though.
The point I am making is that a government is defined by what it can and
can't do. This distinction is made at its creation through its charter.

&gt; Rights are entities that are granted to individuals by 
&gt; governments/agencies in a position to do so.  They exist only after a 
&gt; charter is drafted, because it is their existence in the charter that 
&gt; gives them their power.  The most obvious response when a right is 
&gt; asserted is to ask where it comes from, e.g. to ask "why do you have a 
&gt; right to privacy?"  An answer that makes sense is to say that it is 
&gt; implied in this country's constitution, and therefore is applicable in 
&gt; this country.  
&gt; 
&gt; To suggest that such a right exists independent of a legal context gets 
&gt; you into some pretty tricky territory.  You now have to make some claim 
&gt; about rights that are instrinsic to human existence, which implies that 
&gt; these rights must be common to all forms of social organization, a claim 
&gt; that is real tough to make about such "rights" as privacy and property.
&gt;
Since when isn't the Constitution a legal context?

&gt; A value can exist prior to a charter... I might say, "gee, I value 
&gt; privacy, and I think this value ought to be legitamized by my new 
&gt; charter," but until that charter has been accepted, the right doesn't exist.
