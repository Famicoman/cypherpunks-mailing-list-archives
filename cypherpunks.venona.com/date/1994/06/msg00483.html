The timed-release crypto message I just forwarded (in a kind of
timed-release fashion) generated some interesting comments from Karl
Barrus, Marc Ringuette, Robin Hanson, Eric Hughes, and even Larry
Detweiler--back when he was not so antipathetic (he's pathetic _and_
antipathetic, paradoxically) to our group.

For historical reasons, and because he makes some good points, here's his post:

&gt;
&gt;This is neat idea, T.C. May. Here are some things that popped into my
&gt;head thinking of it.
&gt;
&gt;I think the idea of multiple encryption of the time-delay message would
&gt;be extremely useful here. Imagine this. You encrypt a message with as
&gt;many layers as there are intermediate escrows.  In other words, a
&gt;message is encrypted with layer1 pw, then reencrypted with layer2 pw,
&gt;then layer3, etc.  In the decryption message (separate) there is a long
&gt;sequence of keys.  The lower-level keys closer to the actual message
&gt;are also encrypted by the higher-level keys.  Now, suppose that the way
&gt;the message is held is this: after 1 level of protection has elapsed,
&gt;the password message and the encryption message are recombined to a
&gt;single escrow agent. That agent uses the top-level information (one key
&gt;is plaintext (maybe not), or encrypted with that agent's public key, or
&gt;whatever) to decode the top-level of encryption.  Then, he again
&gt;redistributes the next-lower-level of encryption password message and
&gt;actual message to unique escrow agents.
&gt;
&gt;The beauty of this is that a given escrow agent, even once he gets a
&gt;password, can only strip off "his" topmost level of encryption (at
&gt;least, that's the intent). He is powerless to decrypt all the lower
&gt;levels and hence the message itself. Therefore to actually decrypt a
&gt;message ahead of time would require the collusion of many operators.
&gt;The message should have some kind of indications at each level when it
&gt;is to be "reconstituted" (just add water), and escrow agents of course
&gt;should hold or reject messages that are sent to them for premature
&gt;decryption.  There is also the distinction of "joiners" and "storers"
&gt;although the two could be combined in some way (both are "forwarders").
&gt;
&gt;The final destination should be the destination the original owner
&gt;intended, so that there is no final escrow agent that can decrypt the
&gt;message.  He only has an encoded message he can pass along, and another
&gt;agent only has a meaningless key and the final address as well.  When
&gt;the final destination is reached, the last layer of decryption can be
&gt;removed by the intended recipient (the money is in -X- account,
&gt;password -Y- or whatever).  I.e., the recipient is the final "joiner".
&gt;
&gt;The idea of separating keys and the encoded messages is really
&gt;ingenious, and I'd guess this "disassociation" has other uses as well.
&gt;An encrypted message with a password *existing* but *inaccessable* is
&gt;just as secure as a message using conventional encryption. In fact,
&gt;there is probably an added dimension of security---in most systems
&gt;*somebody* knows the key, but here, if it is generated automatically,
&gt;even the *key* is unknown for awhile!
&gt;
&gt;Another possibility is to have some kind of standard protocol for time
&gt;encrypted messages (this is interesting and seems feasible). Let's say
&gt;I want a message [x] to be unencrypted on date [y].  I call a "time
&gt;encryption server" and ask for the secret key associated with my
&gt;message and date [y].  I encrypt the message and publicize that
&gt;version.  The time server is constantly spewing out the daily code for
&gt;messages that expire on that date. Anybody just listens to the
&gt;broadcast and decrypts the messages in their possession using the key.
&gt;Note however that it is crucial that somehow the key depend on the
&gt;message itself (via the hashing approaches), otherwise everybody knows
&gt;everybody else's keys ahead of time just by submitting messages to the
&gt;server for the particular date.  I suppose public-key encryption could
&gt;be used here but I'm hazy on the details.
&gt;
&gt;P.S. this is a really tricky situation compared to above, but it might
&gt;be possible to make messages with "insecure" passwords that can be
&gt;broken in a few lifetimes from searches. Of course, this depends very
&gt;crucially on the pace of technology and the resources devoted to the
&gt;cracking, two highly variable factors.
&gt;
&gt;Also, keep in mind that every message in existence relying on
&gt;complexity of algorithms is encrypted based on the time-delayed release
&gt;of revolutionary and unforeseen computer techniques in cracking... or,
&gt;more specifically, the gamble that they will not occur...
