Not necessarily.  One could get in the habit of keeping all one's files
encrypted, decoding only the material that one has to occasionally release
in order to convince one's boss that one is doing productive work on one's
computer.  :-)

Many times when one is fired, one does not have the option of logging in
one last time.  The boss taps you on the shoulder, and escorts you to
human resources.  While you are having your exit interview, the sysadmin
is disabling your account.

For instance, the emacs editor has a mode (see crypt++.el) that
automagically prompts for a decryption key wheneve you open a file that
appears not to be pure text, in case you want to pass it through crypt
before editing it.  Only in the editor's buffer does it ever appear in
decoded form.  On the disk it is always encrypted.

If one got fired unduly, one's former bosses would have to ask for the key.

Of course, the usual reason peopnle get fired is incompetence, so there
may not be anything worthwhile laying around anyway.
