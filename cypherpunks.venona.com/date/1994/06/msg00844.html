This is kind of offtopic, but I wanted to correct something.


At least from what I know, if you place a 911 call from a cellular, it
doesn't pass any information on the phone number (or car) at all.  This
was originally posted on from the telcom groups.  I later tested it in
some respect.  E911 uses ANI to get your number, so I did a check on ANI
from a cellular.  The number ANI gets is a call-out-only line from the
cellular MTSO.

So how'd they find him? Your friend comes along with you on your run
from the cops.  You take his bronco (dumb move #1), you use HIS cellular
phone not a payphone (dumb move #2), you place long calls so the FCC can
track you in one of those nifty vans you only see in LA and NYC (dumb
move #3), and you call people who the government would expect you to
call (dumb move #4).  Well, with a simple addition they could have the
phone company add ANI to all his family/friends. Then they would know
its a cellular, and knowing that, they kinda guessed who owned it.  I
don't give them that much credit though, probably a tip from a
friend/family told the LAPD/FBI/CIA/NSA/FCC/BLAH that he was calling
from his friends Bronco. Then its a matter of waiting for another
cellular call. At that point, you'd know the tower (about a one mile
radius) and then you'd could easy send cops or a trianglulation van to
hunt him down with a 99% sucess rate.

Why anyone would attempt to run like this baffles me.  Unless he was
just stalling for time, he did things I think my little sister even
knows NOT to do in that situation.

Once again, sorry for the blurb, lets get back to cryptography.

Smiles,
jason
