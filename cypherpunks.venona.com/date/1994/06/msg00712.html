 &gt; If you find out anything would you please post it to the
 &gt; list?  This is very curious.

D.C. Williams remembered the thread and Emailed me a copy.
(Thanks D.C.) It was in alt.security.pgp which is why I couldn't
find it.  I was looking in sci.math for something with the word
"prime" in the title. :)

I quote the interesting sections below.

Nick Gilling begins by asking:

 &gt; Is there a formula for calculating primes?

Gareth McCaughan responds:

 &gt; Well... yes, actually, but not a useful one.

 &gt; For instance: "Wilson's theorem" says that if p is prime
 &gt; then (p-1)! is congruent to -1, modulo p. And you can check
 &gt; that if p isn't prime then (p-1)! is congruent to 0 modulo p
 &gt; (i.e., is a multiple of p).

 &gt; So, writing [x] for "integer part of x", ((p-1)! -
 &gt; [(p-1)!/p].p)/(p-1) is 1 if p is prime and 0 if p is
 &gt; composite. So summing this thing will give you a formula for
 &gt; the number of primes &lt;= any given number; and I'm sure
 &gt; there's a "formulaic" way to invert this to give you the
 &gt; n'th prime for any n.

 &gt; Alternatively, there is a polynomial of degree
 &gt; something-very-large in about 26 variables with the
 &gt; property that when you plug integers into it you get either
 &gt; a negative number or a prime; and every prime arises as some
 &gt; value of it. (In fact, for any computable property of
 &gt; positive integers, there is a polynomial in lots of
 &gt; variables such that the values it takes are {some load of
 &gt; negative numbers} together with {positive integers with the
 &gt; required property}. This is a Deep Theorem.)

 &gt; Alternatively, I suspect there is some sort of thing
 &gt; involving contour integrals and the Riemann zeta function.

James Kilfiger then expands:

 &gt; Actually it a little more interesting than this. First a
 &gt; disclaimer, I'm writing from memory and may be wrong on
 &gt; details If you want to see more a truly wonderful book is
 &gt; "The Little book of BIG primes" By Riemboiem (I've spelt
 &gt; this wrong) published by Springer-Verlag.

 &gt; This book as a section on prime number formulae, There is a
 &gt; famous class of polynomials {P(x)}, tend to be large (the
 &gt; classic one has 26 variables and has degree 25) With the
 &gt; exellent property of {all positive values taken by
 &gt; P(x)}={all positive primes}. The existance of such
 &gt; polynomials is gaurrenteed by results stemming from
 &gt; Hilbert's 10th. Also There is a number \theta with
 &gt; 3^\theta^n (or some similar formula, remeber I'm quoting
 &gt; from memory) being prime for all values of n, unfortuantly
 &gt; we can't calculate \theta, but its quite small. (if somebody
 &gt; can correct me on the formula I'd be grateful)

Gareth McCaughan then cites the following reference:

 &gt; By an amusing coincidence, when I went into our
 &gt; departmental library to look for a reference, there on the
 &gt; "new accessions" shelf was a book all about Hilbert's tenth
 &gt; problem. So, here's a reference.

 &gt; Matiyasevich, Yuri V. "Hilbert's 10th Problem" (MIT Press,
 &gt; 1993; in their "Foundations of Computing" series) section
 &gt; 3.4, at end.

 &gt; For those who are wondering how on earth it's done, here's
 &gt; a *very* brief sketch. In everything that follows
 &gt; polynomials have integer coefficients, and variables range
 &gt; over non-negative integers, which I shall call "natural
 &gt; numbers".

 &gt; Observation number 1: Suppose we have a set A of natural
 &gt; numbers, and a polynomial P such that: there exist
 &gt; x1,x2,..,xm with P(a,x1,..,xm)=0 iff a is in A. Then there
 &gt; is a polynomial Q such that the natural number values of
 &gt; Q(x0,..,xm) are just the elements of A. PROOF: put
 &gt; Q(x0,..,xm) = (x0+1)(1-P(x0,..,xm)^2)-1 and notice that if P
 &gt; isn't zero there, we get something negative, and if P is
 &gt; zero we get x0.

 &gt; Difficult Theorem number 1: There is a polynomial E such
 &gt; that there exist x1,x2,..,xm with E(a,b,c,x1,..,xm)=0 if and
 &gt; only if a^b=c.

 &gt; Observation number 2: So it's enough to find an
 &gt; "exponential polynomial" (i.e., we allow variables as
 &gt; exponents) such that there exist x1,..,xm with
 &gt; P(a,x1,..,xm)=0 if and only if a is prime.

 &gt; Difficult Theorem number 2: We can "do" the operations
 &gt; "factorial" and "greatest common divisor" with exponential
 &gt; polynomials.

 &gt; Easier Theorem: p is prime iff the greatest common divisor
 &gt; of p and (p-1)! is 1. (See a posting I made earlier in this
 &gt; thread.)

 &gt; Conclusion: We can "do" primality with an exponential
 &gt; polynomial, and hence with a normal polynomial.

 &gt; Annoying Fact: The numbers do get *very* large. I do not
 &gt; recommend trying to generate primes with this method. I
 &gt; haven't done the calculations, but I suspect that getting
 &gt; the prime 5 might require more computing resources than you
 &gt; have available.

 &gt; More details are in Matiyasevich's book. (Matiyasevich did
 &gt; a large fraction of the work required to prove all this and
 &gt; much more. He knows what he is talking about.)

Victor S. Miller, [who I suspect is the same Victor S. Miller I
knew at UMass Boston many years ago], published a nifty little
paper in the mid 1980's on the computation of the function Pi(n)
which gives the Nth prime as a function of N.  He had a table
giving the (10^N)th prime for n={3,6,9,12,15,18,...} which was
quite impressive.  Calculating the correct value for the
zillionth prime directly is a cute bit of mathematics.
