&gt;Subject: Times: Flaw Found In Wiretap
&gt;
&gt;NEW YORK (AP)
&gt;
&gt;A computer scientist has discovered a basic flaw in coding technology that the
&gt;Clinton administration has been promoting as a standard for electronic
&gt;communications, The New York Times reported Thursday.
&gt;
&gt;Matthew Blaze, a researcher at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, told the Times his
&gt;research had shown that someone with sufficient computer skills can beat the
&gt;government's technology by encoding messages so that no one, not even the
&gt;government, can crack them.
&gt;
&gt;The administration has been urging private industry to adopt the so-called
&gt;"Clipper chip" as a standard encoding system. The government says telephone and
&gt;computer messages sent with the chip cannot be read by an outsider but can be
&gt;decoded by government law-enforcement agencies.
&gt;
&gt;Officials fear that without such a system, wiretaps would be useless against
&gt;criminals and terrorists because their communications could be hidden in
&gt;unbreakable codes. But communications executives and privacy-rights experts
&gt;fear the potential for snooping and worry that foreign customers wouldn't buy
&gt;the equipment if Washington could snoop on it.
&gt;
&gt;Blaze said the flaw he discovered in the Clipper design would not permit a
&gt;third party to break a coded computer conversation. But it would enable two
&gt;people to have a secret conversation that law enforcement officials could not
&gt;unscramble.
&gt;
&gt;Blaze said a draft report of his findings has been circulating among computer
&gt;experts and federal agencies.
&gt;
&gt;The National Security Agency, which played a leading role in developing the
&gt;technology, does not dispute the flaw's existence, but believes the Clipper
&gt;remains useful anyway, the Times said.
&gt;
&gt;Michael A. Smith, the agency's director of planning, told the Times in a
&gt;written response to questions that the flaw found by Blaze was difficult enough
&gt;to exploit that most people wishing to circumvent the system would find other
&gt;ways to do it.
&gt;
&gt;Martin Hellman, a Stanford University expert on data encryption who has read
&gt;Blaze's paper, said: "The government is fighting an uphill battle. ... People
&gt;who want to work around Clipper will be able to do it."
