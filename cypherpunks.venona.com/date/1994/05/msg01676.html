Oh boy. Now I'm in for it... I *really* didn't mean to put the ball through
the window, mister, I was just trying to play....

Tim May said,

&gt;
&gt;David Chaum's work is of course central to Cypherpunks...

[Agree to all up to this point \|/]

&gt;IMP-interest folks had an especially naive view, for the most part
&gt;(based on posts I saw and things I heard from participants). I wished
&gt;them well, but it seemed unlikely that a group of such hobbyists could
&gt;build a real digicash system while avoiding Chaum's work!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; implicit in it was a sort of top-down-plan idea that was incongruous with
&gt;&gt; the do-it-first ethic of the internet. Cypherpunks write code, or Chaum
&gt;&gt; does, anyway ;-).
&gt;
&gt;Even with the smiley, are you implying Cypherpunks don't actually
&gt;write code?

[I think the ball goes through the window about here...]

I *really* didn't mean that at all. I did not *even* mean to "cast
asparagus" on your collective efforts. *Really*.

What I meant is that Chaum seemed to be making the implicit claim that he
had gone out and done something a whole lot of people around here seem to
have been hoping for for a long time: an Internet Mercantile Protocol.
*Not* a Kerberos-based Billing Server, *Not* anonymous credit cards, *Not*
a coffee-klatch at a BOF session somewhere, but a real way for people to do
cash transactions on the internet.

I think of Chaum as the 900 lb gorilla in all of this. Chaum is really
(because he owns the patents, after all) the only guy who could do
something here. I am _happy_ that he and his folks have kicked the snowball
down the hill. In my enthusiasm, I was applauding Chaum for doing something
whose time has come; I was *not* saying anything about the efforts of the
people on this list. If I gave that impression I *really* apologize.

Now the other stuff...

&gt;&gt; Could we talk about IMP here?
&gt;
&gt;Digital cash is discussed here often. And every one of the various
&gt;"digital money" schemes announced by folks has--I think--been forwared
&gt;here and discussed. In my view, Cypherpunks have talked a lot more
&gt;about Internet Mercantile Protocols than the IMP-interest list has
&gt;talked about crypto (an absolutely core technology, of course).

Having read the roasted-over imp-archives on thumper at belcore, I agree.
I was making the request in light of the fact that you folks have worked
over this ground before.  I was asking your indulgence more than anything
else...

&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1.) Chaum's e-cash coupled with WWW/Mosaic is a de facto internet
&gt;&gt; mercantile protocol.
&gt;
&gt;Hardly. Maybe it will be in the future, but enough infrastructure
&gt;pieces are lacking that it can hardly be called a "de facto internet
&gt;mercantile protocol."
[snip]
&gt;
&gt;(Cf. the soda archives for a "Glossary" and various articles on
&gt;Chaumian things.)

[will do]

This is the main point of my posting, I believe.  It seems to me that more
than that is being claimed by Chaum and Co.

[snip]
&gt;Of course crypto and true digital cash is central....this is our whole
&gt;message, nearly.

Violent agreement here...

&gt;You may be new to the list, but Magic Money/Tacky have been discussed
&gt;as recently as last week. And ftp sites have been listed. Also, within
&gt;the last week there were several discussions of making the schemes
&gt;more "usable by the masses." (Having said this, MM is _not_ an easily
&gt;usable, readily-convertible currency or even a payment xfer system for
&gt;real currency...again, see the many posts on this.)

I agree.  I just started learning about all this stuff in the last three
months or so. But, I've been lurking here since. I have been paying
attention. Honest.  I've been trying to do my homework. I've pulled
everything down out of Nexis/Lexis that I could find on Internet Commerce
and Digital Cash, Chaum, Eric, the Cypherpunks group (not you in
particular, I'm afraid ;-)). Hell, I've even read Schneier, though for the
life of me I couldn't discuss 10% of the technical stuff and keep a
straight face (for pretending like I knew what I was talking about, in
other words).

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just a second.  My flame-suit is around here somewhere... OK. Flame on.

Putting this thing on has drawn more fire than it kept off of me.  I better
keep it off.

&gt;
&gt;I don't think of my comments as flamish, but the comments here seem to
&gt;bespeak no awareness of the heavy focus Cypherpunks has had on digital
&gt;cash for a long time.

Here's where I wish eudora had a "say what I mean" feature... Again my
apologies...

&gt;That we have not "deployed" digital cash is
&gt;related to many factors, including patents, lack of financial
&gt;incentive (Chaum's folks have spent perhaps 10-20 man-years and
&gt;several million dollars, and Chaum holds key patents...it is hard to
&gt;imagine any of us competing head on...and make no mistake about it: a
&gt;"Pretty Good Digital Cash" scheme would, on the whole, be a much
&gt;larger project than PGP was), etc.

I suppose my point was that Chaum seems to be seeing what is happening out
there, (CommerceNet) and has decided he can make things happen by opening
up things a little bit. I applaud this. I was egging him on. I was *not*
trying to get my tail-feathers fried.

My analysis may be simplistic, but when Digicash Inc. says this:

&gt;
&gt;Payment from any personal computer to any other workstation, over
&gt;email or Internet, has been demonstrated for the first time, using
&gt;electronic cash technology.

I figure that somebody acted. Somebody wrote code. Is it shipping? I have a
product I'm dying to sell this way right now.

Maybe I should wait a day before I post when I get excited about
something... As it is, I feel like Garth and/or Wayne.  "I'm not worthy!,
I'm not worthy!" I really didn't want get into it with Tim May of all
people...

How many lawns do I have to mow to pay for the window, mister? ;-).
