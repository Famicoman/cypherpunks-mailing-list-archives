&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Introduction
&gt; 
&gt; Good morning.  My name is Raymond G. Kammer, Deputy Director of
&gt; the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and
&gt; Technology (NIST).  Thank you for inviting me here today to
&gt; testify on the Administration's key escrow encryption initiative. 
&gt; The Computer Security Act of 1987 assigns NIST responsibility for
&gt; the development of standards for protecting unclassified
&gt; government computer systems, except those commonly known as
&gt; "Warner Amendment systems" (as defined in Title 10 U.S.C. 2315).
&gt; 
&gt; In response to the topics in which the Committee expressed an
&gt; interest, I would like to focus my remarks on the following:
&gt; 
&gt;      1)   the principal encryption policy issue confronting us, 
&gt; 
&gt;      2)   the importance of encryption technology, 
&gt; 
&gt;      3)   how voluntary key escrow encryption technically works
&gt;           and how it ensures privacy and confidentiality,
&gt; 
&gt;      4)   alternatives to the voluntary key escrow initiative,
&gt; 
&gt;      5)   critical components of the Administration's policy on
&gt;           encryption technology, 
&gt; 
&gt;      6)   recent initiative to modify Secure Hash Standard, and
&gt; 
&gt;      7)   the effectiveness of the Computer Security Act of 1987.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The Principal Encryption Policy Issue
&gt; 
&gt; First, I would like to broadly outline an important public policy
&gt; and societal issue confronting us today regarding unclassified
&gt; government and commercial cryptography.  In developing
&gt; cryptographic standards, one can not avoid two often competing
&gt; interests.  On the one hand are the needs of users -- corporate,
&gt; government, and individual -- in protecting telecommunications
&gt; transmissions of sensitive information.  Cryptography can be used
&gt; for excellent information protection.  On the other hand are the
&gt; interests of the national security and law enforcement
&gt; communities in being able to monitor electronic communications. 
&gt; In particular, I am focusing upon their need for continued
&gt; ability to keep our society safe from crime and our nation
&gt; secure. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rapid advances in digital telecommunications have brought this
&gt; issue to a head.  Some experts have stated that, within ten
&gt; years, most digital telecommunications will be encrypted.  Unless
&gt; we address this issue expeditiously, law enforcement will lose an
&gt; important tool in fighting crime--the ability to wiretap--and the
&gt; mission of our Intelligence Community will be made more
&gt; difficult.  The Committee is undoubtedly aware of the benefits
&gt; such intelligence brings to the nation.  This matter raises broad
&gt; societal issues of significant importance.  I have personally
&gt; been involved in many meetings of a philosophical and wide-
&gt; ranging nature to discuss this dilemma. 
&gt; 
&gt;       Four broad conceptual alternatives emerged:   
&gt;      
&gt;          Seek a legislative mandate criminalizing the use of
&gt;           unauthorized cryptography. 
&gt; 
&gt;          Seek wide adoption of an encryption method with an
&gt;           unannounced "trap door."  This was never seriously
&gt;           considered.  
&gt; 
&gt;          Seek wide voluntary adoption of a technology
&gt;           incorporating a secure "key escrow" scheme.
&gt; 
&gt;          Allow technology to evolve without government
&gt;           intervention; in effect, do nothing.  
&gt; 
&gt; None of these options satisfies all interested parties fully.  I
&gt; doubt such a solution even exists, but the Administration has
&gt; chosen the voluntary key escrow technology approach as the most
&gt; desirable alternative for protecting voice communications without
&gt; impairing the ability of law enforcement agencies to continue to
&gt; conduct wiretaps.   For data communication the long-standing Data
&gt; Encryption Standard has recently been recertified for use.  
&gt; 
&gt; It is interesting to note that other countries have faced this
&gt; same issue and chosen different solutions.  France, for example,
&gt; outlaws the use of unregistered cryptographic devices within its
&gt; borders.  
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The Importance of Encryption Technology
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption provides one of the best ways to guarantee information
&gt; integrity and obtain cost-effective information confidentiality. 
&gt; Encryption transforms intelligible information into an
&gt; unintelligible form.  This is accomplished by using a
&gt; mathematical algorithm and a "key" (or keys) to manipulate the
&gt; data in a complex manner.  The resulting enciphered data can then
&gt; be transmitted without fear of disclosure, provided, of course,
&gt; that the implementation is secure and the mathematical-based
&gt; algorithm is sound.  The original information can then be
&gt; understood through a decryption process.  As I shall discuss,
&gt; knowledge of the particular key utilized for a particular
&gt; encryption of information (or, in the case of asymmetric
&gt; cryptography, knowledge of the associated key of the key pair)
&gt; allows decryption of the information.  For this reason, such keys
&gt; are highly protected.
&gt; 
&gt; Uses of Cryptography 
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption can be used in many applications for assuring
&gt; integrity and confidentiality, or both.  It can be used to
&gt; protect the integrity and/or confidentiality of phone calls,
&gt; computer files, electronic mail, electronic medical records, tax
&gt; records, corporate proprietary data, credit records, fax
&gt; transmissions and many other types of electronic information.  It
&gt; is expected that cryptographic technologies will be used on a
&gt; voluntary basis in the protection of information and services
&gt; provided via the National Information Infrastructure.  
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption used with these and other types of information
&gt; protects the individual privacy of our citizens including, for
&gt; example, their records and transactions with government agencies
&gt; and financial institutions.  Private sector organizations can
&gt; also benefit from encryption by securing their product
&gt; development and marketing plans, for example.  It also can
&gt; protect against industrial espionage by making computers more
&gt; secure against unauthorized break-ins and, if data is encrypted,
&gt; making it useless for those without the necessary key.  
&gt; 
&gt; The government has long used cryptography for the protection of
&gt; its information -- from that involving highly classified defense
&gt; and foreign relations activities to unclassified records, such as
&gt; those protected under the Privacy Act.  My point here is not to
&gt; list all potential applications and benefits but to give you a
&gt; feel for the innumerable applications and benefits which
&gt; encryption, when securely implemented, can provide.  
&gt; 
&gt; Hazards of Cryptography
&gt; 
&gt; Counterbalanced against its benefits, encryption also can present
&gt; many substantial drawbacks -- to both the government and other
&gt; users.  First and foremost, encryption can frustrate legally
&gt; authorized criminal investigations by the federal, state, and
&gt; local law enforcement agencies.  As their representatives can
&gt; better explain, lawful electronic surveillance has proven to be
&gt; of the utmost benefit in both investigating and prosecuting
&gt; serious criminal activity, including violent crime. 
&gt; Cryptographic technologies can also seriously harm our national
&gt; security and intelligence capabilities.  As I shall discuss, the
&gt; Administration recognizes that the consequences of wide-spread,
&gt; high quality encryption upon law enforcement and national
&gt; security are considerable.
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption may also prove a potential hazard to other users, such
&gt; as private sector firms, particularly as we move into the
&gt; Information Age.  Private firms, too, are concerned about the
&gt; misuses of cryptography by their employees.  For example, a rogue
&gt; employee may encrypt files and offer the "key" for ransom.  This
&gt; is often referred to as the "data hostage" issue.  Keys can also
&gt; be lost or forgotten, resulting in the unavailability of data. 
&gt; Additionally, users of encryption may gain a false sense of
&gt; security by using poorly designed or implemented encryption.  To
&gt; protect against such hazards, some corporations have expressed
&gt; interest in a "corporate" key escrowing capability to minimize
&gt; harm to their organizations from internal misuse of cryptography. 
&gt;  As security experts point out, such a false sense of security
&gt; can be worse than if no security measures were taken at all. 
&gt; Encryption is not a "cure-all" to all security problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me now turn to the details of the Administration's key escrow
&gt; encryption initiative.  
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Voluntary Key Escrow Encryption Initiative
&gt; 
&gt; Goals of the Voluntary Key Escrow Encryption Initiative 
&gt; 
&gt; I will begin my remarks about the government-developed key escrow
&gt; encryption chips (referred to as "chips" herein) by discussing
&gt; the goals that we were trying to achieve in developing this
&gt; technology for application to voice-grade communication. 
&gt; 
&gt; At the outset, we sought to develop a technology which provides
&gt; very strong protection for government information requiring
&gt; confidentiality protection.  Much of the sensitive information
&gt; which the government holds, processes, and transmits is personal
&gt; and requires strong protection.  Tax records and census data are
&gt; two such examples.  We sought nothing less than excellent
&gt; protection for government communications.  In order to allow
&gt; agencies to easily take advantage of this technology, its
&gt; voluntary use (in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
&gt; 185) to protect telephone communications has been approved by the
&gt; Secretary of Commerce. 
&gt; 
&gt; The chips implementing FIPS 185 efficiently support applications
&gt; within the its scope.  They far exceed the speed requirements of
&gt; commercial modems existing today or envisioned for the near
&gt; future.  
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to the need for strong information protection, the
&gt; increasingly digitized nature of advanced telecommunications is
&gt; expected to significantly hamper the ability of domestic law
&gt; enforcement to carry out lawfully authorized wiretapping.  Their
&gt; problem has two dimensions.  
&gt; 
&gt; First, the design and complexity of the nation's
&gt; telecommunications networks makes locating those communications
&gt; which can be lawfully tapped very difficult.  This is the digital
&gt; telephony issue, which my law enforcement colleague will discuss
&gt; today.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, the proliferation of encryption is expected to make law
&gt; enforcement's tasks more difficult.  If a telephone conversation
&gt; is encrypted, resources must be expended for decryption, where
&gt; feasible.  Such expenditures and technical capabilities are
&gt; normally far outside the ability of local law enforcement
&gt; organizations and could be quite significant at the federal
&gt; level.  In seeking to make available a strong encryption
&gt; technology, we have sought to take in to account the needs of the
&gt; law enforcement community.  For example, one of the reasons that
&gt; the SKIPJACK algorithm, the formula on which the key escrow chip
&gt; is based, is being kept classified is that its release would make
&gt; their job much harder were it to be used to hide criminal
&gt; activity.  
&gt; 
&gt; Misconceptions Concerning the Purpose of the Voluntary Key Escrow
&gt; Encryption Initiative
&gt; 
&gt; A number of those opposed to this Administration initiative have
&gt; expressed doubt about whether the key escrow encryption
&gt; initiative can do anything to solve this nation's crime problem. 
&gt; Of course, this initiative cannot by itself do so.  The basic
&gt; intent of the program is the provision of sound security, without
&gt; adversely affecting other government interests, including, when
&gt; necessary, the protection of society through lawfully authorized
&gt; electronic surveillance.
&gt; 
&gt; The voluntary key escrow encryption initiative, first and
&gt; foremost, was devised to provide solid, first-rate cryptographic
&gt; security for the protection of information held by the government
&gt; when government agencies decide such protection is needed for
&gt; unclassified government communications -- for example, tax,
&gt; social security and proprietary information.  (The Escrowed
&gt; Encryption Standard (FIPS 185) allows federal agencies to use
&gt; this technology for protection of telephone communications.) 
&gt; This was done, in part, with the realization that the current
&gt; government cryptographic technique, the Data Encryption Standard
&gt; (which was recently re-approved) is over fifteen years old; while
&gt; DES is still sound, its usefulness will not continue
&gt; indefinitely.  We also recognized that were we to disclose an
&gt; even stronger algorithm (with the government's "seal of
&gt; approval"), it could be misused to hamper lawful investigations,
&gt; particularly electronic surveillance.  
&gt; 
&gt; In approving this initiative, we felt it important that
&gt; protective measures be taken to prevent its misuse -- a safety
&gt; catch, if you will.  This will help assure that this powerful
&gt; technology is not misused if adopted and used voluntarily by
&gt; others.  Our method of providing this safety mechanism relies
&gt; upon escrowing cryptographic key components so that, if the
&gt; technology is misused, lawful investigations will not be
&gt; thwarted.  Additionally, the algorithm (SKIPJACK) will remain
&gt; classified so that its only uses will be consistent with our
&gt; safety mechanism, key escrowing.  I think it is fair to say that
&gt; use of this powerful algorithm without key escrowing could pose a
&gt; serious threat to our public safety and our national security.  
&gt; 
&gt; Key Escrow Encryption Technology
&gt; 
&gt; The National Security Agency, in consultation with NIST and the
&gt; federal law enforcement community, undertook to apply voluntary
&gt; key escrow encryption technology to voice-grade communications.
&gt; The product of this effort was announced in the April 16, 1993
&gt; White House release concerning the key escrow encryption chip.  I
&gt; note that we have chosen to discontinue use of the term "Clipper
&gt; Chip" to avoid potential confusion with products and services
&gt; with similar names. 
&gt; 
&gt; The state-of-the-art microcircuit, the key escrow encryption
&gt; chip, can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption
&gt; devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It
&gt; scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm
&gt; more powerful than many in commercial use today.  The SKIPJACK
&gt; algorithm, with an 80-bit long cryptographic key,is approximately
&gt; 16 million times stronger than DES.  For the record, I will
&gt; restate my earlier public statements that there is no trapdoor in
&gt; the algorithm.  
&gt; 
&gt; Each key escrow encryption chip has two basic functions. The
&gt; first is an encryption function, which is accomplished by the
&gt; SKIPJACK algorithm, developed and rigorously tested by NSA.  The
&gt; second function is a law enforcement access method.  I will
&gt; discuss each briefly. 
&gt; 
&gt; The SKIPJACK algorithm is a symmetric algorithm (as opposed to
&gt; "public-key" algorithms).  Basically, this means that the same
&gt; cryptographic key (the session key) is used for both encryption
&gt; and decryption.  The algorithm is so strong that the Department
&gt; of Defense will evaluate it for use in protecting selected
&gt; classified applications.  
&gt; 
&gt; The second basic function of the chip is the provision for law
&gt; enforcement access under lawful authorization.  To do so, each
&gt; chip is programmed with three values:  a cryptographic family
&gt; key, a device unique key, and a serial number.  (The device
&gt; unique key is split into two key components which are then
&gt; encrypted and are provided to the two current escrow agents, NIST
&gt; and the Automated Systems Division of the Department of the
&gt; Treasury, for secure storage.)  These three values are used in
&gt; conjunction with the session key (which itself encrypts the
&gt; message) in the creation of the law enforcement access field. 
&gt; When law enforcement has obtained lawful authorization for
&gt; electronic surveillance, the serial number can be obtained
&gt; electronically.  Law enforcement can then take the serial number
&gt; and a certification of their legal authorization to the two
&gt; escrow agents.  (Detailed procedures for the release of these key
&gt; components were issued by the Department of Justice in early
&gt; February.)  After these certifications are received, the
&gt; encrypted components will be transmitted by escrow agent
&gt; officials for combination in the decrypt-processor.   
&gt; 
&gt; After decryption of the key components within the decrypt
&gt; processor, the two key components are then mathematically
&gt; combined, yielding the device unique key.  This key is used to
&gt; obtain another key, the session key, which is used to decrypt and
&gt; understand the message.  This device unique key may be used by
&gt; law enforcement only for the decryption of communications
&gt; obtained during the applicable period of time of the lawful
&gt; electronic surveillance authorization.  It can also only be used
&gt; to decrypt communications transmitted or received by the device
&gt; in question.
&gt; 
&gt; Security and Privacy Using Key Escrow Encryption
&gt; 
&gt; When the Administration announced the voluntary key escrow
&gt; encryption initiative, we anticipated that questions would be
&gt; raised about the strength and integrity of the SKIPJACK
&gt; algorithm, which is at the heart of the system.  We assured the
&gt; public that we knew of no weakness in the algorithm and that
&gt; there was not an undisclosed point of entry, commonly referred to
&gt; as a trapdoor.  The algorithm was designed by cryptographic
&gt; experts at the National Security Agency and withstood a rigorous
&gt; testing and analysis process.    
&gt; 
&gt; As a further way to indicate the fundamental strength of
&gt; SKIPJACK, we invited a group of independent experts in
&gt; cryptography to review the algorithm, under appropriate security
&gt; conditions, and make their results publicly known, again,
&gt; consistent with the classified nature of the algorithm.  This
&gt; group consisted of Ernest Brickell (Sandia National
&gt; Laboratories), Dorothy Denning (Georgetown University), Stephen
&gt; Kent (BBN Communications Corp.), David Maher (AT&amp;T) and Walter
&gt; Tuchman (Amperif Corp.).  These experts reported that:  
&gt; 
&gt;          Under an assumption that the cost of processing power
&gt;           is halved every eighteen months, it will be 36 years
&gt;           before the cost of breaking SKIPJACK by exhaustive
&gt;           search will be equal to the cost of breaking DES today;
&gt;           
&gt; 
&gt;           and 
&gt; 
&gt;          There is no significant risk that SKIPJACK can be
&gt;           broken through a shortcut method of attack. 
&gt; 
&gt; Let me also repeat the reasons why the algorithm must remain
&gt; classified.  First, we believe it would be irresponsible to
&gt; publish the technical details.  This would be tantamount to
&gt; handing over this strong algorithm to those who may use it to
&gt; hide criminal activity.  Publishing the algorithm may also reveal
&gt; some of the classified design techniques that NSA uses to design
&gt; military-strength technology.  It would also allow devices to be
&gt; built without the key escrowing feature, again allowing criminals
&gt; to take advantage of the strength of this very powerful
&gt; technology without any safeguard for society.
&gt; 
&gt; With regard to privacy, key escrow encryption can, of course, be
&gt; used to protect personal information contained in telephone
&gt; communications.  Moreover, the voluntary key escrow encryption
&gt; initiative does not expand the government's authority for the
&gt; conduct of electronic surveillance, as my colleague from the
&gt; Federal Bureau of Investigation will discuss.  It is important to
&gt; understand that the escrow agents will not track the devices by
&gt; individual owners; they will simply maintain a database of chip
&gt; ID numbers and associated chip unique key components (which
&gt; themselves are encrypted).  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Alternatives to the Voluntary Key Escrow Initiative
&gt; 
&gt; In reaction to industry's concerns about our hardware-only
&gt; implementation of key escrow encryption, we announced an
&gt; opportunity for industry to work with us on developing secure
&gt; software-based key escrow encryption.  Unfortunately, initial
&gt; industry interest was minimal; our offer, however, remains open. 
&gt; We are also willing to work on hardware alternatives to key
&gt; escrowing as we emphasized in our recent announcements. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Administration has been seeking to meet with members of the
&gt; computer, software, and telecommunications industries to discuss
&gt; the importance of this matter.  We are open to other approaches.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Key Government Policies on Unclassified/Commercial Encryption
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption is an important tool to protect privacy and
&gt; confidentiality.
&gt; 
&gt; As I discussed earlier, encryption is powerful technology that
&gt; can protect the confidentiality of data and the privacy of
&gt; individuals.  The government will continue to rely on this
&gt; technology to protect its secrets as well as the personal and
&gt; proprietary data it maintains.  Use of encryption by federal
&gt; agencies is encouraged when it cost-effectively meets their
&gt; security requirements.  
&gt; 
&gt; No legislation restricting domestic use of cryptography.
&gt; 
&gt; Early in the policy review process, we stated that the
&gt; Administration would not be seeking legislation to restrict the
&gt; use, manufacture, or sale of encryption products in the U.S. 
&gt; This was a fear that was expressed in the public comments we
&gt; received, and one that continues, despite our repeated assertions
&gt; to the contrary.  Let me be clear - this Administration does not
&gt; seek legislation to prohibit or in any way restrict the domestic
&gt; use of cryptography.  
&gt; 
&gt; Export Controls on encryption are necessary but administrative
&gt; procedures can be streamlined.
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption use worldwide affects our national security.  While
&gt; this matter cannot be discussed in detail publicly without harm
&gt; to this nation's intelligence sources and methods, I can point to
&gt; the Vice President's public statement that encryption has "huge
&gt; strategic value."  The Vice President's description of the
&gt; critical importance of encryption is important to bear in mind as
&gt; we discuss these issues today.  
&gt; 
&gt; In recent months, the Administration has dramatically relaxed
&gt; export controls on computer and telecommunications equipment. 
&gt; However, we have retained export controls on encryption
&gt; technology, in both hardware and software.  These controls
&gt; strongly promote our national security.  These export controls
&gt; include mass market software implementing the Data Encryption
&gt; Standard.  The Administration determined, however, that there are
&gt; a number of reforms the government can implement to reduce the
&gt; burden of these controls on U.S. industry.  
&gt; 
&gt; These reforms are part of the Administration's goal to eliminate
&gt; unnecessary controls and ensure efficient implementation of those
&gt; controls that must remain.  For example, fewer licenses will be
&gt; required by exporters since manufacturers will be able to ship
&gt; their approved products from the U.S. directly to customers
&gt; within approved regions without obtaining individual licenses for
&gt; each end user.  Additionally, the State Department has set a
&gt; license review turnaround goal of two working days for most
&gt; applications.  Moreover, the State Department will no longer
&gt; require that U.S. citizens obtain an export license prior to
&gt; taking encryption products out of the U.S. temporarily for their
&gt; own personal use.  Lastly, after a one-time initial technical
&gt; review, key escrow encryption products may now be exported to
&gt; most end users.  These reforms should help to minimize the effect
&gt; of export controls on U.S. industry.
&gt; 
&gt; The Government requires a mechanism to deal with continuing
&gt; encryption policy issues.
&gt; 
&gt; In recognition of this, the Interagency Working Group on
&gt; Encryption and Telecommunications was formed in recognition of
&gt; the possibility that the economic significance of our current
&gt; encryption policy could change.  The Working Group has been
&gt; assigned to monitor changes in the balance that the President has
&gt; struck with these policy decisions and to recommend changes in
&gt; policy as circumstances warrant.  The Working Group will work
&gt; with industry on technologies like the key escrow encryption chip
&gt; and in the development and evaluation of possible alternatives to
&gt; the chip.
&gt; 
&gt; The group is co-chaired by the White House Office of Science and
&gt; Technology Policy and the National Security Council.  It includes
&gt; representatives from all departments and agencies which
&gt; participated in the policy review and others as appropriate, and
&gt; keeps the Information Policy Committee of the Information
&gt; Infrastructure Task Force apprised of its activities.  
&gt; 
&gt; Flexibility on Encryption Approaches. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the time of the initial White House announcement of this
&gt; technology, we have stated that this key escrow encryption
&gt; technology provides 1) exceptionally strong protection and 2) a
&gt; feature to protect society against those that would seek to
&gt; misuse it.  I have personally expressed our flexibility in
&gt; seeking solutions to these difficult issues.  We have offered to
&gt; work with industry in developing alternative software and
&gt; hardware approaches to key escrowing.  We actively seek
&gt; additional solutions to these difficult problems.  
&gt; 
&gt; We also stand willing to assist the Congressionally-directed
&gt; study of these issues by the National Research Council.
&gt; 
&gt; Use of EES is voluntary and limited to telephone systems.
&gt; 
&gt; The Escrowed Encryption Standard, which was approved on February
&gt; 3, 1994, is a voluntary standard for use both within and outside
&gt; of the federal government.  It is applicable for protecting
&gt; telephone communications, including voice, fax and modem.  No
&gt; decisions have been made about applying key escrow encryption
&gt; technology to computer-to-computer communications (e.g., e-mail)
&gt; for the federal government. 
&gt; 
&gt; Government standards should not harm law enforcement/national
&gt; security
&gt; 
&gt; This is fairly straightforward, but can be difficult to achieve. 
&gt; In setting standards, the interests of all the components of the
&gt; government should be taken into account.  In the case of
&gt; encryption, this means not only the user community, but also the
&gt; law enforcement and national security communities, particularly
&gt; since standards setting activities can have long-term impacts 
&gt; (which, unfortunately, can sometimes be hard to forecast).
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Secure Hash Standard
&gt; 
&gt; As the Committee may be aware, NIST has recently initiated the
&gt; process to issue a technical modification to Federal Information
&gt; Processing Standard 180, the Secure Hash Standard.  The Secure
&gt; Hash Standard uses a cryptographic-type algorithm to produce a
&gt; short hash value (also known as a "representation" or "message
&gt; digest") of a longer message or file.  This hash value is
&gt; calculated such that any change to the file or message being
&gt; hashed, will, to a very high degree of probability, change the
&gt; hash value.  This standard can be used alone to protect the
&gt; integrity of data files against inadvertent modification.  When
&gt; used in conjunction with a digital signature, it can be used to
&gt; detect any unauthorized modification to data.  
&gt; 
&gt; Our intent to modify the standard was announced by NIST after the
&gt; National Security Agency informed me that their mathematicians
&gt; had discovered a previously unknown weakness in the algorithm. 
&gt; This meant that the standard, while still very strong, was not as
&gt; robust as we had originally intended.  This correction will
&gt; return the standard to its intended level of strength.  
&gt; 
&gt; I think this announcement illustrates two useful issues with
&gt; regard to cryptographic-based standards.  First, developing sound
&gt; cryptographic technology is very difficult.  This is also seen
&gt; with commercial algorithms, including those used for hashing and
&gt; encryption.  Secondly, this incident demonstrates the commitment
&gt; of NIST, with NSA's technical assistance, to promulgating sound
&gt; security standards.  In this case, a weakness was found, and is
&gt; being quickly corrected.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 7.  Effectiveness of the Computer Security Act of 1987
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, as requested in your invitation to appear here today, let
&gt; me briefly address the effectiveness of the Computer Security Act
&gt; of 1987 (P.L. 100-235).  I will first briefly  comment on what we
&gt; learned about the state of computer security in the federal
&gt; government during our agency visit process and then turn to
&gt; cryptographic-specific issues.  
&gt; As part of our efforts to increase awareness of the need for
&gt; computer security, during 1991-1992, officials from OMB, NIST and
&gt; NSA visited 28 federal departments and agencies.  Each visit was
&gt; designed to increase senior managers' awareness of security
&gt; issues and to motivate them to improve security.  I believe that
&gt; what we learned during those visits remains valid -- and
&gt; indicates that we still need to focus on basic computer security
&gt; issues in the government.  
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically, OMB, NIST and NSA proposed the following steps to
&gt; improve security:
&gt; 
&gt;          Focus management attention on computer security.
&gt;          Improve planning for security.
&gt;          Update security awareness and training programs. 
&gt;          Improve contingency planning and incident response
&gt; capabilities.
&gt;          Improve communication of useful security techniques.
&gt;          Assess security vulnerabilities in emerging information
&gt;           technologies.
&gt; 
&gt; Actions are being taken by NIST and other agencies to address
&gt; each of these areas.  The background and discussion of the need
&gt; for these measures is discussed in the summary report prepared by
&gt; OMB on "Observations of Agency Computer Security Practices and
&gt; Implementation of OMB Bulletin No. 90-08" (February 1993).  In
&gt; short, the Computer Security Act provides an appropriate
&gt; framework for agencies to continue improving the security of
&gt; their automated systems -- but much work remains to be done, by
&gt; NIST and individual federal agencies.  
&gt; 
&gt; One of the questions that the Committee was interested in was
&gt; whether there is a need to modify this legislation in response to
&gt; the same advancements in technology that led to the key escrow
&gt; initiative and digital telephony proposal.  First, I would
&gt; observe that the Act, as a broad framework, is not tied to a
&gt; specific technology.  I think it would be unworkable if the Act
&gt; were to address specific computer technologies, since this is a
&gt; rapidly evolving field.  Also, I would note that the Act does not
&gt; address digital telephony concerns -- the Administration is
&gt; proposing separate legislation in that area.  In short, no
&gt; modifications to the Act are necessary because of technology
&gt; advances.  
&gt; 
&gt; Before leaving the subject of the Computer Security Act, however,
&gt; let me briefly comment on the Escrowed Encryption Standard.  I
&gt; strongly believe that NIST and NSA have complied with the spirit
&gt; and intent of the Act.  At the same time, this issue underscores
&gt; the complex issues which arise in the course of developing
&gt; computer security standards, particularly cryptographic-based
&gt; standards for unclassified systems.  
&gt; 
&gt; The Act, as you are aware, authorizes NIST to draw upon computer
&gt; security guidelines developed by NSA to the extent that NIST
&gt; determines they are consistent with the requirements for
&gt; protecting sensitive information in federal computer systems.  In
&gt; the area of cryptography, we believe that federal agencies have
&gt; valid requirements for access to strong encryption (and other
&gt; cryptographic-related standards) for the protection of their
&gt; information.  We were also aware of other requirements of the law
&gt; enforcement and national security community.  Since NSA is
&gt; considered to have the world's foremost cryptographic
&gt; capabilities, it only makes sense (from both a technological and
&gt; economic point of view) to draw upon their guidelines and skills
&gt; as useful inputs to the development of standards.  The use of
&gt; NSA-designed and -tested algorithms is fully consistent with the
&gt; Act.  We also work jointly with NSA in many other areas,
&gt; including the development of criteria for the security evaluation
&gt; of computer systems.  They have had more experience than anyone
&gt; else in such evaluations.  As in the case of cryptography, this
&gt; is an area in which NIST can benefit from NSA's expertise.  
&gt; 
&gt; Summary 
&gt; 
&gt; Key escrow encryption can help protect proprietary information,
&gt; protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent
&gt; unauthorized release of data transmitted telephonically.  Key
&gt; escrow encryption is available as a valuable tool for protecting
&gt; federal agencies' critical information communicated by telephone. 
&gt; At the same time, this technology preserves the ability of
&gt; federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept
&gt; lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption technology will play an increasingly important
&gt; security role in future computer applications. Its use for
&gt; security must be balanced with the need to protect all Americans 
&gt; from those who break the law. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would be pleased to answer your
&gt; questions.   
&gt;
