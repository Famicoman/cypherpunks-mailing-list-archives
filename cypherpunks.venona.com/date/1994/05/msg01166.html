By publishing a private e-mail, both beker and Johnson are in violation of
my copyright in that message, since it was a private communication and no
permission was given to republish.

Thus beker has now committed a new violation of his netcom agreement, and
Johnson shows he has bad judgement. What's more, by trying to make what
should be a private matter, to be decided by netcom based on their own
rules, into a public cause celebre, and by writing to netcom as Johnson did
to intervene in a private matter, he has made the situation worse for beker,
not better.

Netcom is perfectly capable of telling me to go peddle my papers if I'm
wrong.
David Sternlight writes:
&gt; [...]
&gt; Complaining against another user to netcom is with netcom's rules.
&gt; 

&gt; I am, of course, content to rely on netcom's decision in these two matters.
&gt; The behavior of officious intermeddlers like Johnson speaks for itself.

Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!!!  I wish this man would overdose  
on whatever medication he must be taking.   Or...perhaps he already has!


P.S. Sternlight breaks down into a rather amusing number of combinations if you  
take it as "stern" and "light."  For example:

stern  -&gt;  rump
light  -&gt;  intense

DOLLAR HAS SPIRITUAL VALUE!
JERUSALEM - Israel's chief rabbi, Mordechai Eliahu, says people should keep  
U.S. dollars in their pockets when in a restroom or an unclean place. His  
office said Wednesday that an American Jew raised the question because the  
bills say: "In God We Trust." The rabbi's religious ruling said that because of  
the motto, dollars must be treated the same way as holy documents and not be  
exposed to filth.
