Fed is not a bank but a conglomerate of privately owned banks. The system 
is a quasi-govt entity .

&gt; &gt; On this subject (really from the original post about money), I have several
&gt; &gt; times tried to convince people that the Federal Reserve Bank is a private
&gt; &gt; deal.  I don't know where I got this impression, but no one will believe
&gt; &gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thats because it isn't true.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are there some conspicuous facts that I could quote in support of this
&gt; &gt; position?
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Or, perhaps, an easily obtained and authoritative document which
&gt; &gt; explains just what the heck the Fed really is?
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed is pretty easy to understand. Although its set up to be
&gt; quasi-independant, it more or less the government body that regulates
&gt; the banking industry and controls the money supply. It does this
&gt; by setting the discount rate (fairly small importance), by open-market
&gt; purchases of treasury securities, by making deposits in member banks,
&gt; and by altering the reserve requirements of U.S. banks. The Fed also
&gt; is supposed to act as "lender of last resort" in order to stop banking
&gt; panics by loaning money in extreme situtations to member banks.
&gt; 
&gt; Technically, its not part of the government the way Amtrak, the
&gt; Resolution Trust Company, and other quasi-independant bodies aren't
&gt; part of the government. However, this is largely just an illusion. Its
&gt; as much a part of the government as the post office.
&gt; 
&gt; Its just a central bank, like every other central bank in most
&gt; respects.
&gt; 
&gt; Central banks are very bad things in my opinion, however, they aren't
&gt; some evil conspiracy of the Illuminati, conspiring in the back room to
&gt; take over the world. The Fed earns no "profits". It has no
&gt; "shareholders".  Its not a "bank" in the conventional sense.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know the head is apppointed by the US gov, but my impression was that the
&gt; &gt; rest of it was just a consortium of bankers to whom the national debt is
&gt; &gt; owed.
&gt; 
&gt; The national debt isn't owed to "bankers". Its owed to the holders of
&gt; U.S. government bonds. This includes everyone who's ever bought a
&gt; savings bond, lots of individuals, pension plans, money market funds,
&gt; insurance companies, corporations, banks, and lots of others.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides, if the debt was owed to "bankers", that would just be
&gt; shorthand for saying that the beneficial owner of the debt securities
&gt; would be the depositors of the bank, meaning the public at large.
