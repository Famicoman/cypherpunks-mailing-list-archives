&gt; of
&gt; 
&gt; Jerry J. Berman, Executive Director
&gt; Electronic Frontier Foundation
&gt; 
&gt; before the 
&gt; 
&gt; Committee on Science, Space and Technology
&gt; 
&gt; Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and 
&gt; Aviation
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. House of Representatives
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hearing on 
&gt; 
&gt; Communications and Computer Surveillance, Privacy 
&gt; and Security
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; May 3, 1994
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee
&gt; 
&gt; 	I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today on 
&gt; communications 
&gt; and computer surveillance, privacy, and security policy.  The Electronic 
&gt; Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a public interest membership organization 
&gt; dedicated to achieving the democratic potential of new communications 
&gt; and computer technology and works to protect civil liberties in new 
&gt; digital environments.  EFF also coordinates the Digital Privacy and 
&gt; Security Working Group (DPSWG), a coalition of more than 50 computer, 
&gt; communications, and public interest organizations and associations 
&gt; working on communications privacy issues.  The Working Group has 
&gt; strongly opposed the Administration's clipper chip and digital telephony 
&gt; proposals. 
&gt; 	EFF is especially pleased that this subcommittee has taken an 
&gt; interest in these issues.  It is our belief that Administration policy 
&gt; developed in this area threatens individual privacy rights, will thwart 
&gt; the development of the information infrastructure, and does not even 
&gt; meet the stated needs of law enforcement and national security agencies.  
&gt; A fresh and comprehensive look at these issues is needed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I.	Background on digital privacy and security policy
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	From the beginning of the 1992 Presidential campaign, President 
&gt; Clinton and Vice President Gore committed themselves to support the 
&gt; development of the National Information Infrastructure.  They recognize 
&gt; that the "development of the NII can unleash an information revolution 
&gt; that will change forever the way people live, work, and interact with 
&gt; each other."  They also know that the information infrastructure can 
&gt; only realize its potential if users feel confident about security 
&gt; measures available. 
&gt; 	If allowed to reach its potential, this information infrastructure 
&gt; will carry vital personal information, such as health care records, 
&gt; private communications among friends and families, and personal 
&gt; financial transactions.  The business community will transmit valuable 
&gt; information such as plans for new products, proprietary financial data, 
&gt; and other strategic communications.  If communications in the new 
&gt; infrastructure are vulnerable, all of our lives and businesses would be 
&gt; subject to both damaging and costly invasion.
&gt; 	In launching its Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) the 
&gt; Clinton Administration recognized this when it declared that:
&gt; 
&gt;    The trustworthiness and security of communications channels and    
&gt;    networks are essential to the success of the NII....  Electronic  
&gt;    information systems can create new vulnerabilities.  For example, 
&gt;    electronic files can be broken into and copied from remote locations, 
&gt;    and cellular phone conversations can be monitored easily.  Yet these 
&gt;    same systems, if properly designed, can offer greater security than 
&gt;    less advanced communications channels.  [_Agenda_for_Action_, 9]
&gt; 
&gt; Cryptography -- technology which allows encoding and decoding of 
&gt; messages -- is an absolutely essential part of the solution to 
&gt; information security and privacy needs in the Information Age.  Without 
&gt; strong cryptography, no one will have the confidence to use networks to 
&gt; conduct business, to engage in commercial transactions electronically, 
&gt; or to transmit sensitive personal information.  As the Administration 
&gt; foresees, we need
&gt; 
&gt;    network standards and transmission codes that facilitate 
&gt;    interconnection and interoperation between networks, and ensure the 
&gt;    privacy of persons and the security of information carried.... 
&gt;    [_Agenda_for_Action_, 6]
&gt; 
&gt; While articulating these security and privacy needs, the Administration 
&gt; has also emphasized that  the availability of strong encryption poses 
&gt; challenges to law enforcement and national security efforts.  Though the 
&gt; vast majority of those who benefit from encryption will be law abiding 
&gt; citizens, some criminals will find ways to hide behind new technologies. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; II.	Current cryptography policy fails to meet the needs of 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;        the growing information infrastructure 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	As a solution to the conflict between the need for user privacy 
&gt; and the desire to ensure law enforcement access, the Administration has 
&gt; proposed that individuals and organizations who use encryption deposit a 
&gt; copy of their private key -- the means to decode any communications they 
&gt; send -- with the federal government. 
&gt; 	 In our view, this is not a balanced solution but one that 
&gt; undermines the need for security and privacy without resolving important 
&gt; law enforcement concerns.  It is up to the Congress to send the 
&gt; Administration back to the drawing board.
&gt; 
&gt; A.	Current Export Controls and New Clipper Proposal Stifle Innovation
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	Two factors are currently keeping strong encryption out of the 
&gt; reach of United States citizens and corporations.  First, general 
&gt; uncertainty about what forms of cryptography will and will not be legal 
&gt; to produce in the future.  Second, export controls make it economically 
&gt; impossible for US manufacturers that build products for the global 
&gt; marketplace to incorporate strong encryption for either the domestic or 
&gt; foreign markets.  Despite this negative impact on the US market, export 
&gt; controls are decreasingly successful at limiting the foreign 
&gt; availability of strong encryption.  A recent survey shows that of the 
&gt; more than 260 foreign encryption products now available globally, over 
&gt; 80 offer encryption which is stronger than what US companies are allowed 
&gt; to export.  Export controls do constrain the US market, but the 
&gt; international market appears to be meeting its security needs without 
&gt; help from US industry.  The introduction of Clipper fails to address the 
&gt; general uncertainty in the cryptography market.  Announcement of a key 
&gt; escrow policy alone is not sufficient to get the stalled US cryptography 
&gt; market back on track.
&gt; 
&gt; B.	The secrecy of the Clipper/Skipjack algorithm reduces public trust            
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       and casts doubt on the voluntariness of the whole system
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	Many parties have already questioned the need for a secret 
&gt; algorithm, especially given the existence of robust, public-domain 
&gt; encryption techniques.  The most common explanation given for use of a 
&gt; secret algorithm is the need to prevent users from bypassing the key 
&gt; escrow system proposed along with the Clipper Chip.  Clipper has always 
&gt; been presented by the Administration as a voluntary option.  But if the 
&gt; system is truly voluntary, why go to such lengths to ensure compliance 
&gt; with the escrow procedure?  
&gt; 
&gt; C.	Current plans for escrow system offer inadequate technical 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       security and insufficient legal protections for users
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	The implementation of a nationwide key escrow system is clearly a 
&gt; complex task.  But preliminary plans available already indicate several 
&gt; areas of serious concern:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	_No_legal_rights_for_escrow_users_:  As currently written, the 
&gt; escrow procedures insulate the government escrow agents from any legal 
&gt; liability for unauthorized or negligent release of an individual's key.  
&gt; This is contrary to the very notion of an escrow system, which 
&gt; ordinarily would provide a legal remedy for the depositor whose 
&gt; deposit is released without authorization.  If anything, escrow agents 
&gt; should be subject to strict liability for unauthorized disclosure of 
&gt; keys.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	_No_stability_in_escrow_rules_:  The Administration has 
&gt; specifically declared that it will not seek to have the escrow 
&gt; procedures incorporated into legislation or official regulations.  
&gt; Without formalization of rules, users have no guaranty that subsequent 
&gt; administrations will follow the same rules or offer the users the same 
&gt; degree of protection.  This will greatly reduce the trust in the system.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	_Fixed_Key_:  A cardinal rule of computer security is that 
&gt; encryption keys must be changed often.  Since the Clipper keys are 
&gt; locked permanently into the chips, the keys can never be changed.  This 
&gt; is a major technical weakness of the current proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.	_Less_intrusive,_more_secure_escrow_alternatives_are_available_: 
&gt; The Clipper proposal represents only one of many possible kinds of key 
&gt; escrow systems.  More security could be provided by having more 
&gt; than two escrow agents.  And, in order to increase public trust, some 
&gt; or all of these agents could be non-governmental agencies, with the 
&gt; traditional fiduciary duties of an escrow agent.  
&gt; 
&gt; D.	Escrow Systems Threaten Fundamental Constitutional Values
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	The Administration, Congress, and the public ought to have the 
&gt; opportunity to consider the implications of limitations on cryptography 
&gt; from a constitutional perspective.  A delicate balance between 
&gt; constitutional privacy rights and the needs of law enforcement has been 
&gt; crafted over the history of this country.  We must act carefully as we 
&gt; face the constitutional challenges posed by new communication 
&gt; technologies.
&gt; 	Unraveling the current encryption policy tangle must begin with 
&gt; one threshold question: will there come a day when the federal 
&gt; government controls the domestic use of encryption through mandated key 
&gt; escrow schemes or outright prohibitions against the use of particular 
&gt; encryption technologies?  Is Clipper the first step in this direction?  
&gt; A mandatory encryption regime raises profound constitutional questions.
&gt; 	In the era where people work for "virtual corporations" and 
&gt; conduct personal and political lives in "cyberspace," the distinction 
&gt; between _communication_ of information and _storage_ of information is 
&gt; increasingly vague.  The organization in which one works may constitute 
&gt; a single virtual space, but be physically dispersed.  So, the papers and 
&gt; files of the organization or individual may be moved within the 
&gt; organization by means of telecommunications technology.  Instantaneous 
&gt; access to encryption keys, without prior notice to the communicating 
&gt; parties, may well constitute a secret search, if the target is a 
&gt; virtual corporation or an individual whose "papers" are physically 
&gt; dispersed.
&gt; 	Wiretapping and other electronic surveillance has always been 
&gt; recognized as an exception to the fundamental Fourth Amendment 
&gt; prohibition against secret searches.  Even with a valid search warrant, 
&gt; law enforcement agents must "knock and announce" their intent to search 
&gt; a premises before proceeding.  Failure to do so violates the Fourth 
&gt; Amendment.  Until now, the law of search and seizure has made a sharp 
&gt; distinction between, on the one hand, _seizures_of_papers_ and other 
&gt; items in a person's physical possession, and on the other hand, 
&gt; _wiretapping_of_communications_.  Seizure of papers or personal effects 
&gt; must be conducted with the owner's knowledge, upon presentation of a 
&gt; search warrant.  Only in the exceptional case of wiretapping, may a 
&gt; person's privacy be invaded by law enforcement without simultaneously 
&gt; informing that person.  
&gt; 	Proposals to regulate the use of cryptography for the sake of law 
&gt; enforcement efficiency should be viewed carefully in the centuries old 
&gt; tradition of privacy protection.
&gt; 
&gt; E.	Voluntary escrow system will not meet law enforcement needs
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	Finally, despite all of the troubling aspects of the Clipper 
&gt; proposal, it is by no means clear that it will even solve the problems 
&gt; that law enforcement has identified.  The major stated rationale for 
&gt; government intervention in the domestic encryption arena is to ensure 
&gt; that law enforcement has access to criminal communications, even if they 
&gt; are encrypted.  Yet, a voluntary scheme seems inadequate to meet this 
&gt; goal.  Criminals who seek to avoid interception and decryption of their 
&gt; communications would simply use another system, free from escrow 
&gt; provisions.  Unless a government-proposed encryption scheme is 
&gt; mandatory, it would fail to achieve its primary law enforcement purpose.  
&gt; In a voluntary regime, only the law-abiding would use the escrow system.  
&gt; 
&gt; III.	Recent policy developments indicate that Administration policy is 
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       bad for the NII, contrary to the Computer Security Act, and 
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       requires Congressional oversight
&gt; --------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	Along with the Clipper Chip proposal, the Administration announced 
&gt; a comprehensive review of cryptography and privacy policy.  Almost 
&gt; immediately after the Clipper announcement, the Digital Privacy and 
&gt; Security Working Group began discussions with the Administration on 
&gt; issues raised by the Clipper proposal and by cryptography in general.  
&gt; Unfortunately, this dialogue has been largely one-sided.  EFF and many 
&gt; other groups have provided extensive input to the Administration, yet 
&gt; the Administration has not reciprocated -- the promised policy report 
&gt; has not been forthcoming.  Moreover, the National Security Agency and 
&gt; the Federal Bureau of Investigation are proceeding unilaterally to 
&gt; implement their own goals in this critical policy area.
&gt; 	Allowing these agencies to proceed unilaterally would be a grave 
&gt; mistake. As this subcommittee is well aware, the Computer Security Act 
&gt; of 1987 clearly established that neither military nor law enforcement 
&gt; agencies are the proper protectors of personal privacy.  When 
&gt; considering the law, Congress asked, "whether it is proper for a super-
&gt; secret agency [the NSA] that operates without public scrutiny to involve 
&gt; itself in domestic activities...?"  The answer was a clear "no."  Recent 
&gt; Administration announcements regarding the Clipper Chip suggest that the 
&gt; principle established in the 1987 Act has been circumvented. 
&gt; 	As important as the principle of civilian control was in 1987, it 
&gt; is even more critical today.  The more individuals around the country 
&gt; come to depend on secure communications to protect their privacy, the 
&gt; more important it is to conduct privacy and security policy dialogues in 
&gt; public, civilian forums.
&gt; 	The NII can grow into the kind of critical, national resource 
&gt; which this Administration seeks to promote only if major changes in 
&gt; current cryptography and privacy policy.  In the absence of such 
&gt; changes, digital technology will continue to rapidly render our 
&gt; commercial activities and communications -- and, indeed, much of our 
&gt; personal lives -- open to scrutiny by strangers.  The Electronic 
&gt; Frontier Foundation believes that Americans must be allowed access 
&gt; to the cryptographic tools necessary to protect their own privacy.
&gt; 	We had hoped that the Administration was committed to making these 
&gt; changes, but several recent developments lead us to fear that the effort 
&gt; has been abandoned, leaving individual agencies to pursue their own 
&gt; policy agendas instead of being guided by a comprehensive policy.  The 
&gt; following issues concern us:
&gt; 
&gt; *	Delayed Cryptography Policy Report
&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The policy analysis called for along with the April 16, 1993 
&gt; Presidential Decision Directive has not been released, though it was 
&gt; promised to have been completed by early fall of 1993.  We had hoped 
&gt; that this report would be the basis for public dialogue on the important 
&gt; privacy, competitiveness, and law enforcement issues raised by 
&gt; cryptography policy.  To date, none of the Administration's policy 
&gt; rationale has been revealed to the public, despite the fact that 
&gt; agencies in the Executive Branch are proceeding with their own plan
&gt; 
&gt; *	Escrowed Encryption Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)      
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       approved against overwhelming weight of public comments
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The Presidential Decision Directive also called for consideration of a 
&gt; Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for key-escrow 
&gt; encryption systems.  This process was to have been one of several 
&gt; forums whereby those concerned about the proposed key-escrow system 
&gt; could voice opinions.  EFF, as well as over 225 of our individual 
&gt; members, raised a number of serious concerns about the draft FIPS in 
&gt; September of this 1993.  EFF expressed its opposition to government 
&gt; implementation of key-escrow systems as proposed.  We continue to 
&gt; oppose the deployment of Skipjack family escrow encryption systems 
&gt; both because they violate fundamental First, Fourth, and Fifth 
&gt; amendment principles, and because they fail to offer users adequate 
&gt; security and flexibility.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite overwhelming opposition from over 300 commenters, the 
&gt; Department of Commerce recently approved FIPS 185.
&gt; 
&gt; *	Large-Scale Skipjack Deployment Announced
&gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; At the December 9, 1993 meeting of the Computer Systems Security and 
&gt; Privacy Advisory Board, an NSA official announced plans to deploy from 
&gt; 10,000 to 70,000 Skipjack devices in the Defense Messaging System in 
&gt; the near future.  The exact size of the order was said to be dependent 
&gt; only on budget constraints.  The Administration is on record in the 
&gt; national press promising that no large-scale Skipjack deployment would 
&gt; occur until a final report of the Administration Task Force was 
&gt; complete.  Ten thousand units was set as the upper limit of initial 
&gt; deployment.  Skipjack deployment at the level planned in the Defense 
&gt; Messaging System circumvents both the FIPS notice and comments process 
&gt; which has been left in a state of limbo, as well as the Administration's 
&gt; promise of a comprehensive policy framework. 
&gt; 
&gt; *	New FBI Digital Telephony Legislation Proposed
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The FBI recently proposed a new "Digital Telephony" bill.  After initial 
&gt; analysis, we strongly oppose the bill, which would require all common 
&gt; carriers to construct their networks to deliver to law enforcement 
&gt; agencies, in real time, both the contents of all communications on their 
&gt; networks and the "signaling" or transactional information. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National 
&gt; Information Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be 
&gt; used by law enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This 
&gt; image is not hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the 
&gt; technology and inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy 
&gt; protections for users of communications networks. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to 
&gt; maintain status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological 
&gt; changes, in fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Lengthy delays on the promised policy report, along with these 
&gt; unilateral steps toward Clipper/Skipjack deployment, lead us to believe 
&gt; that Administration policy is stalled by the Cold War-era national 
&gt; security concerns that have characterized cryptography policy for the 
&gt; last several decades.
&gt; 	EFF believes that it would be a disastrous error to allow national 
&gt; information policy -- now a critical component of domestic policy -- to 
&gt; be dictated solely by backward-looking national-security priorities and 
&gt; unsubstantiated law-enforcement claims.  The directions set by this 
&gt; Administration will have a major impact on privacy, information 
&gt; security, and the fundamental relationship between the government and 
&gt; individual autonomy.  This is why the Administration must take action--
&gt; and do so before the aforementioned agencies proceed further--to ensure 
&gt; that cryptography policy is restructured to serve the 
&gt; interests of privacy and security in the National Information 
&gt; Infrastructure. We still believe the Administration can play the 
&gt; leadership role it was meant to play in shaping this policy. If it does 
&gt; not, the potential of the NII, and of fundamental civil liberties in the 
&gt; information age, will be threatened.
&gt; 
&gt; IV.	Congressional oversight of cryptography &amp; privacy policy is 
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       urgently needed to right the balance between privacy, 
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       competitiveness &amp; law enforcement needs
&gt; ---------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	All participants in this debate recognize that the need for 
&gt; privacy and security is real, and that new technologies pose real 
&gt; challenges for law enforcement and national security operations.  
&gt; However, the solutions now on the table cripple the NII, pose grave 
&gt; threats to privacy, and fail to even meet law enforcement objectives.  
&gt; In our judgment, the Administration has failed, thus far, to articulate 
&gt; a comprehensive set of policies which will advance the goals upon 
&gt; which we all agree.
&gt; 	Congress must act now to ensure that cryptography policy is 
&gt; developed in the context of the broader goal of promoting the 
&gt; development of an advanced, interoperable, secure, information 
&gt; infrastructure.  
&gt; 	In order to meet the privacy and security needs of the growing 
&gt; infrastructure, Congress should seek a set of public policies which 
&gt; promote the widespread availability of cryptographic systems according 
&gt; to the following criteria:
&gt; 
&gt; *	Use Voluntary Standards to Promote Innovation and Meet 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       Diverse Needs: 
&gt; --------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The National Information Infrastructure stretches to 
&gt; encompass devices as diverse as super computers, handheld personal 
&gt; digital assistants and other wireless communications devices, and plain 
&gt; old telephones.  Communication will be carried over copper wires, fiber 
&gt; optic cables, and satellite links.  The users of the infrastructure will 
&gt; range from elementary school children to federal agencies.  Encryption 
&gt; standards must be allowed to develop flexibly to meet the wide-ranging 
&gt; needs all components of the NII.  In its IITF Report, the Administration 
&gt; finds that standards also must be compatible with the large installed 
&gt; base of communications technologies, and flexible and adaptable enough 
&gt; to meet user needs at affordable costs. [_AA_, 9]  The diverse uses of 
&gt; the NII require that any standard which the government seeks to promote 
&gt; as a broadly deployed solution should be implementable in software as 
&gt; well as hardware and based on widely available algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; *	Develop Trusted Algorithms and End-to-End Security:  
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Assuring current and future users of the NII that their communications 
&gt; are 
&gt; secure and their privacy is protected is a critical task.  This means 
&gt; that the 
&gt; underlying algorithms adopted must have a high level of public trust and 
&gt; the overall systems put in place must be secure.
&gt; 
&gt; *	Encourage National and International Interoperability:  
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The promise of the NII is seamless national and international 
&gt; communications of all types.  Any cryptographic standard offered for 
&gt; widespread use must allow US corporations and individuals to function as 
&gt; part of the global economy and global communications infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt; *	Seek Reasonable Cooperation with Law Enforcement and National      
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       Security Needs:  
&gt; ---------------------
&gt; 
&gt; New technologies pose new challenges to law enforcement and national 
&gt; security surveillance activities.  American industry is committed to 
&gt; working with law enforcement to help meet its legitimate surveillance 
&gt; needs, but the development of the NII should not be stalled on this 
&gt; account.
&gt; 
&gt; *	Promote Constitutional Rights of Privacy and Adhere to Traditional 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Fourth Amendment Search and Seizure Rules:  
&gt; ------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; New technology can either be a threat or an aid to protection of 
&gt; fundamental privacy rights.  Government policy should promote 
&gt; technologies which enable individuals to protect their privacy and be 
&gt; sure that those technologies are governed by laws which respect the 
&gt; long history of constitutional search and seizure restraints.
&gt; 
&gt; *	Maintain Civilian Control over Public Computer and

&gt;       Communications Security:  
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; In accordance with the Computer Security Act of 1987, development of 
&gt; security and privacy standards should be directed by the civilian
&gt; 
&gt; V.	Conclusion
&gt; ----------------
&gt; 
&gt; 	Among the most important roles that the federal government has in 
&gt; NII deployment are setting standards and guaranteeing privacy and 
&gt; security.  Without adequate security and privacy, the NII will never 
&gt; realize it economic or social potential.  Cryptography policy must, of 
&gt; course, take into account the needs of law enforcement and national 
&gt; security agencies, but cannot be driven by these concerns alone.  The 
&gt; Working Group, along with other industry and public interest 
&gt; organizations, is committed to working with the Administration to 
&gt; solving the privacy and security questions raised by the growing NII.  
&gt; This must be done based on the principles of voluntary standards, 
&gt; promotion of innovation, concern for law enforcement needs, and 
&gt; protection of constitutional rights of privacy.
