I'm sure you want these wonderful things back, Mr. Detweiler.  I sure
didn't order them.  Don't worry, I didn't read them.  They're still
as good as new.

On the cypherpunks list you excreted:

&gt; The announcement was just made at Networld+Interop '94 in Las Vegas by
&gt; Jeff Schiller, MIT's Network Manager.  The text of the actual
&gt; announcement is available via WWW at <A  HREF="http://www.media.org/">http://www.media.org/</A>.  Look under
&gt; "MIT PGP Security Announcement."
 
&gt; WHAT WAS WRONG WITH 2.2? Damn programers can never do anything
&gt; right the first time?

What was wrong with your first fifty brain-damaged rants today?  Damn 
paranoid schizophrenics never know when to quit...

Now go away, you're cluttering up our mailboxes.

On the cypherpunks list you excreted:

&gt; MIT has just officially announced the upcoming availability of PGP 2.5.
&gt; The announcement was just made at Networld+Interop '94 in Las Vegas by
&gt; Jeff Schiller, MIT's Network Manager.  The text of the actual
&gt; announcement is available via WWW at <A  HREF="http://www.media.org/">http://www.media.org/</A>.  Look under
&gt; "MIT PGP Security Announcement."
 
&gt; WHAT WAS WRONG WITH 2.2? Damn programers can never do anything
&gt; right the first time?

What was wrong with your first fifty brain-damaged rants today?  Damn 
paranoid schizophrenics never know when to quit...

Now go away, you're cluttering up our mailboxes.
