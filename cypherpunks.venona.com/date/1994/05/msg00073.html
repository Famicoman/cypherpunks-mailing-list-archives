	 "Jim Sewell" says:
	 &gt;   A friend of mine that repaired computers said he ran across an
	 &gt;   old disk drive that was used in WWII.

	 There were no disk drives in WWII. There were barely computers. Hell,
	 there was barely magnetic audio storage -- on steel wire!

I sent the same reply privately.  But disks were used in a WWII voice
security system -- phonograph disks...

I just learned about this system a few weeks ago.  As anyone who has
read Kahn knows, the early secure voice systems weren't secure; trained
listeners could even understand the scrambled system.  Some folks at
Bell Labs were asked to design one that would work.

The eventual system -- known as SIGSALY, or as Project X (and the
end units were called X terminals, which is probably the only time
that phrase was ever used for something that is secure...) -- utilized
a vocoder and a one-time pad.  The one-time pad was recorded on two
high-quality phonograph records, each of which held 15 minutes of
keying information.

SIGSALY terminals were quite large -- they took up 30 seven-foot bays.
And they needed a *lot* of air conditioning.  But the system did work,
even over transoceanic radio links.  Churchill had one in his underground
office in London, in fact.

Spectrum Communication'', William R. Bennett, IEEE Trans. on Communications,
Vol 31, No. 1, Jan '83, and ``A History of Engineering and Science in
the Bell System:  National Service in War and Peace (1925-1975)''.
