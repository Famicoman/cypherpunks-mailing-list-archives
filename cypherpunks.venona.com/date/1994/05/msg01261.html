    I read this in the May 2nd issue of Microtimes, and asked the
    author's permission to post it here.  On rereading I think it
    suffers in the transcription, since it was originally a speech.
    And I'm not sure I understand or agree with everything in it.
    But I think it does contain some arguments worth disseminating.

&gt; LITERARY FREEWARE:  NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE
&gt;  
&gt; Remarks at Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference IV
&gt; Chicago, Mar 26, 1994
&gt;  
&gt; 	I've been asked to explain why I don't worry much about the 
&gt; topics of privacy threat raised by this panel.  And I don't.  One reason 
&gt; is that these scenarios seem to assume that there will be large, 
&gt; monolithic bureaucracies (of whatever character, political or 
&gt; economic)  that are capable of harnessing computers for one-way 
&gt; surveillance of an unsuspecting populace.  I've come to feel that 
&gt; computation just doesn't work that way.  Being afraid of monolithic 
&gt; organizations especially when they have computers, is like being 
&gt; afraid of really big gorillas especially when they are on fire.
&gt;  
&gt; 	The threat simply doesn't concur with my historical 
&gt; experience.  None of the large organizations of my youth that 
&gt; compelled my fear and uneasy respect have prospered.  Let me just 
&gt; roll off a few acronyms here.  CCCP.  KGB.  IBM.  GM.  AEC.  SAC.   
&gt;  
&gt; 	It was recently revealed that the CIA has been of actual 
&gt; negative worth -- literally worse than useless -- to American 
&gt; national security.  They were in the pockets of the KGB during our 
&gt; death struggle with the Soviet Union -- and yet we still won.  
&gt; Japanese zaibatsus -- Japan Inc. -- the corporate monoliths of Japan 
&gt; -- how much hype have we heard about that lately?   I admit that 
&gt; AT&amp;T has prospered, sort of -- if you don't count the fact that 
&gt; they've hollowed themselves out by firing a huge percentage of their 
&gt; personnel.  
&gt; 	
&gt; 	Suppose that, say, Equifax, turned into an outright fascist 
&gt; organization and stated abusing privacy in every way they could.  
&gt; How could they keep that a secret?  Realistically, given current 
&gt; employment practices in the Western economies, what kind of 
&gt; loyalty could they command among their own personnel?  The low 
&gt; level temps have no health insurance and no job security; the high 
&gt; level people are ready to grab their golden parachutes and bail at any 
&gt; time.  Where is the fanatically loyal army of gray flannel 
&gt; organization men who will swear lifelong allegiance to this 
&gt; organization, or *any* organization in this country with the possible 
&gt; exception of the Mafia?
&gt;  
&gt; 	I feel that the real threat to our society isn't because people 
&gt; are being surveilled but because people are being deliberately 
&gt; ignored.  People drop through the safety nets.  People stumble 
&gt; through the streets of every city in this country absolutely wrapped 
&gt; in the grip of demons, groping at passersby for a moment's attention 
&gt; and pity and not getting it.  In parts of the Third World people are 
&gt; routinely disappeared, not because of high-tech computer 
&gt; surveillance but for the most trivial and insane reasons -- because 
&gt; they wear glasses, because they were seen reading a book -- and if 
&gt; they survive, it's because of the thin thread of surveillance carried 
&gt; out by Amnesty International.
&gt;  
&gt; 	There may be securicams running 24 hours a day all around us, 
&gt; but mechanical surveillance is not the same as people actually 
&gt; getting attention or care.  Sure, rich people, like most of us here, are 
&gt; gonna get plenty of attention, probably too much, a poisonous 
&gt; amount, but in the meantime life has become so cheap in this society 
&gt; that we let people stagger around right in front of us exhaling 
&gt; tuberculosis without treatment.  It's not so much information haves 
&gt; and have-nots and watch and watch-nots.
&gt;  
&gt; 	I wish I could speak at greater length more directly to the 
&gt; topic of this panel.  But since I'm the last guy to officially speak at 
&gt; CFP IV, I want the seize the chance to grandstand and do a kind of 
&gt; pontifical summation of the event.  And get some irrepressible 
&gt; feelings off my chest.
&gt;  
&gt; 	What am I going to remember from CFP IV?  I'm going to 
&gt; remember the Chief Counsel of NSA and his impassioned insistence 
&gt; that key escrow cryptography represents normality and the status 
&gt; quo, and that unlicensed hard cryptography is a rash and radical leap 
&gt; into unplumbed depths of lawlessness.  He made a literary reference 
&gt; to BRAVE NEW WORLD.  What he said in so many words was, "We're 
&gt; not the Brave New World, Clipper's opponents are the Brave New 
&gt; World."
&gt;  
&gt; 	And I believe he meant that.  As a professional science fiction 
&gt; writer I remember being immediately struck by the deep conviction 
&gt; that there was plenty of Brave New World to go around.
&gt;  
&gt; 	I've been to all four CFPs, and in my opinion this is the darkest 
&gt; one by far.  I hear ancestral voices prophesying war.  All previous 
&gt; CFPs had a weird kind of camaraderie about them.  People from the 
&gt; most disparate groups found something useful to tell each other.  
&gt; But now that America's premiere spookocracy has arrived on stage 
&gt; and spoken up, I think the CFP community has finally found a group of 
&gt; outsiders that it cannot metabolize.  The trenchworks are going up 
&gt; and I see nothing but confrontation ahead.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Senator Leahy at least had the elementary good sense to 
&gt; backpedal and temporize, as any politician would when he saw the 
&gt; white-hot volcano of technological advance in the direct path of a 
&gt; Cold War glacier that has previously crushed everything in its way.  
&gt;  
&gt; 	But that unlucky flak-catcher the White House sent down here 
&gt; -- that guy was mousetrapped, basically.  That was a debacle!  Who 
&gt; was briefing that guy?  Are they utterly unaware?  How on earth 
&gt; could they miss the fact that Clipper and Digital Telephony are 
&gt; violently detested by every element in this community -- with the 
&gt; possible exception of one brave little math professor this high?  
&gt; Don't they get it that everybody from Rush Limbaugh to Timothy 
&gt; Leary despises this initiative?  Don't they read newspapers?   The 
&gt; Wall Street Journal, The New York Times?  I won't even ask if they 
&gt; read their email.
&gt;  
&gt; 	That was bad politics.  But that was nothing compared to the 
&gt; presentation by the gentleman from the NSA.  If I can do it without 
&gt; losing my temper, I want to talk to you a little bit about how 
&gt; radically unsatisfactory that was.
&gt;  
&gt; 	I've been waiting a long time for somebody from Fort Meade to 
&gt; come to the aid of Dorothy Denning in Professor Denning's heroic and 
&gt; heartbreaking solo struggle against twelve million other people with 
&gt; email addresses.  And I listened very carefully and I took notes and I 
&gt; swear to God I even applauded at the end.  
&gt;  
&gt; 	He had seven points to make, four of which were disingenuous, 
&gt; two were half-truths, and the other was the actual core of the 
&gt; problem.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Let me blow away some of the smoke and mirrors first, more 
&gt; for my own satisfaction than because it's going to enlighten you 
&gt; people any.  With your indulgence.  
&gt;  
&gt; 	First, the kidporn thing.  I am sick and tired of hearing this 
&gt; specious blackwash.  Are American citizens really so neurotically 
&gt; uptight about deviant sexual behavior that we will allow our entire 
&gt; information infrastructure to be dictated by the existence of 
&gt; pedophiles?  Are pedophiles that precious and important to us?  Do 
&gt; the NSA and the FBI really believe that they can hide the structure of 
&gt; a telephone switch under a layer of camouflage called child 
&gt; pornography?   Are we supposed to flinch so violently at the specter 
&gt; of child abuse that we somehow miss the fact that you've installed a 
&gt; Sony Walkman jack in our phones?
&gt;  
&gt; 	Look, there were pedophiles before NII and there will be 
&gt; pedophiles long after NII is just another dead acronym.  Pedophiles 
&gt; don't jump out of BBSes like jacks in the box.  You want to impress 
&gt; me with your deep concern for children?  This is Chicago!  Go down 
&gt; to the Projects and rescue some children from being terrorized and 
&gt; recruited by crack gangs who wouldn't know a modem if it bit them 
&gt; on the ass!  Stop pornkidding us around!  Just knock it off with that 
&gt; crap, you're embarrassing yourselves.
&gt;  
&gt; 	But back to the speech by Mr. Baker of the NSA.  Was it just me, 
&gt; ladies and gentlemen, or did anyone else catch that tone of truly 
&gt; intolerable arrogance?  Did they guy have to make the remark about 
&gt; our missing Woodstock because we were busy with our 
&gt; trigonometry?  Do spook mathematicians permanently cooped up 
&gt; inside Fort Meade consider that a funny remark?  I'd like to make an 
&gt; even more amusing observation -- that I've seen scarier secret 
&gt; police agencies than his completely destroyed by a Czech hippie 
&gt; playwright with a manual typewriter.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Is the NSA unaware that the current President of the United 
&gt; States once had a big bushel-basket-full of hair?  What does he 
&gt; expect from the computer community?  Normality?  Sorry pal, we're 
&gt; fresh out!   Who is it, exactly, that the NSA considers a level-headed 
&gt; sober sort, someone to sit down with and talk to seriously?  Jobs?  
&gt; Wozniak?  Gates?  Sculley?  Perot -- I hope to God it's not Perot.  
&gt; Bob Allen -- okay, maybe Bob Allen, that brownshoe guy from AT&amp;T.  
&gt; Bob Allen seems to think that Clipper is a swell idea, at least he's 
&gt; somehow willing to merchandise it.  But Christ, Bob Allen just gave 
&gt; eight zillion dollars to a guy whose idea of a good time is Microsoft 
&gt; Windows for Spaceships!
&gt;  
&gt; 	When is the NSA going to realize that Kapor and his people and 
&gt; Rotenberg and his people and the rest of the people here are as good 
&gt; as people get in this milieu?  Yes they are weird people, and yes they 
&gt; have weird friends (and I'm one of them), but there isn't any 
&gt; normality left for anybody in this society, and when it comes to 
&gt; computers, when the going got weird the weird turned pro!  The 
&gt; status quo is *over!*  Wake up to it!  Get used to it!
&gt;  
&gt; 	Where in hell does a crowd of spooks from Fort Meade get off 
&gt; playing "responsible adults" in this situation?  This is a laugh and a 
&gt; half!  Bobby Ray Inman, the legendary NSA leader, made a stab at 
&gt; computer entrepreneurism and rapidly went down for the third time.   
&gt; Then he got out of the shadows of espionage and into the bright 
&gt; lights of actual public service and immediately started gabbling like 
&gt; a daylight-stricken vampire.  Is this the kind of responsive public 
&gt; official we're expected to blindly trust with the insides of our 
&gt; phones and computers?  Who made him God?
&gt;  
&gt; 	You know, it's a difficult confession for a practiced cynic like 
&gt; me to make, but I actually trust EFF people.  I do; I trust them;  
&gt; there, I've said it.   But I wouldn't trust Bobby Ray Inman to go down 
&gt; to the corner store for a pack of cigarettes.
&gt;  
&gt; 	You know, I like FBI people.  I even kind of trust them, sort of, 
&gt; kind of, a little bit.  I'm sorry that they didn't catch Kevin Mitnick 
&gt; here.  I'm even sorry that they didn't manage to apprehend Robert 
&gt; Steele, who is about one hundred times as smart as Mitnick and ten 
&gt; thousand times as dangerous.   But FBI people, I think your idea of 
&gt; Digital Telephony is a scarcely mitigated disaster, and I'll tell you 
&gt; why.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Because you're going to be filling out your paperwork in 
&gt; quintuplicate to get a tap, just like you always do, because you don't 
&gt; have your own pet court like the NSA does.  And for you, it probably 
&gt; is going to seem pretty much like the status quo used to be.  But in 
&gt; the meantime, you will have armed the enemies of the United States 
&gt; around the world with a terrible weapon.  Not your court-ordered, 
&gt; civilized Digital Telephony -- their raw and tyrannical Digital 
&gt; Telephony.
&gt;  
&gt; 	You're gonna be using it to round up wiseguys in streetgangs, 
&gt; and people like Saddam Hussein are gonna be using it to round up 
&gt; democratic activists and national minorities.  You're going to 
&gt; strengthen the hand of despotism around the world, and then you're 
&gt; going to have to deal with the hordes of state-supported 
&gt; truckbombers these rogue governments are sending our way after 
&gt; annihilating their own internal opposition by using your tools.  You 
&gt; want us to put an axe in your hand and you're promising to hit us 
&gt; with only the flat side of it, but the Chinese don't see it that way;  
&gt; they're already licensing fax machines and they're gonna need a lot 
&gt; of new hardware to gear up for Tiananmen II.
&gt;  
&gt; 	I've talked a long time, but I want to finish by saying 
&gt; something about the NSA guy's one real and actual argument.  The 
&gt; terrors of the Brave New World of free individual encryption.  When 
&gt; he called encryption enthusiasts "romantic" he was dead-on, and 
&gt; when he said the results of spreading encryption were unpredictable 
&gt; and dangerous he was also dead-on, because people, encryption is not 
&gt; our friend.  Encryption is a mathematical technique, and it has about 
&gt; as much concern for our human well-being as the fact that seventeen 
&gt; times seventeen equals two hundred and eighty-nine.  It does, but 
&gt; that doesn't make us sleep any safer in our beds.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Encrypted networks worry the hell out of me and they have 
&gt; since the mid 1980s.  The effects are very scary and very 
&gt; unpredictable and could be very destabilizing.  But even the Four 
&gt; Horsemen of Kidporn, Dope Dealers, Mafia and Terrorists don't worry 
&gt; me as much as totalitarian governments.  It's been a long century, 
&gt; and we've had enough of them.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Our battle this century against totalitarianism has left 
&gt; terrible scars all over our body politic and the threat these people 
&gt; pose to us is entirely and utterly predictable.   You can say that the 
&gt; devil we know is better than the devil we don't, but the devils we 
&gt; knew were ready to commit genocide, litter the earth with dead, and 
&gt; blow up the world.  How much worse can that get?  Let's not build 
&gt; chips and wiring for our police and spies when only their police and 
&gt; spies can reap the full benefit of them.
&gt;  
&gt; 	But I don't expect my arguments to persuade anyone in the NSA.  
&gt; If you're NSA and I do somehow convince you, by some fluke, then I 
&gt; urge you to look at your conscience -- I know you have one -- and 
&gt; take the word to your superiors and if they don't agree with you -- 
&gt; *resign.*  Leave the Agency.  Resign now, and if I'm right about 
&gt; what's coming down the line, you'll be glad you didn't wait till later. 
&gt;  
&gt; 	But even though I have a good line of gab, I don't expect to 
&gt; actually argue people out of their livelihood.  That's notoriously 
&gt; difficult.
&gt;  
&gt; 	So CFP people, you have a fight on your hands.  I'm sorry that a 
&gt; community this young should have to face a fight this savage, for 
&gt; such terribly high stakes, so soon.   But what the heck;  you're 
&gt; always bragging about how clever you are; here's your chance to 
&gt; prove to your fellow citizens that you're more than a crowd of net-
&gt; nattering MENSA dilettantes.  In cyberspace one year is like seven 
&gt; dog years, and on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog, so I figure 
&gt; that makes you CFP people twenty-eight years old.   And people, for 
&gt; the sake of our society and our children you had better learn to act 
&gt; your age.
&gt;  
&gt; 	Good luck.  Good luck to you.  For what it's worth, I think you're 
&gt; some of the best and brightest our society has to offer.  Things look 
&gt; dark but I feel hopeful.  See you next year in San Francisco.
&gt;
