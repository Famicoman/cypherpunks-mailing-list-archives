&gt; From: Black Unicorn
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to me like the Jeffersonian notion that the Constitution
&gt; should be amended in every generation.  Letter to Samuel Kercheval, July
&gt; 12 1816, The Portable Thomas Jefferson 557-558 (M. Peterson ed. 1975).
&gt; I think this is perhaps excessive, and if you consider the effect of short
&gt; term politics, one could well find his or her own generation is the one which
&gt; does away with the 4th and 5th amendments because of a "Crime Crisis."
&gt; 
&gt; If your suggestion is more along the lines of a more reasoned and
&gt; enduring amendment process with some respect for the concepts of old and
&gt; more importantly an attempt to adapt the spirit of the document [the 
&gt; Constitution] to the reality of the day, I concur wholeheartedly.
&gt; ...................................................
&gt; 
&gt; No, it has nothing to do with the amendment process; it has to do with 
&gt; original thought.
&gt; 
&gt; As long as the people of today or tomorrow remain attached to a 
&gt; document,  becoming dependent upon it for their thinking, then they are 
&gt; still not free, because - especially in the case of the Constitution - 
&gt; they have still not understood the message.  The principle of 
&gt; individuality and freedom from government coercion means that an 
&gt; individual can make up their own mind, can use their own judgement, and 
&gt; can decide for themselves whether or not they will become a member of 
&gt; an institution - even if that institution is already in existence 
&gt; surrounding them and it seems that it is no longer required of them to 
&gt; think about making a choice regarding their relationship to it, that 
&gt; the choice was already made for them a long time ago and the situation 
&gt; no longer requires their input  -  almost as if their opinion were 
&gt; irrelevant, almost as if that which was created in the past had nothing 
&gt; to do with them in the present.
&gt; 
&gt; If no one from an institution inquires whether you want to join, but 
&gt; takes it for granted that you are a member and then proceeds to treat 
&gt; you like citizen, then they have not been respectful of your 
&gt; independent ability to make up your own mind, apart from their ability 
&gt; to make that decision for you.  This is not in the spirit of the 
&gt; Constitution.
&gt; 
&gt; The age of the concept is not what is important; it is the principle 
&gt; elucidated.  Any document which presents important concepts is 
&gt; valuable.   It isn't requisite, however, that one remain attached to it 
&gt; in order to reap the benefit of its wisdom;  it is more important to 
&gt; recognize that to which the wisdom therein refers,  and once the ideas 
&gt; have been digested &amp; comprehended, to advance using the perspicacity 
&gt; which you should have developed from their study.
&gt; 
&gt; My point in this discussion is only to say that in terms of a contract, 
&gt; no one is really provided the opportunity to "sign the deal", so to 
&gt; speak.  Too much is taken for granted, and therefore too many mistakes 
&gt; are made from the absence of a foundation based upon actual agreements 
&gt; made (rather than assumed agreement).
&gt; 
&gt; Blanc
