Mike Duvos scripsit
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have to support Black Unicorn's use of the courts.
&gt; &gt; Really, what choices were available?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, I, for one, think Black Unicorn took the best and most
&gt; &gt; reasonable approach.  I'd be very interested in which course
&gt; &gt; (or some other undefined course I didn't think of) that
&gt; &gt; the anarchists feel would be reasonable...
&gt; 
&gt; Let's see.  I didn't read the thread in question but am reasonably 
&gt; familiar with the unsavory debating tactics of Mr. Tmp from other 
&gt; discussions.  
&gt; 
&gt; As I understand it, Mr. Unicorn and Mr. Tmp, their true identities safely
&gt; concealed behind their respective handles, engaged in a minor flame war
&gt; and major ass-kicking contest related to the topics of crypto, privacy,
&gt; and nasty authoritarian governments.  Mr. Tmp, following his usual modus 
&gt; operandi, engaged in some reasonably clever hand-waving, out-of-context 
&gt; quoting, misdirection, and misrepresentation at the expense of a number 
&gt; of people, including Mr. Unicorn.
&gt; 
&gt; All this would have been water under the bridge were it not for the fact 
&gt; that Mr. Unicorn, who is wont to travel in circles considerably more 
&gt; conservative than most of his political writings, inadvertantly disclosed 
&gt; his identity in the thread while showing a friend how to use Usenet.  
&gt; Certainly this blunder was no fault of Mr. Tmp.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately, as a consequence of this leak, certain business associates of
&gt; Mr. Unicorn, with no knowlege of Usenet or the context of the discussion,
&gt; were exposed to portions of it and the identity of Mr. Unicorn was
&gt; disclosed.  Again no fault of Mr. Tmp.
&gt; 
&gt; Said business associates, being relatively anal upper-class European 
&gt; types with a great respect for authority, were singularly unamused by
&gt; Mr. Unicorn's political views and the even worse things falsely 
&gt; attributed to him by Mr. Tmp in the heat of discussion.  Mr. Unicorn 
&gt; became worried that his business might suffer as a consequence.  Since I 
&gt; personally believe that one should not discriminate in doing business 
&gt; based on someones political beliefs, I would certainly characterize this 
&gt; as a moral failure on the part of Mr. Unicorn's business associates, and 
&gt; not the fault of Mr. Tmp.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, Mr. Unicorn, mustering all the legal and financial resources at
&gt; his disposal, threatens to skewer Mr. Tmp for alleged libel, and Mr. Tmp,
&gt; lacking similar resources and unable to risk a courtroom defeat, is forced
&gt; to go on Usenet and publicly eat you-know-what with a large wooden spoon. 
&gt; 
&gt; Since Mr. Tmp is not well-liked in the Cypherpunk community, response to 
&gt; this sorted tale consists mostly of praise for Mr. Unicorn, and silence 
&gt; by those who might have been critical, but who don't want Mr. Unicorn to 
&gt; treat them the same way.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think there are any heros in this story.  I think it is a dark 
&gt; day for freedom of expression in general and Usenet in particular.  
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, I have engaged in lots of heated discussions on many 
&gt; hot-button topics, on Usenet and in many other forums, sometimes under my 
&gt; own name, and occasionally under a pseudonym.  I have been called many 
&gt; vile things along the way, and have had my views on occasion 
&gt; misrepresented far more cleverly than Mr. Tmp could imagine or articulate.
&gt; 
&gt; Nonetheless, if I found myself losing work because an unpopular view of
&gt; mine came to light, filing a lawsuit against another Usenet poster would
&gt; be just about the last thing I would think of doing.  Particularly if the
&gt; discussion took place under a pseudonym and I was the person who had 
&gt; broken my own anonymity.
&gt; 
&gt; Antics like this threaten the entire concept of Usenet as a 
&gt; reputation-based cooperative anarchy.  The solution to Mr. Tmp is to put 
&gt; him in your killfile, not sue him into submission.
