&gt; I. INTRODUCTION
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for inviting the National Institute of Standards and
&gt; Technology (NIST) to speak about security of the Internet and the
&gt; role NIST plays in its security.  We share your belief in the
&gt; importance of security on the Internet.  We also believe that
&gt; recent events affecting the security of Internet users reinforce
&gt; the need for attention and action.  I want to address the
&gt; specific concerns and issues you have identified and discuss the
&gt; role that NIST plays in the security of both the Internet and the
&gt; evolving national information infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt; A. NIST's Computer Security Mission
&gt; 
&gt; First, let me briefly review NIST's role in the computer security
&gt; area. Under the Brooks Act (P.L. 89-306), NIST is tasked with
&gt; developing Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for
&gt; unclassified federal computer systems.  Our security activities
&gt; in this area were re-enforced by Congress in 1987 when it passed
&gt; the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235).  The Act
&gt; stipulates that NIST shall "have responsibility within the
&gt; Federal Government for developing technical, management,
&gt; physical, and administrative standards and guidelines for the
&gt; cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive information in
&gt; Federal computer systems" (excepting classified systems and those
&gt; used to process "Warner Amendment" information covered by 10
&gt; U.S.C. 2315).  This role was essentially reiterated in P.L. 102-
&gt; 194, the High-performance Computing Act of 1991.
&gt; 
&gt; In essence, then, NIST has the responsibility -- through
&gt; standards, guidance, and technology transfer -- for helping
&gt; agencies protect their information technology and applications. 
&gt; It is important to recognize that it remains the responsibility
&gt; of agencies, service providers, and users of information
&gt; technology to develop, implement, and manage security programs
&gt; based on their specific risks and needs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; II. THE RECENT INTERNET SECURITY INCIDENT
&gt; 
&gt; Let me now turn briefly to the recent incident that was perhaps
&gt; the primary impetus for  these hearings.  The testimony of the
&gt; representative from the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
&gt; describes the technical details of the incident.  I will try to
&gt; put the incident in a context and perspective.  Later, I will
&gt; address more general Internet and NII security concerns.
&gt; 
&gt; A. The Incident
&gt; 
&gt; The recent incident involved the discovery of "password sniffer"
&gt; programs on hundreds of systems throughout the Internet.  This
&gt; "incident" was really a series of incidents on host systems
&gt; around the Internet involving the exploitation of a combination
&gt; of vulnerabilities present in the Internet.  First, I should note
&gt; that over the last few years there have been many security alerts
&gt; and incidents involving systems on the Internet.  This incident
&gt; was different from  "routine" or ongoing incidents primarily in
&gt; that it developed rapidly into a widespread pattern of similar
&gt; attacks and that it resulted in threats to many other systems.  
&gt; 
&gt; B. Major Vulnerabilities Exploited
&gt; 
&gt; There were two major types of vulnerability that were exploited
&gt; in this incident -- neither, by the way, being actual
&gt; vulnerabilities of the Internet itself, but rather problems in
&gt; systems connected to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; Obtaining Privileged Access - The first step in the password
&gt; sniffer attack requires the attacker to obtain privileged status
&gt; on a target host system.  This can be done by exploiting any of a
&gt; wide range of known attacks.  This normally can happen only when
&gt; that host system has not been properly configured and
&gt; administered to prevent unauthorized access.  As such, this is
&gt; not an Internet vulnerability.  Rather, it is a general problem
&gt; that all computer system administrators face and must address.
&gt; 
&gt; Access to Passwords - The next steps in the attack involve the
&gt; installation of the "sniffer" program to monitor the system's
&gt; network interface port and the collection of log-in information,
&gt; including passwords.  The problem was not the ability of a
&gt; properly authorized user to monitor the network port; this is
&gt; needed for effective system administration.  The vulnerability
&gt; here was due to the fact that most computer systems on the
&gt; Internet (and other networks) employ re-usable passwords to
&gt; authenticate users.  There was no exposure for host systems or
&gt; user accounts which employed non-reusable passwords or other
&gt; advanced methods (such as tokens or "smart cards") for user
&gt; authentication.   This, again, is not an Internet vulnerability;
&gt; Internet protocols do not require host systems to use passwords
&gt; for user authentication.  It should also be noted that encryption
&gt; of network layer information would not have solved this specific
&gt; problem, because the monitoring occurs at a point in the
&gt; compromised systems where messages are unencrypted anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, while there were known vulnerabilities exploited in
&gt; this incident, they were vulnerabilities in the security
&gt; mechanisms of host systems, not the Internet itself.  
&gt; Nevertheless, there was a serious and widespread impact of the
&gt; incident affecting many other systems on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; C. Impact
&gt; 
&gt; The serious impact of the recent incident should be recognized;
&gt; log-in information (i.e., account numbers and passwords) for
&gt; potentially thousands of host system user accounts appear to have
&gt; been compromised.  It is clear that this incident had a negative
&gt; impact on the operational missions of some Government agencies. 
&gt; Moreover, this should be viewed as ongoing incident, not an
&gt; incident that has happend and been dealt with.  Indeed,
&gt; administrators of systems throughout the Internet were advised,
&gt; in turn, to direct their users to change their passwords.  This
&gt; is, indeed, very significant, and we may be seeing its effects
&gt; for some time to come.  Not only is it difficult, if not
&gt; impossible, to identify and notify every user whose log-in
&gt; information might have been compromised, it is unlikely that
&gt; everyone, even if notified, will change his or her passwords. 
&gt; Therefore, we will probably continue to see unauthorized access
&gt; to user accounts resulting from the password "sniffing" activity
&gt; of this incident.  Clearly, we need ways to minimize this kind of
&gt; problem in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; D. Alerting and Response to the Incident
&gt; 
&gt; A Success Story - Despite the serious impact of this incident, it
&gt; should be viewed as a clear and major success for organized
&gt; incident response activities.  The existence and cooperation of
&gt; several operational security incident response teams was
&gt; instrumental in identifying this as more than a "routine"
&gt; incident and ensuring rapid response to it.   A formal coalition
&gt; of response teams, known as FIRST (the Forum of Incident Response
&gt; and Security Teams) played an important role in the process.  All
&gt; of the teams central to the incident are members of FIRST.  The
&gt; Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory Capability
&gt; (CIAC) at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory first identified the
&gt; incident.  CERT led efforts to analyize and assess the emerging
&gt; threat and issued initial alert messages to the other security
&gt; incident response teams that are members of FIRST (including
&gt; NIST).  Individual teams then spread the word among their
&gt; constituencies.  Also of particular note was the DoD Automated
&gt; System Security Incident Support Team (ASSIST), which has
&gt; coordinated world-wide response efforts for all of DoD.  When it
&gt; was clear that the incident was particularly wide-spread, notices
&gt; were posted on several Internet "bulletin boards" and other
&gt; forums.  A press release was also issued.  (It is important to
&gt; note, however, that, because of the specific and inherently
&gt; technical nature of most such incidents, press releases are not
&gt; normally part of the alert process.)
&gt; 
&gt; E. Lessons Learned
&gt; 
&gt; This incident was the result of known vulnerabilities and
&gt; already-hypothesized attack scenarios.  Rather than teach us new
&gt; lessons, it really re-emphasizes some lessons we've already
&gt; learned and simply increases a sense of urgency for advanced
&gt; authentication methods and other actions.  Additional lessons
&gt; learned were:
&gt; 
&gt;       Effective incident response teams and alerting mechanisms
&gt;      can (and, in this case, did) play an important role in
&gt;      minimizing the impact of such incidents.
&gt; 
&gt;       Traditional user authentication by means of re-usable
&gt;      passwords does not provide strong security in today's
&gt;      networked environment -- with or without encryption.
&gt; 
&gt;       Exploitation techniques (and software which automates such
&gt;      techniques) are rapidly shared across the network and can be
&gt;      easily used by otherwise unskilled miscreants.  In other
&gt;      words, you don't have to be smart (or ambitious) enough to
&gt;      build these "weapons" to be able to obtain them and use them
&gt;      against others.
&gt; 
&gt;       Any host system, if improperly configured or managed, can
&gt;      become an "unwitting" platform for an attack against other
&gt;      systems in a network.  Therefore, we need to mimimize the
&gt;      need for reliance on the integrity of individual hosts for
&gt;      the security of other hosts and users on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;       System administrators (which, because of the growing
&gt;      number of workstations on the net, include an increasing
&gt;      number of relatively unskilled users) need better awareness,
&gt;      skills, and competence in protecting their systems;
&gt; 
&gt;       The importance of security to users of the Internet (and
&gt;      by extension the evolving national information
&gt;      infrastructure) can no longer be seen as secondary.  If this
&gt;      valuable national resource is to achieve its full potential,
&gt;      its users must have confidence in the security of their data
&gt;      and activities on the network.
&gt; 
&gt; III. IMPROVING SECURITY ON THE INTERNET
&gt; 
&gt; Clearly, much can be done to improve security in the Internet. 
&gt; The initial, research-oriented Internet and its protocols were
&gt; designed for a more "benign" environment than now exists.  It
&gt; could, perhaps, be described as a collegial environment in which
&gt; the users and host computer systems are mutually trusting and
&gt; interested in unrestrained sharing of information.  The new
&gt; environment in which the Internet (and the NII) must operate is
&gt; much less collegial and trustworthy.  It contains all the
&gt; situations, people, and risks that we find in the society as a
&gt; whole.  Thus, we have begun to reexamine and adjust our "design
&gt; requirments" to reflect those new realities.  Security is now a
&gt; primary concern.  The collegial Internet of the past cannot be
&gt; the basis for the NII of the future.
&gt; 
&gt; A. A Short History of Internet Security Incidents
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the previous comment, security in the Internet is not
&gt; something that has never occurred to its users and operators.  It
&gt; is important to understand what has taken place and what is
&gt; currently underway.
&gt; 
&gt; In recent years, a number of security problems with networks in
&gt; general and the Internet in particular have received public
&gt; attention.  The media have carried stories of high-profile
&gt; malicious hacker attacks via the Internet against government,
&gt; business, and academic sites.  It often seems that hackers roam
&gt; the Internet with virtual impunity, masking their tracks while
&gt; moving from system to system.
&gt; 
&gt; The Recent Incident Wasn't the First - Perhaps the first and
&gt; still most significant major incident involving the Internet was
&gt; the so-called Internet Worm, caused by Robert Morris, Jr. in
&gt; November of 1988.  This incident, in effect, woke up the Internet
&gt; community to at least three facts:
&gt; 
&gt;       Everyone out there isn't a "good guy";
&gt; 
&gt;       Internet protocols and applications had many inherent or
&gt;      implementation vulnerabilities that create exposures to
&gt;      misuse or intrusion; and
&gt; 
&gt;       The network community needed better methods of cooperation
&gt;      to identify and react to network incidents and emergencies.
&gt; 
&gt; The first two of the above factors won't change; the last remains
&gt; true, but has been and continues to be addressed.
&gt; 
&gt; And It Won't Be The Last - In the years subsequent to the
&gt; Internet Worm, there have been some significant trends:
&gt; 
&gt;       Use of the Internet has grown exponentially -- and
&gt;      continues unabated.  With this has come a corresponding
&gt;      increase in the number of people with a detailed technical
&gt;      understanding of Internet systems -- and the potential
&gt;      vulnerabilities of those systems. 
&gt; 
&gt;       "Security" incidents, such as attempted system access,
&gt;      actual system intrusions, and other exploitations of various
&gt;      weaknesses of systems on the Internet, also have grown
&gt;      dramatically.  It is likely that almost every host system on
&gt;      the Internet already has had at least some sort of security-
&gt;      related incident.
&gt; 
&gt;       The number of unskilled users who must (or should) be
&gt;      assuming network system administrator functions will
&gt;      continue to increase -- simply because the number of systems
&gt;      connected to the Internet is increasing.
&gt; 
&gt;       There are now growing organized efforts of Internet user
&gt;      organizations to identify and deal with intrusions and
&gt;      unauthorized system use.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; B. Internet Vulnerabilities vs. Host System Vulnerabilities
&gt; 
&gt; It is important to recognize that the vast majority of security
&gt; problems seen "on the Internet" are not really Internet problems
&gt; at all.  We need to understand a subtle but important distinction
&gt; between the Internet and its host systems.
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet is, in essence, a collection of computers, usually
&gt; called host systems, which are connected to underlying data
&gt; communications networks.  These host systems (which may support
&gt; one or more human users) communicate with each other by means of
&gt; internet protocols.  The internet protocols may be thought of as
&gt; the standard message formats by which the host systems establish
&gt; connections to each other and exchange information -- much like
&gt; the use of standard forms and procedures in an office
&gt; environment.
&gt; 
&gt; Security vulnerabilities can exist in the underlying
&gt; communications network and its nodes, in the internet protocols,
&gt; in network administration, or in host systems.  To use the
&gt; highway analogy, a communications problem might be like a
&gt; pothole, a bridge failure, or a closed road.  A protocol problem
&gt; might be like a mis-marked exit sign or a failure of slower
&gt; traffic to stay in the slow lane.  A network administration
&gt; problem might be the lack of emergency vehicle access or
&gt; notification and response procedures for accidents.  Last, a host
&gt; system problem might be likened to a store proprietor along the
&gt; highway leaving the doors open and the store unoccupied.  The
&gt; problem is not the proximity of the highway, but the carelessness
&gt; of the store proprietor (and the fact that not everyone on the
&gt; highway is honest).  Most "Internet" security problems to date
&gt; have been careless -- or unknowlegeable -- proprietors.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; C. The Role of the Internet in the NII
&gt; 
&gt; The national information infrastructure is not some system that
&gt; will be "switched on" at some specified date in the future.  The
&gt; NII, at least in its initial form, is here now, and like many
&gt; other national infrastructures, is made up of many -- often
&gt; disjoint -- elements.  The issues that we in government and
&gt; industry must address are the directions in which we want the NII
&gt; to evolve and how to make that happen.  In the administration's
&gt; guiding document on the development of the NII, The National
&gt; Information Infrastructure: Agenda for Action, one of the nine
&gt; guiding objectives is to "Ensure Information Security and Network
&gt; Reliability".
&gt; 
&gt; One of the important elements in the current NII is the Internet. 
&gt; The Internet may not, however, be the ultimate model or
&gt; technology for the NII.  Nevertheless, it serves important roles
&gt; in the evolution of the NII.  First, it is a working example of
&gt; effective global computer networking.  Second, it is a possible
&gt; model for future network technology.  Last -- and perhaps most
&gt; importantly -- the Internet serves as a sort of living laboratory
&gt; in which we can develop and experiment with technologies,
&gt; applications, and concepts of information sharing that will be
&gt; useful or necessary in the next century.  Again, security
&gt; mechanisms are central to the process.
&gt; 
&gt; D. The National Performance Review
&gt; 
&gt; The importance of information technology security in general and
&gt; Internet security in particular was recognized in the Vice
&gt; President's National Performance Review.  In the area of
&gt; information technology security, the following primary objectives
&gt; were identified:
&gt; 
&gt;       Development of cryptographic standards
&gt;       Development of a set of generally-accepted system security
&gt;      practices
&gt;       Establishment of a national crisis response clearinghouse
&gt;       Improved security awareness
&gt;       Security of the public switched telecommunications network
&gt;       Internet security
&gt;       Coordinated security research and development
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, the NPR report cited specific objectives in the
&gt; related area of Privacy: 
&gt;       Establishment of a Privacy Protection Board
&gt;       Development of a set of Fair Information Handling
&gt; Practices
&gt; 
&gt; NIST has the lead responsibility in some of these items and a
&gt; role in all of them.  Although each has some relevance to
&gt; Internet security, two items are of particular relevance.
&gt; 
&gt; Internet Security - This specifically focuses on the Internet. 
&gt; It involves the development of an overall Internet security plan. 
&gt; The Federal Networking Council has the lead in this activity,
&gt; with the participation of several other organizations, including
&gt; NIST.
&gt; 
&gt; National Crisis Response Clearinghouse - This will be, in
&gt; essence, the expansion and application of the FIRST concept to
&gt; the entire Federal Government.  NIST has the lead responsibility
&gt; for this item.
&gt; 
&gt; E. A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
&gt; 
&gt; One of the clear directions of the administration is for agencies
&gt; to "get connected".  Initially, that means electronic mail, and
&gt; to most agencies, that means "on the Internet".  This presents us
&gt; with an interesting situation.  For years, the reason that many
&gt; agencies used as a reason not to connect to the Internet was
&gt; concern over security -- "We don't want to open ourselves up to
&gt; hackers."  Now, agencies are likely to rush headlong "onto the
&gt; Internet" without careful planning, personnel skills, and
&gt; knowledge of the security considerations.  The likely result, if
&gt; we are not careful, is that we will see significant occurrences
&gt; of those security problems that the agencies were always worried
&gt; about -- a self-fulfilling prophecy.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not to suggest that we should not be moving forward
&gt; agressively on connecting to the Internet; the benefits of this
&gt; initiative are clear and compelling.  However, it does require
&gt; that we undertake this effort with care and intelligence.
&gt; 
&gt; NIST's Computer Systems Security and Privacy Advisory Board
&gt; (CSSPAB) will be examining this very issue at their quarterly
&gt; meeting on March 23rd and 24th.  They will be examining the
&gt; several agencies' plans for putting agency mission critical
&gt; systems on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; F. Security Incident Response Efforts
&gt; 
&gt; The Need - Regardless of the security technology and other
&gt; measures we put in place on the Internet -- or any other network
&gt; -- we will always have security incidents.  We will discover
&gt; exploitable vulnerabilities.  We will suffer intrusions, attacks,
&gt; thefts, fraud, network failures, errors and omissions, and
&gt; uncountable other possible risks.  Since we will never be able to
&gt; anticipate, much less prevent all of these problems, we must have
&gt; in place effective mechanisms for dealing with them when they do
&gt; occur.  This is the role of security incident response efforts. 
&gt; The recent Internet incident reinforces the need for such
&gt; activities and demonstrates their value and effectiveness.
&gt; 
&gt; FIRST - Beginning with the aftermath of the 1988 Internet worm
&gt; incident, it was recognized that better methods for incident
&gt; response and information sharing were needed.  It was also clear
&gt; that the establishment of a single team or "hot line" would not
&gt; work; it would simply be overwhelmed.  Out of this was born the
&gt; concept of a coalition of response teams -- each serving its own
&gt; constituency, but working with the others to share information,
&gt; provide alerts, and provide mutual support in the response to
&gt; incidents and potential incidents.  That concept was embodied in
&gt; FIRST, the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams.  FIRST
&gt; has grown from an initial group of eleven, mostly Government,
&gt; teams to over thirty teams now.  These teams include Government,
&gt; industry, computer manufacturers, and academia -- both U.S. and
&gt; international.
&gt; 
&gt; Sharing Sensitive Security Incident Information - In discussing
&gt; these well-publicized problems, I think it is important to stress
&gt; that we at NIST believe that it is not a good idea to just
&gt; publicly announce system security weaknesses, in the hope that
&gt; such publicity will result in immediate solutions.  Some, indeed
&gt; most, security weaknesses cannot be fixed overnight -- for
&gt; example, it takes time to correct errors in operating systems,
&gt; test the new code, distribute the updated code, and install the
&gt; code.  Inappropriate publicity about some kinds of weaknesses
&gt; will merely serve as a call for their exploitation by malicious
&gt; hackers.
&gt; 
&gt; The FIRST concept addresses this problem by establishing a means
&gt; for developing a level of trust and cooperation among teams that
&gt; permits sharing of information.  The FIRST "membership" process
&gt; involves endorsement from an existing member, thus providing an
&gt; initial level of confidence.  Further interactions among teams
&gt; have build a level of trust and cooperation that probably could
&gt; never have existed otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; We believe we have demonstrated the success of this concept over
&gt; the last few years of FIRST's existence.  Groups who would have
&gt; never discussed security problems outside their own confines have
&gt; been able to work together with the confidence that they can gain
&gt; from the knowledge and experience of other groups without
&gt; exposing their organizations to attack in the process.
&gt; 
&gt; NIST's Role in FIRST - NIST has played a leadership role in FIRST
&gt; from the beginning.  NIST led efforts to bring together existing
&gt; teams, develop an operational framework, and get the activity
&gt; underway.  NIST continues to serve as the secretariat of FIRST. 
&gt; In that role, we provide coordination and technical support.  For
&gt; example, we established and administer the electronic mail
&gt; alerting network used by FIRST members.  We are currently
&gt; developing plans for a much more aggressive expansion of FIRST
&gt; membership throughout the Government.  To date, the most active
&gt; FIRST members in the Government have been teams from the
&gt; "traditional" Internet communities -- the DoD and research
&gt; agencies.  We are anxious to see more active participation on the
&gt; part of the rest of the civilian agencies of Government as they
&gt; increasingly become "network players".
&gt; 
&gt; Individual Response Teams - The role of the individual response
&gt; team cannot be ignored.  These teams are the essence of FIRST. 
&gt; They must establish procedures for managing incidents within
&gt; their defined constituencies, and they must be able to
&gt; communicate with the other FIRST teams.  The major hurdle we have
&gt; seen for agencies to become active in incident reponse activities
&gt; (aside from the lack of Internet connectivity in many cases) is
&gt; the need to develop an incident response "mindset" to complement
&gt; the traditional policy and procedures approach of many computer
&gt; security programs.  To help address this problem, we published in
&gt; 1991 a guidance document, NIST Special Publication 800-3,
&gt; Establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Capability. 
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, we believe that organized, coordinated, and effective
&gt; security incident response efforts throughout government (and
&gt; beyond) are critical to the security of the Internet (and the
&gt; NII) now and in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; G. Security Technology
&gt; 
&gt; Security technology is important for the effective enforcement of
&gt; security policies in any computer system.  Such technology is
&gt; especially important in a highly distributed, networked
&gt; environment -- such as the Internet -- in which physical and
&gt; administrative controls are limited.
&gt; 
&gt; Security Services - Five major security services are identified
&gt; in International Standard 7498-2.  This standard was developed to
&gt; specify the security aspects of the Open System Interconnect
&gt; (OSI) model of computer networks.  The security services (and a
&gt; short explanation of each) include:
&gt; 
&gt;       Authentication - Verification of the claimed identity of a
&gt;      computer or computer network user;
&gt; 
&gt;       Access Control - Verification and enforcement of the
&gt;      authorized uses of a computer network by a user subsequent
&gt;      to authentication;
&gt; 
&gt;       Data Integrity - Verification that the contents of a data
&gt;      item (e.g., message, file, program) have not been
&gt;      accidentally or intentionally changed in an unauthorized
&gt;      manner;
&gt; 
&gt;       Data Confidentiality - Protection of the information
&gt;      content of data from unauthorized disclosure;
&gt; 
&gt;       Non-repudiation - Protection against denial of sending (or
&gt;      receiving) a data item by the sender (or receiver).
&gt; 
&gt; These major security services should be augmented by a number of
&gt; auxiliary services (audit, availability assurance) and support
&gt; services (key management, security maintenance, network
&gt; management).  An integrated security system must offer all these
&gt; services with a number of security mechanisms implemented in a
&gt; number of security products.  Technology will advance and provide
&gt; for newer, cheaper, better products but the overall security
&gt; system need not be changed drastically if it is designed
&gt; properly.  NIST is working with several organizations seeking an
&gt; overall security architecture for unclassified information.  An
&gt; integrated security system can then be designed with
&gt; interchangeable and interoperable parts as needed.
&gt; 
&gt; Advanced Authentication - Since reusable passwords are the
&gt; weakest security link in the present Internet, better, more
&gt; advanced, authentication techniques are needed.  A spectrum of
&gt; solutions exist ranging from "one-time" passwords to high tech,
&gt; biometric identification systems.  Token based authentication and
&gt; access control systems appear to be a reasonable compromise among
&gt; the goals of low cost, high security and system simplicity.  NIST
&gt; has developed several token based security systems and continues
&gt; to evaluate several new alternatives.  Most are based on
&gt; something a user carries with them, like a "smart card" or "smart
&gt; token" or "smart disk."  Software modules unique to an individual
&gt; will also suffice if good software protection is provided to the
&gt; information in the module.
&gt; 
&gt; Public Key Infrastructure - A public key infrastructure (PKI) is
&gt; a part of an integrated security system that is needed to support
&gt; certain user authentication, data integrity and data
&gt; confidentiality services.  A PKI is a distributed system
&gt; consisting of people and computers that will verify the correct
&gt; identity of a person seeking authorization to use a computer
&gt; system or network and then associate a public key with that user
&gt; in a highly secure manner.  The certificate issuer in the PKI
&gt; produces an electronic certificate which contains the identity of
&gt; a user, the user's public key, some auxiliary information for the
&gt; security system and the digital signature of the CERTIFICATE
&gt; ISSUER.  The PKI should be established so that a secure "chain of
&gt; certificates" is established between any pair of users anywhere,
&gt; perhaps, in the world.  This allows someone to sign a secure
&gt; message, funds transfer or electronic contract and then allows
&gt; anyone else to verify the source and authenticity of the message,
&gt; etc.  NIST, along with several other organizations, are seeking
&gt; to design, implement and coordinate the requisite security
&gt; services of the PKI.
&gt; 
&gt; Obstacles to Deployment and Use of Security Technology in the
&gt; Internet - There are several current impediments to widespread
&gt; adoption and use of advanced computer security technologies
&gt; within the Internet.  However, these should be viewed as
&gt; obstacles, not barriers.
&gt; 
&gt;       Historic Community Culture - The Internet community has
&gt;      historically emphasized openess in communications.  Computer
&gt;      security has been viewed as interfering with this goal.
&gt; 
&gt;       Internet Management Organization - The Internet is a
&gt;      loosely coupled coalition of organizations and activities
&gt;      without a central management structure.  Minimal  rules must
&gt;      be followed in order to connect to the Internet backbone
&gt;      communication system, and certain protocols must be followed
&gt;      in order to communicate with others on the network.  There
&gt;      are few policies or practices which specify acceptable use
&gt;      or adequate security (even though policies for both of these
&gt;      have been developed).  The National Performance Review (NPR)
&gt;      has identified a need for such policies.
&gt; 
&gt;       Availability of Security Systems - While there are many
&gt;      individual security products (seeking a small number of
&gt;      narrow niche markets), there is still a lack of integrated
&gt;      security systems.  An example of such an integrated security
&gt;      system would be a commercially supported electronic mail
&gt;      security mechanism (integrating a comprehensive key
&gt;      management support system, user authentication and
&gt;      authorization support services, and user message security
&gt;      services).
&gt; 
&gt;       Interoperability - The commercial security products that
&gt;      solve similar security problems usually are not
&gt;      interoperable.  A given product may have a large number of
&gt;      features and interfaces, but will not interoperate with
&gt;      those of other products.  Thus, communities of interest may
&gt;      adopt and use one product, but those users must obtain a
&gt;      second product in order to communicate with someone in
&gt;      another community of interest.  Lack of interoperable
&gt;      products often delay a user from selecting and using any
&gt;      security until either a de facto or de jure standard
&gt;      emerges.
&gt; 
&gt;       Costs - Since there is yet no universal market for
&gt;      security products fitting into a seamless security system,
&gt;      the costs of individual security products built to fill
&gt;      niche markets are currently high.  However, costs will go
&gt;      down as volume and competition increase.
&gt; IV. ORGANIZATIONS, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES
&gt; 
&gt; There are several organizations in the Government and in the
&gt; private sector that have roles in the security of the Internet. 
&gt; It would be difficult to identify them all here.  Therefore, I
&gt; will describe briefly NIST's activities and our involvement in
&gt; other Internet-related organizations or activities.
&gt; 
&gt; NIST computer security activities have both direct and indirect
&gt; relevance to  security on the Internet.  In general, our programs
&gt; address information technology security in all environments. 
&gt; Howerver, since the Internet is such an important element in our
&gt; work and of an increasing number of Government agencies, we have
&gt; a number of activities directed specifically at the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; A. NIST's Computer Security Activities
&gt; 
&gt; Overall Program - In carrying out its mission, NIST seeks to
&gt; develop cost-effective security standards and guidelines for
&gt; federal systems.  These are often voluntarily adopted by those
&gt; outside the federal community.  We are working in many areas to
&gt; develop both the technology and standards and technology that
&gt; will be needed in the long term, and addressing short term
&gt; requirements for better training and awareness.  We have issued
&gt; guidelines or standards on many facets of computer security,
&gt; including: computer security awareness training, cryptographic
&gt; standards, password generation, smart card technology, security
&gt; of electronic commerce, viruses and other malicious code, risk
&gt; management, and PBX security.  We have also issued bulletins on
&gt; many computer security issues, which may be of interest to
&gt; federal agencies and private sector organizations, including a
&gt; July 1993 bulletin on security considerations in connecting to
&gt; the Internet.  NIST works directly with federal computer security
&gt; program managers through our Federal Computer Security Program
&gt; Managers' Forum.  We also participate on many voluntary standards
&gt; activities, and participate in various interagency forums.
&gt; 
&gt; While NIST has published guidance in a wide variety of areas,
&gt; including Internet-specific topics, NIST's computer security
&gt; program is not focused primarily on the Internet -- or any other
&gt; specific network or technology.  Operational responsibility for
&gt; the Internet, and thus specific, operational responsibility for
&gt; security, rests outside NIST.  Nevertheless, the Internet is
&gt; central to much of the information technology activities and
&gt; plans of Government agencies, and NIST has a responsibility to
&gt; address those needs.
&gt; 
&gt; General Activities Affecting the Internet - Some of the general
&gt; research, standards, and guidance activities of NIST that affect
&gt; the Internet include the following:
&gt; 
&gt;       Smartcard technology development and application
&gt;       Advanced authentication technology development and
&gt; application
&gt;       Trusted systems criteria and evaluation
&gt;       Cryptographic methods, interfaces, and applications 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Specific Activities Affecting the Internet - In addition, NIST
&gt; has undertaken a number of activities that focuse directly on
&gt; Internet security issues.  These include the following:
&gt; 
&gt;       CSL Bulletins - guidance on connecting to the Internet
&gt;       Special Publications - guidance  on Incident Response
&gt; Capability
&gt;       FIRST leadership and support 
&gt; 
&gt; Firewalls Research - One of the most actively examined methods of
&gt; protecting systems or subnetworks connected to the Internet is
&gt; the use of "firewalls" -- specially-programmed machines to
&gt; control the interface between a subnetwork and the Internet. 
&gt; NIST has established, with the assistance of the National
&gt; Communications System and others, a new Firewalls Research
&gt; Laboratory effort to extend and share knowledge in this important
&gt; area.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to these programmatic activities, NIST is involved in
&gt; a number of groups and activities that are directly involved in
&gt; Internet security.
&gt; 
&gt; B. Information Infrastructure Task Force
&gt; 
&gt; Security is being addressed on several fronts in the Information
&gt; Infrastructure Task Force (IITF).  There are specific security
&gt; efforts in each of the three main committees of the IITF, plus
&gt; the Privacy Working Group of the Information Policy Committee. 
&gt; NIST is involved all of these efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; C. OMB Circular A-130
&gt; 
&gt; NIST is working with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in
&gt; the revision of Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130.  This
&gt; appendix specifically addresses agency information technology
&gt; security programs.  Although this does not address the Internet
&gt; specifically, we expect the new appendix to include the
&gt; requirement for agency incident response capabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; D. Federal Networking Council
&gt; 
&gt; The Federal Networking Council (FNC) is an interagency group
&gt; which coordinates the computer networking activities of federal
&gt; agencies that serve general and specific research communities. 
&gt; The FNC established a security working group to address various
&gt; security needs and seek common security services and mechanisms
&gt; meeting these needs.  The security working group, under the
&gt; leadership of NIST, has initiated the following activities:
&gt; 
&gt; Security Policy for Use of the National Research and Education
&gt; Network - a high level security policy which specifies the
&gt; principles and goals of security in the NREN and then assigns
&gt; responsibilities to six categories of participants in the NREN
&gt; (completed and approved by the FNC).
&gt; 
&gt; Security Architecture for the NREN - a comprehensive but generic
&gt; categorization of the components of security needed to satisfy
&gt; the security requirements of the NREN.  This activity has been
&gt; initiated but not completed.
&gt; 
&gt; Security Action Plan for the NREN - a first draft of an action
&gt; plan for developing and fielding security prototype components
&gt; (e.g., smartcards, access control tokens) has been developed; 
&gt; participants in the user acceptance testing are being solicited.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; E. Internet Society Security Activities
&gt; 
&gt; The sponsors and supporters of the Internet have conducted
&gt; several security activities over the past several years.  The
&gt; CERT and FIRST activities, previously described, were major
&gt; activities to alert users of potential and on-going security
&gt; problems and to provide information on what to do about them. 
&gt; The following are other activities and the roles that NIST has
&gt; played in each of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Internet Security Policy - The Internet Engineering Task Force
&gt; (IETF) sponsored the development of a policy for secure operation
&gt; of the Internet.  This policy specified six basic guidelines for
&gt; security:
&gt; 
&gt;       assure individual accountability;
&gt;       employ available security mechanisms;
&gt;       maintain security of host computers;
&gt;       provide computers that embody security controls;
&gt;       cooperate in providing security; and
&gt;       seek technical improvements.  
&gt; 
&gt; These guidelines were expanded and clarified in the Security
&gt; Policy for Use of the National Research and Education Network. 
&gt; NIST participated in the development of the Internet security
&gt; policy and was a major player in development of the NREN security
&gt; policy.
&gt; 
&gt; Privacy Enhanced Mail - The IETF sponsored the development of the
&gt; Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) system.  PEM provides the ability to
&gt; protect the integrity and confidentiality (i.e., privacy) of
&gt; electronic messages on a user-selected basis.  PEM utilizes the
&gt; popular Simple Mail Transfer Protocol as the foundation for
&gt; private (sometimes also called, trusted or secure) mail.  PEM
&gt; uses the Federal Data Encryption Standard for confidentiality
&gt; protection.  Digital signatures are used to assure the integrity
&gt; of a message and to verify the source (originator) of the
&gt; message.  NIST was a participant in the group that developed the
&gt; specifications for PEM.  It is available both as a free,
&gt; unsupported software package and a licensed supported software
&gt; system.V. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, then, I think that recent Internet security
&gt; experiences have taught us -- or have reinforced -- some
&gt; important lessons, and there are some obvious actions that should
&gt; follow.
&gt; 
&gt; A. Lessons and Conclusions
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet Is a Lightning Rod - The public already knows about
&gt; the Internet and understands that the Internet will be a part of
&gt; the national information infrastructure.  Thus, any security
&gt; problems affecting the Internet reflect on the entire NII effort
&gt; and could undermine the public's confidence in and willingness to
&gt; use that developing infrastructure. 
&gt; 
&gt; Internet Security is Not a "Second Tier" Issue - The attention
&gt; that security incidents receive in the media and the impact that
&gt; recent incidents have had on the operations of some agencies and
&gt; other Internet users make it clear that security is now a first
&gt; level concern that must be addressed.
&gt; 
&gt; Organized Incident Response Efforts Work - Despite the widespread
&gt; impact of recent incident, it is clear that organized,
&gt; cooperative incident response efforts -- which we in the Federal
&gt; Government had in-place -- were instrumental in identifying and
&gt; mitigating its effect.  This incident reinforces the importance
&gt; and need for such efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; Traditional, Re-Usable Passwords are Inadequate in a Network
&gt; Environment - The nature of data communications networks makes
&gt; unacceptable the continued reliance on traditional, re-usable
&gt; passwords for user authentication.
&gt; 
&gt; Secure Systems Operations Require Skilled Personnel - The highly
&gt; powerful and sophisticated workstations that are increasingly
&gt; being connected to the Internet are often operated by technically
&gt; unskilled users.  Further, most systems come "out of the box"
&gt; configured for the easiest-to-install-and-use options -- usually
&gt; also the most insecure configuration.  To be installed,
&gt; connected, and operated securely, these systems currently require
&gt; the users to be full-fledged system adminstrators, not just
&gt; "ordinary users".  This is an unreasonable and unrealistic
&gt; expectation.
&gt; 
&gt; B. Recommendations for Action
&gt; 
&gt; Implement the NII/NPR Action Items - The recommendations of the
&gt; National Performance Review in the area of information technology
&gt; security address specifically some of the needs for the Internet. 
&gt; NIST and the other action agencies will be working to implement
&gt; those recommendations. 
&gt; 
&gt; Deploy Advanced Authentication Technology - We must move forward
&gt; agressively to deploy already-available technology to replace the
&gt; traditional re-usable password as the method of choice for user
&gt; authentication.  Technologies developed at NIST and those
&gt; becoming available in the marketplace can make marked
&gt; improvements in the near term.  In the longer term, we must begin
&gt; establishment of sectoral and national certificate
&gt; infrastructures to enable more generally available and
&gt; interoperable methods of authentication.
&gt; 
&gt; Promote and Expand Incident Response Activities - The concept
&gt; works.  We must now move actively to ensure that agencies
&gt; throughout Government and constituencies nation-wide establish
&gt; active and cooperating incident response capabilities.  NIST
&gt; plans to continue to lead such efforts within the Government and
&gt; promote them world-wide through FIRST and similar activities.
&gt; 
&gt; Educate and Train System Administrators - In the long run, we
&gt; cannot demand that users of increasingly sophisticated technology
&gt; be technical experts, i.e., system administrators. We must find
&gt; ways to deliver secure systems "out of the box".  In the short
&gt; term, however, we must better train system users.  If agencies
&gt; are going to connect their networks (and thereby their agencies)
&gt; to the Internet and other external networks, their technical
&gt; personnel must understand the risks involved and be trained and
&gt; equipped to manage such connections securely.  NIST and others
&gt; have published technical guidance to assist in this process and
&gt; will be developing additional guidance in the future.  Agencies
&gt; must take it upon themselves, however, to ensure adequate
&gt; technical training of their personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; Use Available Security Technology - Computer users, system
&gt; administrators, and service providers should evaluate and, where
&gt; cost-effective, employ current security products and technologies
&gt; to reduce risks to acceptable levels.
&gt; 
&gt; C. Conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; There are always trade-offs involved in the use of new or complex
&gt; technology -- especially in something as potentially universal as
&gt; the Internet and the evolving national information
&gt; infrastructure.  The challenge, of course, is to find the right
&gt; balance of risks and costs against the benefits.  However, I must
&gt; emphasize that even with a complete restructuring and replacement
&gt; of the current Internet we would continue to have security
&gt; incidents and other problems.  Historically, with the
&gt; introduction of any new technology, the miscreants and charlatans
&gt; are not far behind.  Our task is to work as hard as we can to
&gt; anticipate and avoid such problems and, we hope, get and stay a
&gt; step or two ahead of the game.  I would also like to assure you
&gt; that NIST -- in concert with the several other key players in the
&gt; Internet -- is both aware of the importance of Internet security
&gt; in the context of the evolving national information
&gt; infrastructure and actively undertaking efforts to meet that
&gt; need.  
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you again for the opportunity to
&gt; speak to your committee.  We at NIST -- and the other communities
&gt; of interest involved in the Internet and the NII -- look forward
&gt; to working with your committee and others in the Congress on this
&gt;
