 &gt; Once upon a time, two strangers found a dog...
 &gt; 
 &gt; Likewise, when you were tested recently by net abuse, you went for
 &gt; relief to your master, the government.  

I find this analogy pretty thin...

 &gt; This is what distinguishes you from the rest of us. 

"Us"?

 &gt; We might react against the abuse (or we might not), but I think
 &gt; that none of us - or at least a very few - would have gone to court
 &gt; for relief. 

I appreciate your input, but please do not presume to speak for me.

 &gt; Despite your protestation, "I also don't like to be a bully", it seems
 &gt; to me that your pursuit of this case was predicated on your ability to
 &gt; be a bully and an insider.

An "insider", because he happens to know a judge?  Sorry, but
knowledge of the law is not some sort of exclusive privilege.

 &gt; Like your colleagues Cantor and Seigel

!!!

 &gt; You only had to find someone who was ill, and then kick him
 &gt; while he was down.

It has never been demonstrated to my satisfaction that tmp@netcom.com
is ill, and while the suggestion has been made frequently I don't
think we can use the supposition to accuse Mr. Unicorn of "kicking" a
sick person.  This is a serious twisting of the facts.

 &gt; Was it Rousseau who said, "First, we kill all the lawyers"?  

No; that's the most bizarre misattribution I've seen in a while...

 &gt; The cost of a lawsuit in the U.S. today can easily be over
 &gt; $100,000.

Indeed; it might be $10,000,000!!!  Or, of course, it might be
nothing, and it might be that someone victimized by a frivolous
lawsuit can sue to recover costs.

 &gt; The cost of a contract murder is said to be $10,000-$50,000.
 &gt; Consider the economics. 

I'm pretty quickly losing track of this train of thought.  Are you
suggesting that Mr. Unicorn should have consulted a mafioso instead of
a judge?

 &gt; I think there is a role to be played by lawyers in the future of the
 &gt; net. The net does not like litigation, because it interferes with the
 &gt; free flow of information.

This statement makes no sense.  Is it not obvious that litigation need
have nothing whatsoever to do with the free flow of information?
