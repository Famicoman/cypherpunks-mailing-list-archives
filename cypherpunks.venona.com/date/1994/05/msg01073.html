 &gt;  -=&gt; Quoting John Nieder &lt;=-

 &gt; Secondly, a lot of folks do not feel easy about posting to ANY
 &gt; gun-related list or group because of employer, social or other prejudice
 &gt; to which they may be subjected.  If a joe.victim@anti-gun.widget.com
 &gt; wants to use a simple remailer for putting a little shade on his
 &gt; participation, I don't feel it's anyone else's business; "caution is not
 &gt; cowardice and carelessness is not courage."  More importantly, it's
 &gt; nobody else's _problem_ as long as the content of the post is not
 &gt; objectionable.  

 Jo&gt; So censorship is allowable if the post is objectionable?

I didn't say that, nor mean it.  All I said was that there isn't a
_problem_ unless it's in the content, just as with any other message in
a newsgroup.  The fact that a remailer is used in itself doesn't create
a problem in its posting of an otherwise benign message.  See?

 Jo&gt; Wouldn't
 Jo&gt; that mean the moderator has to make more subjective judgements?

I don't know, but if he was killing messages, he'd at least have to have
a reason.  Someone's address isn't one.  The moderator in question here
(rec.guns) subjectively censors my messages because of content, if
that's your point.

 Jo&gt; How
 Jo&gt; long would it be before someone started yelling "outst the moderator"
 Jo&gt; due to   "subjective rejection criterea"?

Well, I for one already am.  Rejection of otherwise benign technical
posts for no other reason than having been gated through a remailer,
even non-anonymously with Reply-To: fields and sigs, is about as
subjective and arbitrary a rejection criterion as I can personally
imagine, especially in view of all the absolutely junk posts that do
pass muster.

 Jo&gt; I assume that some of this
 Jo&gt; is with reguards to rec.guns.

Most of it, yes, at the moment.

 Jo&gt; The moderator there does an excellent
 Jo&gt; job even if a little too much political stuff occasionally creeps in.

Particularly his irrational fear of remailered posts.  Pure politics.
