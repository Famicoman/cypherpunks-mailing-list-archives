-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

This is to announce an unofficial release of PGP, based on 2.3a,
modified for interoperability with MIT's PGP 2.6.

The files are on <A  HREF="ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/pgp/">ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/pgp/</A>

 2.6ui-readme           The file README.1st from the 2.6ui release.
 pgp26ui-src.tar.gz     UNIX source distribution, compressed with gzip.
 pgp26ui-src.tar.gz.sig Detached signature for pgp26ui-src.tar.gz.
 pgp26uis.zip           DOS source distribution, archived with Info-ZIP.
 pgp26uis.sig           Detached signature for pgp26uis.zip.
 pgp26uix.zip           DOS .EXE distribution, archived with Info-ZIP.
 pgp26uix.sig           Detached signature for pgp26uix.zip.
 pgp23a-26ui.patch.gz   Context diffs to go from 2.3a to 2.6ui, gzipped.

I tried to upload to ftp.funet.fi, src.doc.ic.ac.uk and ftp.dsi.unimi.it, 
but the net seems flaky today.

The following changes have been made from 2.3a:

 * Reads encoded data produced by both MIT PGP 2.6 and PGP 2.3a.

 * Writes data either in the "new" format used by MIT PGP 2.6, or in the 
   old PGP 2.3a format.  Option settable via a command line switch or 
   config.txt setting.  Default is old 'compatible' format.

 * No time-bomb code in it.  If you want to switch version byte like MIT 
   PGP does, you'll have to do it manually on September 1st.  There's no 
   advantage in doing so, unless you want it to look like you're running 
   MIT PGP.

 * You can choose the version text which you want to have appear in
   ASCII armoured files.  The default is 2.6, and if you're in the USA
   you probably don't want to change it, as a well known
   net.personality tends to harass people whose PGP armor says anything
   else.  Again, this can be changed via command line or via
   config.txt.

 * Displays and accepts 8 characters of the key ID.  Hence there's less 
   chance of two keys having the same visible ID.

 * Makefile entries have been added for sunos5cc and sunos5gcc, for
   people using SPARC workstations running Solaris 2.  I have personally
   tested the sunos5gcc build on Solaris 2.3, and it compiles cleanly.
   A line for NeXTstep Intel has also been added (next486).

 * The file idea68k.s has been removed, at the request of the author.
   It was obsolete.  Better 68k routines are available; for example,
   suitable routines for the Amiga are available on Aminet.

 * A message has been added to the key generation section, reminding
   the user that MIT PGP 2.6 will only handle keys of 504-1024 bits.
   This version has no key length crippling, however.

 * Memory allocated with _fcalloc and freed with _ffree in ztrees.c 
   and zdeflate.c, to avoid memory leakage in the MS-DOS version.

 * The -w option wipes files with pseudo-random data, to try and
   ensure the file is wiped even if you're using a disk compressor.
   Note that this still isn't perfect; DOS can randomly duplicate bits
   of cleartext files in partially-used clusters, and those fragments
   won't be removed if the original file is wiped.

 * Branko Lankester and Paul C Leyland's patches have been applied, so
   that newer key certification signatures automatically replace older
   ones.  This also fixes a bug in the display of new keys with
   multiple signatures.

This version was assembled by mathew &lt;mathew@mantis.co.uk&gt; from the
standard PGP 2.3a sources, and from source code patches obtained from
the net.  All patches were scrutinized carefully before being applied by
hand.  No binary patches were used.  The DOS executables were built by
mathew using Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.0 (MS C v8).

No RSAREF source code was used; in fact, I used no source code from MIT 
PGP at all.  I haven't even looked at the MIT sources.  (No, really.)
Thanks to those anonymous individuals who tested the program against
MIT 2.6...

Disclaimer:  This software is nothing to do with Mantis Consultants, and
is without warranty or guarantee of any kind.  Using it in the USA is
probably very naughty.

If you have any patches to fix bugs or add features, feel free to mail
them to me, and I'll consider adding them to any future unofficial release.
