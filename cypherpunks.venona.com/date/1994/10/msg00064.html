&gt;Subject: Judge Rejects Delay on FBI Wiretap Data

&gt;=============================================================

&gt;PRESS RELEASE

&gt;For immediate release
&gt;October 3, 1994

&gt;Contact:
&gt;   Marc Rotenberg, EPIC Director
&gt;   David Sobel, EPIC Legal Counsel
&gt;   202 544 9240 (tel)


&gt;            JUDGE REJECTS DELAY ON FBI WIRETAP DATA;

&gt;                 "STUNNED" BY BUREAU'S REQUEST

&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C.- A federal judge today denied the FBI's request 
&gt;for a five-year delay in processing documents concerning wiretap 
&gt;legislation now pending in Congress.  

&gt;     Saying he was "stunned" by the Bureau's attempt to postpone 
&gt;court proceedings for five years, U.S. District Judge Charles R. 
&gt;Richey ordered the FBI to release the material or to explain its 
&gt;reasons for withholding it by November 4.

&gt;     The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public 
&gt;interest research group based in Washington, DC, filed the Freedom 
&gt;of Information Act lawsuit on August 9, the day legislation was 
&gt;introduced in Congress to authorize the expenditure of $500 
&gt;million to make the nation's communications systems easier to 
&gt;wiretap.  The group is seeking the public release of two surveys 
&gt;cited by FBI Director Louis Freeh in support of the pending 
&gt;legislation. 

&gt;     The FBI had moved to stay proceedings in the case until June 
&gt;1999, more than five years after the filing of the initial 
&gt;request.  The Bureau asserted it was confronted with "a backlog of 
&gt;pending FOIA requests awaiting processing."  The FBI revealed that 
&gt;there are "an estimated 20 pages to be reviewed" but said that the 
&gt;materials would not be reviewed until "sometime in March 1999."

&gt;     Judge Richey rejected the FBI's claims in sharp language from 
&gt;the bench.  He told the government's attorney to "call Director 
&gt;Freeh and tell him I said this matter can be taken care of in an 
&gt;hour and a half."

&gt;     In court papers filed late last week, EPIC charged that 
&gt;the requested materials are far too important to be kept secret. 
&gt;"The requested surveys were part of the FBI's long-standing 
&gt;campaign to gain passage of unprecedented legislation requiring 
&gt;the nation's telecommunications carriers to redesign their 
&gt;telephone networks to more easily facilitate court-ordered 
&gt;wiretapping," said the EPIC brief.

&gt;     Earlier documents obtained through the FOIA in similar 
&gt;litigation with the FBI revealed no technical obstacles to the 
&gt;exercise of court-authorized wire surveillance.

&gt;     The FBI is pushing for quick enactment of the wiretap 
&gt;legislation in the closing days of the 103rd Congress.  A 
&gt;grassroots campaign to oppose the measure is being coordinated by 
&gt;EPIC and Voters Telecomm Watch.

&gt;     The Electronic Privacy Information Center is a project of 
&gt;Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a membership 
&gt;organization based in Palo Alto, California, and the Fund for 
&gt;Constitutional Government, a Washington-based foundation dedicated 
&gt;to the protection of Constitutional freedoms. 202 544 9240 (tel),
