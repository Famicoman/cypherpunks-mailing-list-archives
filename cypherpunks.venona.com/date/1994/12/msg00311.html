&gt; Could someone bring me up to speed on this group?  On the surface, it 
&gt; would seem that there is a lot in common with their objectives and the
&gt; general Cypherpunks "philosophy". (quotes because I understand the 
&gt; diversity of thought in this group.)

&gt; To: L D Weller 71011,1743
&gt;  
&gt; It  turned out to all be a scam, actually.  The key people involved, Eric
&gt; Kline and Chuck Geshlieder, allegedly had a scheme set up where they
&gt; repeatedly paid themselves out of all of the proceeds.  It apparently went
&gt; something like this:
&gt;  
&gt; 1)  Donations came to Oceania.  Kline and Geshlider, as principals, got
&gt; paid a portion.
&gt;  
&gt; 2)  Oceania then contracted with The Gold Standard Press, owned by Kline
&gt; and Geshlider, to do printing.  Kline got a share as the sales rep.
&gt;  
&gt; 3)  Gold Standard Press then printed fund-raising letters for Oceania.
&gt; Kline and Geshlider split the profits, as partners in Gold Standard.
&gt;  
&gt; 4)  Oceania sent out more fund-raising requests.
&gt;  
&gt; 5)  Donations came to Oceania.  (see #1)
&gt;  
&gt; It fell apart when Kline and Geshlider allegedly accused each other of
&gt; fraud, and Geshlider apparently took his case to the Nevada State Attorney
&gt; General's Consumer Fradu Division.  (Poor Chuck, there were no consumer's
&gt; in this transaction.)  What is amazing about all of this is that The Gold
&gt; Standard was an ILLEGAL business (no business license) and Chuck had been
&gt; hauled before a judge a few months ago on this very charge.  He allegedly
&gt; threatened to beat her up in the parking lot (something he has threatened
&gt; to virtually everyone who has ever met him), and then skipped town for a
&gt; couple of weeks.  The people at the Attorney General's office apparently
&gt; were astounded that Chuck, who is knowlingly running an illegal business,
&gt; and is not keeping any records the IRS might get hold of, is complaining
&gt; about his business partner and co-conspirator about a scam.  After all,
&gt; there are NO Gold Standard Press records, and there are NO Oceania
&gt; records.  (It turns out that Kline was simply writing checks Pay To The
&gt; Order of Cash, and then using the cash to cover his reversals in the Stock
&gt; Market.)
&gt;  
&gt; Eventually, their need for cash apparently outstripped the rate at which
&gt; suckers were sending them money, and like hungry wolves, set upon each
&gt; other.
&gt;  
&gt; GOOD RIDDANCE!
&gt;  
&gt; p.s. I know both of these jerks personally. We have tried to throw them
&gt; out of the LP in Las Vegas for several years.  Like counterfeit money,
&gt; they just keep turning up!
