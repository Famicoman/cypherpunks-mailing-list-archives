&gt;"Actual" terminals is not the issue, but "virtual" terminals *is*. I
&gt;haven't done a poll lately, or ever in fact, but my hunch is that 70%
&gt;of the list is emulating some form of terminal, e.g., a VT-100 or 102,
&gt;or maybe something slightly more exotic. Or a shell program, as in
&gt;America Online, which has its own standard.

If they are using terminal emulation they have only themselves to blame.

&gt;-- Netcom doesn't give me a convenient way to bypass the dial-up
&gt;terminal emulators (PPP and SLIP are no longer offered by Netcom)

&gt;-- Local Internet providers (ScruzNet, SenseMedia) are not, last I
&gt;checked, offering e-mail. (Harry Bartholomew, of our list, has been
&gt;looking into this and he tells me the best current strategy is to have
&gt;two accounts: a SLIP or PPP provider for the Web, and ftp, etc., and a
&gt;standard Netcom account for mail. I expect this to change, which is
&gt;the thrust of my comments about the Web, but this is how things now
&gt;change.)

&gt;-- The communication issue. What are _others_ using? I could certainly
&gt;use my _graphics_ capabilities in the ways that Amanda and Perry are
&gt;suggesting, and which I do all the time of course, but messages would
&gt;still best be generated with an ASCII terminal environment as the
&gt;intended destination. I note that all of Perry's messages, and most of
&gt;Amanda's messages, fit this ASCII model.

I can't help but wondering how big of a part you play in this.

&gt;(The MIME stuff I'm not saying shouldn't be used, just that some of
&gt;us--perhaps most of us, is my hunch--will not be adopting the latest
&gt;bleeding edge technology. The comments here about Sun and Microsoft
&gt;not properly--or at all--supporting MIME tell us that it's not real
&gt;likely that most folks here will be sending spreadsheets out to the
&gt;list readers and attaching GIFs anytime soon. No great loss, either.)

Not to the list, but to others -- over email.

&gt;Finally, Amanda mentioned "being away from out desks." Well, many of
&gt;us are _always_ away from our desks when we post. From home machines,
&gt;not from T3-connected Indigos on our desk.

DUO 230. Can't go to 14.4, because I am "too far from the switch." PacBell
won't do anything about it. "All we guarantee is audible voice
communication."

ObPlug:
Today we received the first two engineering samples of our new
lan/phone/video devices that give you 16Mbps using the very same 4 phone
wires that are already in your wall. At less than $100 per node. Call your
congressman today and demand local telco deregulation :-)

&gt;And we're usually our own "mail support" staff: we have no one to turn
&gt;to help us set up the latest-and-greatest (especially for a very
&gt;minimal ROI).

I volunteer.


&gt;I am content to mainly communicate with most of you in the form of
&gt;these ASCII messages. I've done a _lot_ of desktop publishing in my
&gt;day, mostly for internal reports and conference papers, and I can't
&gt;really say that the fancy fonts, graphs, multicolumn displays, etc,
&gt;would have much effect on my ability to get my points across.

Agreed.

&gt;One thing I would like very much is the ability to include simple
&gt;diagrams and drawings in my posts, but this is clearly an _unsolved_
&gt;problem, from a practical point of view. (Before any of you scream to
&gt;me about how this can be done, ask yourself how many people could
&gt;plausibly _see_ the results, given the realities of the Net today, and
&gt;ask yourself where all these posts-with-diagrams are if they're so
&gt;easy to do.)

Uhm, most people?
