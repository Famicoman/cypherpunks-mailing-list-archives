I've received a couple of requests for information about the RSAREF-Perl
interface. Yes, I do intend to release it, and it follows the RSAREF
interface so there is no patent problem involved. It calls the DES library
directly, but RSA says they have no problem with that. I'm currently waiting
to hear if it is okay to call the random-number generator, so I can provide
a "get random bytes" function. When I find this out, and integrate the
"shade" program mentioned below, I will release it officially. I can send
out Beta versions now to people who really want to test it, and will give me
feedback on how it works. You need a Unix machine (no root required), a copy
of RSAREF 2.0, a copy of Perl 4, and a classic or gcc compiler.

Deleted? That was my main point! What do you think of this remailer design?

&gt;&gt;For something complex like this, we need a language with a little more
&gt;&gt;leverage than C provides. For this and other complex protocols, I've ported
&gt;&gt;RSAREF 2.0 to Perl. The interface does not require you to recompile Perl.
&gt;&gt;It uses a C daemon and pipes. It provides symmetric encryption, public-key
&gt;&gt;encryption, digital signatures, hashing, DH exchange, and ASCII armor.
&gt;&gt;The algorithms used are MD5, MD2, DES, DESX, triple-DES, RSA, and DH.
&gt;&gt;It has a good (eval/die) exception handling mechanism, and a very thorough
&gt;&gt;regression testing script.
&gt;&gt;[...]
&gt;&gt;I want to add other algorithms to the Perl encryption package. The secret
&gt;&gt;sharing, for one. A one-function call to gzip for compression. A blind
&gt;&gt;signature if I could get patent permission (not from Chaum; how's Brands?)
&gt;&gt;or perhaps just do it with a "research purposes only" disclaimer. Someone
&gt;&gt;with Visual Basic experience could do a DOS/Windows VBX module to enable
&gt;&gt;easy writing of PC clients for neat net-based servers written with the Perl
&gt;&gt;encryption package.

&gt;This is very exciting!  Could you show some examples of how your code
&gt;would be used with Perl?  Some kind of script that could work with MP
&gt;numbers or RSA decrypt a file?  It would be very good to have a
&gt;prototyping language like Perl with crypto addons.

I put some examples from the manual at the end of this message, as they are
fairly long compared to the rest of the message. Essentially it does
everything documented in "rsaref.txt".

&gt;&gt;Code for secret sharing is available, but most secret-sharing algorithms
&gt;&gt;create shadows each the size of the message. This can be avoided: use an
&gt;&gt;error correcting code to add enough information to the original so the
&gt;&gt;message can be recreated with any m of n pieces. Break into pieces, encrypt
&gt;&gt;each piece, and secret-share the key. Where can I get an error correction
&gt;&gt;algorithm that can do this? You should be able to increase a file's size by
&gt;&gt;50% and then have any two of three pieces recreate it, for example.

&gt;Try looking for a package called Shade using Archie.  Here is an excerpt
&gt;from the doc file:

&gt;&gt;`shade' is a file splitting and merging utility.  It takes a large
&gt;&gt;file and splits it into uniformly sized blocks.  It can also output
&gt;&gt;extra blocks (called shadows).  These shadows can be used to recover
&gt;&gt;missing sections if they get corrupted or it they are lost.  With a
&gt;&gt;single shadow, `shade' can recover ANY single missing block.  As many
&gt;&gt;shadows are needed as there are blocks missing.  If too few blocks
&gt;&gt;and shadows are available, nothing can be recovered.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;For example, foo.bar (259042 bytes) is split into 5 sections
&gt;&gt;of 45000 bytes, 1 section of 34042 bytes and 2 shadows of
&gt;&gt;45000 bytes.  Each of these 8 parts is sent through email.
&gt;&gt;Even if any two of these eight parts gets lost, the original
&gt;&gt;foo.bar can be reconstructed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;`shade' is a simple application of the chinese remainder theorem
&gt;&gt;for polynomials with coeficients modulo two.  For more information
&gt;&gt;see the comments at the beginning of project.c.

Ok, I will get this file. Looks like what I wanted.

&gt;As for the remailer return address idea, I would suggest looking at
&gt;Chaum's 1981 paper from CACM which has a similar concept.  I believe it
&gt;was posted here recently.  Instead of using shared secrets he had the
&gt;secret key at each hop get embedded in the return address itself.

My database system (grep) picked up the article, posted Oct 14 anonymously.
Looks like Chaum just has the remailer keep track of sent messages and
refuse to process them again. This does not protect you if the remailer is
coerced or hacked. There is still enough persistent information available to
catch you. Is there a good way to establish a shared secret untraceably?

----

Applying a chainsaw to the RSAREF for Perl user manual:

You have two files: rsaref.pl and rsarefd. Rsarefd is a C program, and
rsaref.pl is a perl package you "require" to use it.
...
The functions available are:

Message digest (secure hashing) algorithms MD5 and MD2
Symmetric encryption algorithms DES, DESX, and Triple-DES in CBC mode
ASCII encoding and decoding of binary strings according to RFC 1421
Public-key encryption with RSA and DES, DESX, or Triple-DES in CBC mode
Digital signatures with RSA and MD5 or MD2
Generation of RSA keys (up to 1024 bits) for the above
Diffie-Hellman key agreement (up to 1024 bits)
Generation of Diffie-Hellman parameters for the above
...
The included Perl script "rsaref_test" will test all of the interface
functions, and generate all of the exceptions to make sure they are handled
correctly. It also checks the daemon for memory leaks. If rsarefd has been
compiled in the current directory and rsaref.pl is available, running
"rsaref_test" should run it.
...
Exception handling is done with the Perl eval/die mechanism. The individual
error codes are listed along with the function descriptions. The error code
will be returned in $@ as an ASCII string if the eval fails.
...
require 'rsaref.pl';
&amp;rsaref'start_daemon($daemon_location); # starts rsarefd
&amp;rsaref'end_daemon; # ends rsarefd

$digest=&amp;rsaref'digest($data,$digestAlgorithm); # take a message digest
  $digestAlgorithm is one of the defined constants
  "$rsaref'DA_MD2" or "$rsaref'DA_MD5".
An "RE_DIGEST_ALGORITHM" will be raised if $digestAlgorithm is invalid.

$output=&amp;rsaref'cipher($input,$key,$iv,$function,$algorithm);
Encrypts or decrypts a string using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
$function is one of "$rsaref'CM_ENCRYPT" or "$rsaref'CM_DECRYPT".

$algorithm is one of $rsaref'EA_DES_CBC, $rsaref'EA_DESX_CBC,
$rsaref'EA_DES_EDE3_CBC or $rsaref'EA_DES_EDE2_CBC.

If $algorithm or $function is invalid, the function raises an
"RE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM" exception. If $key is larger than 24 bytes or $iv
is not 8 bytes long, the function raises a "RE_KEY" exception.

$asciiText=&amp;rsaref'encodePEMblock($binaryData);
$binaryData=&amp;rsaref'decodePEMblock($asciiText);

These two functions are used to move binary data, such as ciphertext and
keys, via Email and other non-eight-bit-clean channels. They are similar to
(but not compatible with) uuencode. The method is detailed in RFC 1421.
encodePEMblock does not raise any exceptions. decodePEMblock will raise an
"RE_ENCODING" if the input is invalid.

$bytes=&amp;rsaref'getRandomBytesNeeded;
&amp;rsaref'randomUpdate($randomBytes); # setup random numbers

@private_key=&amp;rsaref'generatePEMkeys($bits,$useFermat4);
@public_key=@private_key[0..2];

This function is used to generate RSA public and private keys for digital
signatures and public-key encryption ("envelopes" or "sealing".)

$bits specifies the key length from 508 to 1024 bits.
$useFermat4 chooses the public exponent; if it is 0, the exponent is 3; if
it is 1, the exponent is 65537.
The returned @private_key is actually:
 ($bits,$modulus,$publicExponent,$privateExponent,$prime1,$prime2,
  $primeExponent1,$primeExponent2,$coefficient)
By taking only the first three, you get a public key:
 ($bits,$modulus,$publicExponent)

This function raises an "RE_NEED_RANDOM" if you did not initialize the
random-number generator. If your key length is out of range, it raises
an "RE_MODULUS_LEN" exception.

$signature=&amp;rsaref'sign($data,$digestAlgorithm,@privateKey);
This function raises an "RE_DIGEST_ALGORITHM" exception if $digestAlgorithm
is invalid, or an "RE_PRIVATE_KEY" if @private_key is invalid.

&amp;rsaref'verify($data,$digestAlgorithm,$signature,@publicKey); Verify returns
no value. If it completes successfully, the signature is valid. If the
signature is invalid, Verify raises an "RE_SIGNATURE" exception.
Verify returns an "RE_LEN" if the signature is the wrong length, and an
"RE_PUBLIC_KEY" if the public key cannot decrypt the signature. This means
the public key or the signature is corrupted.

($encryptedMessage,$iv,@encryptedKeys)=
    &amp;rsaref'seal($message,$encryptionAlgorithm,@publicKeys);

This function seals (public-key encrypts) a message. The same message can be
encrypted for multiple recipients. The message is only encrypted once; then
the session key is encrypted with each recipient's public key.

@publicKeys are one or more public keys. For each public key you provide,
you will get back one encryptedKey. Each encryptedKey can decrypt the
message using the private key corresponding to the public key used to
encrypt it.

Seal raises an "RE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM" exception if $encryptionAlgorithm
is invalid, an "RE_PUBLIC_KEY" if the public key is invalid, and an
"RE_NEED_RANDOM" if the random-number generator is not initialized.

$message=&amp;rsaref'open($encryptedMessage,$iv,$encryptionAlgorithm,
                      $encryptedKey,@privateKey);

This function opens (decrypts) a sealed message using a private key.
$encryptedMessage is the output from the seal operation.

Open raises an RE_LEN exception if the encryptedKey size is out of range,
RE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM if the encryptionAlgorithm is invalid,
RE_PRIVATE_KEY if the private key cannot decrypt the encryptedKey, and
RE_KEY if the symmetric key cannot decrypt the message.

($prime,$generator)=
   &amp;rsaref'generateDHparams($primeBits,$subPrimeBits);

This function generates a new prime and generator for Diffie-Hellman
exchange. $primeBits is the length of the DH modulus (prime), and
$subPrimeBits is the order of the generator. $subPrimeBits can be somewhat
smaller than $primeBits without compromising security, and this makes the
exchange go faster. The dhdemo included with RSAREF uses a 512-bit prime and
160-bit subprime, for example.

The function returns RE_MODULUS_LEN if the prime length is invalid, and
RE_NEED_RANDOM if the random generator is not initialized.

($publicValue,$privateValue)=
  &amp;rsaref'setupDHagreement($prime,$generator,$privateValueLen);

This function raises an RE_NEED_RANDOM exception if the random number
generator is not initialized.

$agreedKey=&amp;rsaref'computeDHagreedKey($prime,$generator,
                   $privateValue,$otherPublicValue);

This function raises an RE_DATA exception if the otherPublicValue is longer
than the prime.
