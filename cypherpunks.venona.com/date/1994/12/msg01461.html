WHERE CAN I LEARN ABOUT PGP?

First, get a copy and read the instructions that come with it.  There are
also at least two books on PGP.  I've read the following and think it is
pretty good:

Protect Your Privacy: A Guide for PGP Users
William Stallings
Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-185596-4, $19.95, 300 pages

is available at most technical bookstores and many general bookstores
such as Barnes and Noble. If you order it from National Computer Security
Association (74774.1326@compuserve.com) they will donate $1 of the price
to Phil Zimmermann's legal defense fund.


WHERE CAN I GET THE PGP VERSION DIRECTLY FROM PHILIP ZIMMERMANN?

This is the MIT version.  For several good reasons, Phil is releasing the
main line freeware PGP through MIT, at net-dist.mit.edu.  See a list of sites
that also carry this version, below, or use this WWW URL:

    <A  HREF="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp-form.html">http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp-form.html</A>


WHAT IS PGP 2.6.i?

Stale Schumacher &lt;staalesc@ifi.uio.no&gt; released an international version of
PGP built the "right way."  By "right way," I mean that it uses the latest
MIT code, but uses a different rsaglue.c to use the mpilib instead of RSAREF
for RSA calculations, thus including all the latest bug fixes and features in
the main freeware PGP code line, but frees non-USA persons from the
limitations of the RSAREF license.  This release has been as strongly
endorsed by Philip Zimmermann as he can do without incriminating himself.

Naturally, by not using the RSAREF code for RSA calculations, this version is
not legal for use in the USA (other than limited research, etc.), but is fine
anywhere else (like Canada) were RSA patents don't hold.

Note that the latest version of Stale Schumacher's PGP is 2.6.i, 2.6i
(without the second .) was a beta test version that has been superceded.


WHAT IS PGP 2.6ui?

The "unofficial international" versions are really just PGP 2.3a, modified
just enough to make it compatible with MIT PGP 2.6, but do not include all of
the fixes in MIT PGP 2.6 and MIT PGP 2.6.1.  They have a "ui" somewhere in
their file names.  I recommend the use of the "ui" versions only if you are
using a platform for which there is no Viacrypt or MIT PGP that works
properly.  For a version that doesn't use RSAREF, PGP 2.6.i from Stale
Schumacher is a better choice, because it is more up-to-date.


WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?

If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial and government
environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully compatible with, functionally
the same as, and just as strong as the freeware version of PGP. Due to
limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license, ViaCrypt only distributes
executable code and documentation for it, but they are working on making PGP
available for a variety of platforms.  Call or write to them for the latest
information.  The latest version number for Viacrypt PGP is 2.7.

Here is a brief summary of Viacrypt's currently-available products:

1. ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS.  Prices start at $99.98

2. ViaCrypt PGP for UNIX.  Includes executables for the following
   platforms:

     SunOS 4.1.x (SPARC)
     IBM RS/6000 AIX
     HP 9000 Series 700/800 UX
     SCO 386/486 UNIX
     SGI IRIX
     AViiON DG-UX(88/OPEN)

   Prices start at $149.98

     Executables for the following additional platforms are
     available upon request for an additional $30.00 charge.

     BSD 386
     Ultrix MIPS DECstation 4.x


3. ViaCrypt PGP for WinCIM/CSNav.  A special package for users of
   CompuServe.  Prices start at $119.98

Please contact ViaCrypt for quantity discount pricing.

Orders may be placed by calling 800-536-2664 during the hours of 8:30am to
5:00pm MST, Monday - Friday.  They accept VISA, MasterCard, AMEX and Discover
credit cards.

WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?

These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Because this list changes frequently, I
have not attempted to keep it complete, but there should be enough pointers
to let you easily find PGP.

There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a copy).  Just don't ask
Philip Zimmermann directly for a copy.


FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA

There are some wierd hoops to jump through, thanks to the U. S. Department of
State, at many of these sites.  This is apparently because the U. S.
Department of State wants to make it easier for people outside of North
America to develop, distribute, use, or sell strong cryptographic software
than people inside of the USA and Canada -- at least that is the effect of
their rules.

Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.

MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).

1.  Read <A  HREF="ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt">ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt</A> and agree to it.
2.  Read <A  HREF="ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt">ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt</A> and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (see the above chart for names).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.

You can also get PGP from:

ftp.csn.net/mpj
    See <A  HREF="ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ">ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ</A>

COMPUSERVE

GO NCSAFORUM.  Follow the instructions there to gain access to Library 12: Export
Controlled.  PGP may be other places, too.

Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS (6.3 instead of the
already lame 8.3), so the file names to look for are PGP262.ZIP, PG262S.ZIP
(source code), PGP262.GZ (Unix source code) and PG262D.ZIP (documentation
only).

FTPMAIL

For those individuals who do not have access to FTP, but do have access
to e-mail, you can get FTP files mailed to you.  For information on
this service, send a message saying "Help" to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.
You will be sent an instruction sheet on how to use the ftpmail
service.  It works with messages something like this:

&gt;     To: ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
&gt;     Subject:  Ftpmail request

&gt;     Connect ftp.csua.berkeley.edu
&gt;     chdir pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp262
&gt;     uuencode
&gt;     get pgp262.zip
&gt;     quit

Another e-mail service is from nic.funet.fi. Send mail to mailserv@nic.funet.fi
with the word HELP.

For the ftp sites on netcom, send mail to ftp-request@netcom.com containing
the word HELP in the body of the message.

To get pgp 2.6.i by email:
  Send a message to hypnotech-request@ifi.uio.no with your request in the
  Subject: field.

  Subject             What you will get

  GET pgp26i.zip      MS-DOS executable (uuencoded)
  GET pgp26is.zip     MS-DOS source code (uuencoded)
  GET pgp26is.tar.gz  UNIX source code (uuencoded)

For FAQ information, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq
in the body of the message.


MACPGP OPTIONS

There are multiple parallel efforts to write an up-to-date MacPGP.  See the
following for the latest MacPGP beta stuff. Zbigniew Fiedorowicz
&lt;fiedorow@math.ohio-state.edu&gt; has updated his MacPGP to support Apple
events, and his distribution comes with complete source code. Grady's netcom
directory contains a different version, about which he says "This latest bug
release beta 1.23 fixes several relatively minor bugs.  Source to this

PGP FOR WINDOWS, WINDOWS NT, AND WINDOWS 95

There isn't one, yet, that I know of (at least not a true native Windows
application).  There are several good shells that call the DOS PGP for the
actual work, though.  I use Viacrypt's, but there are others available as
shareware or freeware at most of the sites listed above for PGP itself.


IS MY COPY OF PGP GOOD?

If you find a version of the PGP package that does not include the PGP User's
Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always be included in the
package.  PGP should be signed by one of the developers (Philip Zimmermann,
Jeff Schiller, Viacrypt, Stale Schumacher, etc.).  If it isn't, the package
is suspect and should not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on
should remove it so that it does no further harm to others.  To be really
sure, you should get PGP directly from MIT or check the signatures with a
version of PGP that you trust.  The copies of PGP on ftp.csn.net/mpj,
ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj, and the Colorado Catacombs BBS are direct copies
of the ones on MIT, except that the ones on the BBS include a BBS
advertisement (automatically added by the system when it virus scans new
files) in the outer .zip files.

WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?

For a detailed rant, get <A  HREF="ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip">ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip</A>

The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.  Make sure you
follow the laws of your own country.  If you want to officially export PGP,
you may be able to get permission in limited cases and for a fee.  Contact
the U. S. Department of State for information.


WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?

MIT PGP is only for personal, noncommercial use because of restrictions on
the licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.

For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments (as well as
personal use, of course).

Another restriction is due to an exclusive marketing agreement between Philip
Zimmermann and Viacrypt that applies to the USA and Canada only.  Viacrypt
has exclusive rights to market PGP commercialy in this area of the world.
This means that if you want to market PGP commercially in competition with
Viacrypt in the USA or Canada, you would have to create a new implementation
of the functions of PGP containing none of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted
code.  You are free to modify existing PGP code for your own use, as long as
you don't sell it.  Phil would also appreciate your checking with him before
you distribute any modified versions of PGP as freeware.

"PGP", "Pretty Good Privacy" and "Phil's Pretty Good Software" are trademarks
owned by Philip Zimmermann.  This means that if you modify an older version of
PGP that was issued under the copyleft license and distribute it without
Phil's permission, you have to call it something else.  This avoids confusing
all of us and protects Phil's good name.


WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?

MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license associated with the RSAREF
copyright, which is valid in Canada.

For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.

The exclusive marketing agreement with Viacrypt also applies in Canada.  See
the section on USA intellectual property restrictions for more details.


WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?

MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
license restrictions.  The RSAREF copyright holds outside of the USA, even
though the RSA patent does not.

The IDEA conventional block cipher is covered by US Patent 5,214,703 and
European patent EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
Commercial users of IDEA (including commercial use of PGP) may obtain
licensing details from Ph. Baumann, Ascom Tech Ltd., IDEA Lizenz, Postfach
151, CH-4502 Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel ++41 65 242828, Fax ++41 65 242847.


WHAT IS COMMERCIAL USE?

Use some common sense.  If you are running a business and using PGP to
protect credit card numbers sent to you electronically, then you are using
PGP commercially.  Your customers, however, need not buy the commercial
version of PGP just to buy something from you, if that is the only commercial
use they make of PGP (since they are spending, not making, money with PGP).

If you are just encrypting love letters or other personal mail (for which you
don't get paid) on your own personal computer, that is not commercial.  If
you are encrypting official business mail on your for-profit corporation's
computer with PGP, that is commercial use.

Note that there are some gray areas not covered above, and the patent owners
of RSA and IDEA may differ from my interpretation in the areas not covered
above, so if you are in doubt, you should consider the licensing of Viacrypt
PGP (or outside of North America, direct licensing of IDEA) to be cheap legal
insurance.  Indeed, the license fee is probably a lot cheaper than a legal
opinion from a lawyer qualified to make such a judgement.  Note that I am not
a lawyer and the above is not legal advise.  Use it at your own risk.


WHAT IS THE "TIME BOMB" IN MIT PGP 2.6?

There was a version byte change in MIT PGP 2.6 as of 1 September 1994.  See
<A  HREF="ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc">ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc</A> for details.


ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?

If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the current PGP versions (MIT PGP 2.6, PGP 2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7). If
this is not the case, you really should generate a new key that qualifies.

MIT PGP 2.6.2 should be able to use 2048 bit keys.  Generation of 2048 bit
keys is supposed to automatically be enabled in PGP 2.6.2 in December, 1994.
By then, hopefully, most people will have had a chance to upgrade to a
version of PGP that can use them, so longer keys won't be a big problem.  On
the other hand, 1024 bit keys are probably beyond the reach of most criminals
and spies to break, anyway.

HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?

There are lots of ways.  One way is to use a key server.  Send mail to one of
these addresses with the single word "help" in the subject line to find out
how to use a key server.

        pgp-public-keys@pgp.iastate.edu
        pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu
        pgp-public-keys@pgp.ai.mit.edu
        public-key-server@pgp.ai.mit.edu
        pgp-public-keys@cs.tamu.edu
        pgp-public-keys@chao.sw.oz.au
        pgp-public-keys@jpunix.com
        pgp-public-keys@dsi.unimi.it
        pgp-public-keys@kiae.su
        pgp-public-keys@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de

        There is also an experimental public key server at
        <A  HREF="http://ibd.ar.com/PublicKeys.html">http://ibd.ar.com/PublicKeys.html</A>

There is a commercial key certification and publication service, too. Send
mail to info@Four11.com for information.

You can also mail your key to pgp-public-keys@c2.org, and it will be posted
to the subscribers of that mailing list, sent to the keyservers, and posted
to alt.security.keydist.  To subscribe to the mailing list, send a message to
majordomo@c2.org with "subscribe pgp-public-keys" in the body of the message.

Another way is to upload it to the PGP public keys area of the Colorado
Catacombs BBS (303-772-1062).  Another way is to just send it to your
correspondents.  You could add it to your .plan file so that finger returns
your key.  You could add it to some of your postings.  No matter which way you
do it, you should have your key signed by someone who verifies that your key
belongs to you, so that you don't have someone else generating a key that has
your name on it, but that isn't yours.

Here is my public key:
