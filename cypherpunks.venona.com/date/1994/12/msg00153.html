Paul, 

I appreciate your reply, especially the information that I can use to
reconstruct my account. I never received the mail that Branko
originally sent. Evidently no one received my repeated requests sent
after the first one.

&gt; Sometimes we can react very fast, but alas this is only the case for 
&gt; standard procedures which we did automate.  More specific questions 
&gt; and requests *have* to be handled by humans.  We think the people who are 
&gt; willing to invest quite some effort in setting up a shop for the beta 
&gt; test, are very important participants in the beta test trail.  
&gt; Therefore it seems *very* unlike to us that we didn't respond to *any*
&gt; mail or request from you.  Not trusting our own memory ( we do receive more 
&gt; than 100 (yes, hundred) mails on ecash *each* day, even Sundays) 
&gt; we dove right in to it and found a trail of  DigiCash answers to your mail 
&gt; with the subject: 'Concerns about ecash'.  

I was unclear in my original statement. You, Marcel, and others did
respond to my comments and questions-- specifically to my concerns
about when ecash systems would be available for real use. My upset
came from the fact that once my shop stopped working, I didn't get a
response.

&gt; &gt; Since then, an accident on my WWW server has rendered the e-shop
&gt; &gt; inoperable. I've asked Digicash, in the form of Paul Diniessen, for
&gt; &gt; help reconstructing the bank records. No go.

&gt; Sorry we *did* sent you a respons within an hour from your 
&gt; request by my colleague Branko. He is responsible for our bank in 
&gt; the trial. His respons was:

&gt; -The dbm library used by Linux and FreeBSD are different, so the ecash
&gt; -databases are also incompatible.  If you have a password for getting an
&gt; -initial balance, you can also use this password for reopening your
&gt; -account (and keeping your old balance).  For the server@fairgate.com
&gt; -account you can use the password ********  (pw made invisible PD) for this.
&gt; -
&gt; -Branko

&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, it may well be a matter of incompetence rather than insult,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but the net result is the same.  The more I see of digicash's lack of
&gt; &gt; &gt; consideration towards their potential customers and important figures like
&gt; &gt; &gt; Brands the more I question whether they have the potential to succeed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The more I deal with Digicash, the better First Virtual looks. My
&gt; &gt; technical preference is for using Brands or Chaum cash; at present,
&gt; &gt; though, there aren't any shipping Brands servers, and the Digicash
&gt; &gt; folks don't seem to be able to get all their socks in one bag.

&gt; We feel somewhat troubled by these comments.  We strongly feel that 
&gt; the alleged 'lack of consideration' as unjustified.  First we would 
&gt; like to split up your comment in to two different issues, first 
&gt; regarding our potential customers and secondly the issue of Mr. S. 
&gt; Brands.

First of all, Hal Finney wrote the paragraph which mentions lack of
consideration. My own feelings toward Digicash-- which you confirm--
are that you have more work to do than you can presently handle. I
understand that; it's not uncommon, and I don't hold it against you.
It _does_ hamper my ability to set up services for which I can be paid.

&gt; We like you to consider this phase in the existence of ecash as a 
&gt; genuin beta trail.  In beta test not only software is being trailed 
&gt; but the supporting services too!  However, it should be noted that we 
&gt; did respond to your mail and requests. 

This is a good point. I do understand that this is a beta test, and
that problems will occur. I also want to confirm for other readers
that you did respond to my mail; in the most important case I didn't
get the response.

&gt; We will give a call today to check if received this mail. We hope to 
&gt; resolve the problems mentioned above and to continue our co-operation.

Thanks for your detailed response.

Regards,
- -Paul Robichaux
