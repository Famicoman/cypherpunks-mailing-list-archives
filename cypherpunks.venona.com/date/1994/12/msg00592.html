&gt; Ok, here is the text of the story about the "Forged Bob Rae Posting" from
&gt; the Toronto Globe and Mail. An examination of the story only indicates how
&gt; far our journalists and politicians have to go in understanding the Internet!

Indeed. Let's examine some of the apparent misconceptions....

[quoted text from here to the end is from Rusk &amp; Mittelstaedt of the Globe &amp;
Mail]

&gt;   A furious Mr. Rae criticized Mr. Harris outside the legislature,
&gt; accusing him of leading to the "Americanization of Canadian
&gt; politics" through the use of "dirty tricks.

(ouch :)

[...]
&gt;   Ont.general is a computer bulletin board on which Internet users
&gt; discuss life and public issues in the province, said Larry Sherman,
&gt; president of Internet Seminars of Woodbridge.
&gt;   A message can be removed from the board only by whoever posted it,

No, anyone with a moderately flexible newsreader and a little bit of 
knowledge about news control message syntax can cancel someone else's
article. Tying this in to the discussion about using a newsgroup as a
message pool, notice that news articles are far easier to wipe out than
mail messages. This is potentially a major vulnerability of any such
system, given current news software. Widespread unauthorized cancellations 
(other than for spam) are greatly frowned upon, though, so a concerted 
attack would probably set up a major clash of powers on the net. 

[...]
&gt;   The source of the message was an account that provides a service
&gt; that allows people anonymous access to the Internet, she said.

mail forwarding =/= net access

&gt;   Mr. Sherman said it is very easy to post a false message on a
&gt; bulletin board and to make it appear that it came from a computer
&gt; different from the one that sent it.

True, but that's a claim about forgery, not remailing; this is a worrisome
confusion of terms reminiscent of the hacker/cracker problem.

&gt;   By going through a California bulletin board, "obviously someone
&gt; has gone way out of their way to send that in," Mr. Sherman
&gt; added.

One hopes that Internet Seminars pres. Sherman isn't responsible for the 
absurd implication I infer from this: sending mail via a geographically
distant site requires going out of one's way. Is there some more sensible
interpretation ?  It seems obvious that someone posting an article purporting
to emanate from the Canadian PM would try to transmit it with some level of
indirection.

[...]
&gt;   Last months, the Tories played pranks at an NDP convention
&gt; sending in a camera crew that shot pictures ridiculing Mr. Rae,
&gt; including a doctored video sequence that seemed to give the Premier
&gt; a stutter. The picture were broadcast as dinner-time entertainment
&gt; at a Conservative convention the same weekend.  

Who's learning slimy politics from whom ?
