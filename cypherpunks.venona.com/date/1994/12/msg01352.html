One of the problems with Philip Zimmermann's very worthy voice
encryption project is the lack of support for PC laptops, notebooks and
palmtops that lack soundcards. If anyone involved in this project is
listening, please consider creating a version that will work well with
the PCMCIA "Wavejammer" card or some other peripheral soundcard
substitute.

Cogon Electronics Inc., as has been discussed in this group, markets a
voice encryption program called Aquafone that employs
Diffie-Hellman+triple DES. The current version uses a push-to-talk
feature like a CB radio, but the company plans a fully duplexed version
in March.

Like the Zimmermann project, the Aquafone uses a standard soundcard. 
The company reports mixed results using Wavejammer cards. The audio
quality afforded by the Wavejammer is noticeably inferior to that of a
soundcard. Seems the audio digitization algorithms would have to be
tweaked to optimize the fidelity using the Wavejammer.

BTW, please don't misconstrue this as an advertisement for Wavejammer
or Aquafone. I fully expect Phil's voice encryption software to become
the de facto telephonic standard just as PGP became the Internet
standard. Cogon's Aquafone, while commendable, has the disadvantage of
employing DES. I presume Phil will select a more resilient conventional
algorithm. Cogon also lacks Phil's cachet as certified by his fans at
Justice and Customs. And, of course, the Zimmermann software will be
freeware.

Likewise, I mention Wavejammer because that is the only PCMCIA
substitute for a soundcard with which I am familiar. If someone can
suggest other solutions to the sound card deficiency in PC laptops and
notebooks -- short of buying a Mac or restricting one's selection to
the few PC portables that have internal soundcards -- please do. I
don't regularly monitor this group, so I would greatly appreciate any
replies by e-mail.

This is an important problem to solve. After cryptanalysis, traffic
analysis is the biggest threat to secure telephony. A readily portable
PC armed with Phil's voice encryption program represents a real dilemma
for traffic analysts since one or both targeted parties are no longer
tied to specific telephones. 

I am neither a telecommunications expert nor a programmer. I am a civil
liberties activist. Periodically, from the safety of the United States,
I must communicate with people whose courage and idealism puts them in
jeopardy of hostile parties. PGP is quite popular in such circles. As
you might expect, Phil's voice encryption software is awaited with
equal enthusiasm.
