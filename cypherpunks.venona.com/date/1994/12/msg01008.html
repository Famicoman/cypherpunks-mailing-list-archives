&gt; &gt;It may be backward, but it is how a huge fraction of the list accesses
&gt; &gt;the Net. Am I wrong on this? Dial-up access to local POPs is a fact of
&gt; &gt;life for many, many people.

[...]

&gt; &gt;guess is that fewer than 20% of the list are directly SLIP- or
&gt; &gt;PPP-connected, with good access to the tools praised here by Amanda,
&gt; &gt;Perry, you, and others.
&gt; 
&gt; I have the same type of shell account with Netcom that you have. However,
&gt; thanks to The Internet Adapter I turned that shell account into a SLIP
&gt; connection. If you have a shell account, you can convert it into a SLIP
&gt; account. It is as simple as that. Not that it mattered much for MIME email.
&gt; Eudora can handle that via dial-up just as well. Sure helps for browsers,
&gt; though. Accessing the web through Lynx is a joke. Even if you have image
&gt; loading turned off in the browser to conserve bandwidth, _anything_ is
&gt; better than Lynx.

So, I'm running a Mac //cx with a shell account at the moment.  I have a 
lowly 14.4k connection.

What solution do you have for the user who has no direct connection to 
the net, has merely a modem speed bandwidth, and is in a non-isdn area?

I often need to pull large files over 3 megs into my shell account at 
high speeds.  (60-100 kb/sec)  Impossible with SLIP.

Are you telling me that I can do this and still have the advantage of SLIP?

Forgive my ignorance, but you'll have to enlighten me.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For reasons I just addressed in another post, I foresee being on a
&gt; &gt;dial-up (not a SLIP or PPP, that is) for a while. And I have relatively
&gt; &gt;few complaints about it. My service provider keeps the 9446 current
&gt; &gt;newsgroups, provides ftp and suchlike tools, and I don't have to be a
&gt; &gt;sysadmin. Frankly, if I have to choose between not being able to see
&gt; &gt;someone's MIMEd GIF and becoming a Unix sysadmin for my own site, I'll
&gt; &gt;skip the GIFs.

Same balance for me when it comes to the transfer rate.

&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps we can find some common ground here. You don't want to have to use
&gt; UNIX. You like your Mac, don't you? So why interact with a lousy terminal
&gt; server if you can do all the things you can do there - and more - the Mac
&gt; way? Think about it. All the benefits of a Mac interface without giving up
&gt; the benefits you get from Netcom. (No, I don't work for TIA. I am just a
&gt; VERY satisfied customer.)
&gt;

So how much am I expected to "shell out" ?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I'd like to see some evidence that I am one of the last of my tribe.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Call me Ishi.
&gt; 

Sorry Tim, I'm with you.  You're not alone yet.

&gt; You are fighting a lost cause and you know it. VT100 is dead. No, you are
&gt; not the last of your tribe. I should hope that you have the good sense to
&gt; come around before that happens. All your friends here sure hope for it.
&gt;

I'll come around when I'm sure I'm not losing anything.

Convince me.
