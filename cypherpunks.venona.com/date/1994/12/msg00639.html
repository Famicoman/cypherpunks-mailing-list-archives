&gt; &gt;HTTP, like SMTP, is only a transport for underlying documents. The
&gt; &gt;underlying documents are the things people wish to secure, not the
&gt; &gt;transport layer.  By securing only the transport, you make it possible
&gt; &gt;for people to get pages that are forged, although they can be sure of
&gt; &gt;what machine delivered them (which isn't significant). Your system is,
&gt; &gt;for instance, useless in a proxy HTTP daemon environment.
&gt; 
&gt; I was going to say that an SSL-aware proxy daemon could play "man in
&gt; the middle" and pass through the SSL handshaking messages which occur
&gt; at connection time, so that the user client could authenticate the
&gt; remote server, then communicate using a key shared with that server but
&gt; which the proxy would not know.
&gt; 
&gt; But that won't work with SSL, I guess.  The SSL handshaking goes on
&gt; before any message data has been exchanged; in particular, before the
&gt; URL is sent to the proxy to tell it what server to connect to.  (Hiding
&gt; URL's is one of the features of SSL.) So in fact with SSL the only
&gt; authentication possible is between proxy and user, and then between
&gt; proxy and remote server.  There doesn't seem to be a place in the
&gt; protocol where the user could authenticate the remote server and create
&gt; a key which would not be known to the proxy.  This does seem to be a
&gt; deficiency.

First, let me clarify slightly. The only place where a problem occurs
currently is if the server is attempting to authenticate the client.
Because the proxy agent cannot reliably act as an agent for a client,
it cannot properly answer a servers authentication requests.

I can imagine several solutions to this thorny problem:

1. Client connects securely to a proxy agent using SSL. Upon
   establishment of the secure connection, the request is transmitted to
   the proxy. If the request is to a secure document (the proxy can tell
   by examining the URL) (and the client can tell), then the client
   re-enters the SSL handshake protocol from the start and the proxy
   agent turns into a data forwarder ala sockd.

   This is technically a change to the proxy protocol, but requires no
   change to the SSL protocol. Of course, to teach proxies about security
   requires *some* change...

2. The client connects insecurly to a proxy agent using current
   methods. The client requests a secure document. The proxy agent
   connects to the secure server using SSL and attempts to act as the
   client's agent in the transaction. Note that the user must consider
   this an insecure connection, and trust it only as far as she/he trusts
   the proxy server.

   Most of the time, the proxy will work. However, when client authentication
   is performed, the proxy fails as it should. If one were to construct a
   "trusted" proxy, then in theory it could perform the client authentication,
   acting as an agent for the client. However, this seems kinda scary to me,
   so I can't say I recommend it. To do this would require the client to
   transmit its authentication information to the proxy agent, which seems
   like a really bad idea.

3. SSL has a notion of a "security escape" of which there are currently no
   applications. One could define a security escape to allow enveloping of
   the authentication information needed by the final server so that the
   client can properly respond to authentication requests. I haven't thought
   this thru yet.
