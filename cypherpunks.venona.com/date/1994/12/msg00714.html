Eric # Perhaps you don't know the meaning of whitespace and paragraph breaks.
James &gt; And then he contradicts himself:
# I did claim you were arguing from libertarian correctness.  Now that's
# just an insult, which I do not retract. [...]
# Oh, please.  Go back and read what I originally wrote.  Perhaps I
# overestimate your ability to ascertain relevance, though.
&gt; You do not demonstrate much ability to think rationally
&gt; in this posting.  A self contradiction in three lines,
&gt; above, and some interesting logic to follow:
[...]
# This is not an argument.  This is a premise. 
&gt; I see:  So you start off with the assumption that what
&gt; I was arguing was false, and because that is a premise 
&gt; not an argument, you do not have to defend it or support it. 

"I do not need to PROVE these FACTS because they are INCORRECT and because I
do not NEED to PROVE them they must be TRUE!!!" --James `Kibo' Parry, 2/22/94

&gt; Nice piece of logic there.
&gt; I accused you of flaming before reading.  Now you claim
&gt; that you did read it, but the laws of logic exempt you
&gt; from having to make rational criticism of what I wrote.
&gt; I think your defense denigrates you more than my original 
&gt; accusation did. 
&gt; Now back to some slight crypto relevance:
[...]

*heavy sigh*

Eric &amp; James, how about taking the "You're flaming me !" "No, I'm just 
insulting you !" portion of this debate to private email ?  I sincerely
doubt that very many people on the list give a damn about any of the above
jousting.

&gt; Each posting I made was about the standards making process.

Sticking to flaming about Internet standards, rather than flaming about who
didn't read whose argument carefully, would be much more productive IMHO.
