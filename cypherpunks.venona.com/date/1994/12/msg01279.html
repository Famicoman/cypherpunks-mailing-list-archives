&gt;&gt; GROAN! What the hell is this list about anyway?????? I think we are losing

&gt;You said it.

And the defense thereof.....

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Putting it quite simply, the individual was asking about how to make an attack
&gt;&gt; on an opponent. Whether that opponent is a girlfriend, spouse, competitor or
&gt;&gt; terrorist group, who cares? Lets save the sermonizing for Ann Landers...what
&gt;&gt; state the relationship is irrelevant.
&gt;
&gt;And *HE* gave the reason - he wanted go rifling through his girlfriend's
&gt;private files.  And here I was, thinking that this list was about "better
&gt;privacy through cryptography" - I must have subscribed to alt.2600 by
&gt;mistake...  Come to think of it, that's a better place for the original
&gt;query...

Gee...I guess we shouldn't get too concerned when gov't agencies try to
break OUR communications on a large scale ...or maybe the cypherpunk
system of remailers were set up just as a hobby...


&gt;
&gt;&gt; The gentleman asked a question regarding a standard cryptographic problem...
&gt;&gt; how you can intercept and interpret encrypted information, either in theory
&gt;&gt; in practice. To make judgement calls is WAY out of line and a hell of a bad
&gt;&gt; precedent for this group.
&gt;
&gt;Read it again - he specifically wanted to sneak into his partner's files;
&gt;that is a clear invasion of privacy.  Jeeze - I thought a Yank would have
&gt;understood this...

Sorry....I'm Canadian......and sure. He wanted to sneak into his partners
files. What a strange cryptographic concept that happens to be....

&gt;
&gt;&gt; I bet the poster would have gotten a more sympathetic response if he said he
&gt;&gt; had gotton his hands on a diplomatic cable....
&gt;
&gt;And would you have been just as sympathetic if somebody wanted to rifle
&gt;YOUR files?

Yup! Alls fair in luv...or WAR! If you aren't prepared to play the game,
then stay at home!!

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Oh boy! Pretty soon we will have this list as "cypherpunks giving advice to
&gt;&gt; the lovelorn..."!!! Lets cut the crap, stick to the problem at hand and
&gt;&gt; offer solutions to what the participants of the list know best, namely the
&gt;&gt; the use and analysis of cryptographic problems.
&gt;
&gt;That has nothing to do with it - person A wanted advice on how to invade
&gt;person B's privacy (he presumably doesn't have the guts to just ask her).
&gt;Sorry, but privacy works both ways - she's entitled to it just as much
&gt;as anybody else.

Just like the Japanese were entitled to THEIR privacy before Midway, eh?
