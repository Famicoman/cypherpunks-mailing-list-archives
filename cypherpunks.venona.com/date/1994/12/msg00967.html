&gt;Why is it possible for someone other than ME to add MY key to a keyserver?
&gt;I realize that at some point (perhaps only the first time you submit a
&gt;key?), there has to be some trust model employed, but it seems like this
&gt;anyone-can-submit-anyone-else's-key situation offers a very obvious attack:
&gt;anyone could propagate bogus keys across the net by just generating bogus
&gt;keys with someone else's email/name on them, leading to massive
&gt;impersonation problems.

Yes, there are such possibilitied.

&gt;Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but it seems like there should be a
&gt;more rigorous method available to, and employed by, keyserver operators for
&gt;verifying someone's identity before accepting a key submitted (supposedly)
&gt;by them. Shouldn't the key submission msg itself at minimum be required to
&gt;be contained within a signed msg from someone with enough "nearness" in
&gt;trust levels from some trusted introducer known to the keyserver op? I
&gt;thought this sort of situation was precisely the reason for the trust level
&gt;system in PGP in the first place.

&gt;This may be a can of worms (or not), but if cpunks require fairly decent
&gt;methods for verifying the identities of people who want to trade keys with
&gt;them personally, then it seems keyservers should require at LEAST that
&gt;level of verification (or better).

Sure.  Are you offering to do the coding?

&gt;I'd like to CLEAR/REMOVE ALL keys from ALL keyservers that are:
&gt;  - attributed to me by others (without my knowledge)
&gt;  - added by others (unknown to me)
&gt;  - purporting to have been generated by me)
&gt;and start with a tabula rasa. Maybe in a few weeks, once all these (what I
&gt;consider to be) bogus keys are GONE, I can add my actual key to a
&gt;keyserver.

Until someone writes code to deal with owner-submission (or whatever)
you're SOL.  Even if all the operators were to delete all of your keys,
someone would eventually mail their entire ring to a server, and those
bogus keys would be back up again.

You mentioned that you didn't keep your secret key for one of your
now-defunct keys.  Why not?  Are the servers supposed to clean up after
you now too?

&gt;There doesn't seem to be any elegant mechanism available for doing this
&gt;yet, but I'm ready to be educated on this point. Any comments?

Do you know how to code in Perl?  Code submissions welcome.
