&gt;that's the problem that jrochkin was addressing.  he has a pgp encrypted

Well, no, not really.
My problem was that a user would send me their public key, inside of a
signed message, and the "BEGIN PUBLIC KEY" stuff would have the "- " on it.
Which means that before I can add it to my keyring, I've got to edit out
the extra "- "s, and then save it in a file, and then pass it through PGP,
instead of just passing the original message though PGP, or using the Mac
"copy" command on a part of the message and sending that through PGP.
Or someone sends me an encrypted address block inside a signed message, and
I've got to do the same before I can use it.

I now understand why PGP does what it does, but it's still a pain. Perhaps
the ideal mail reading program would run my incoming mail through PGP
before I even saw it, so I wouldn't have this problem. Well, actually not.
My ideal mail reader would check the signatures before I saw them, but
would also leave them intact on the message, so I could re-check them
myself manually if I wanted.  Oh well.  It's not a limitation on
functionality of any kind, just on convenience.
