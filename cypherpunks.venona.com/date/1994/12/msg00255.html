&gt;Subject: future entrapment
&gt;
&gt;Something to think about...(fwd)
&gt;
&gt;Thought you all might be interested in this excerpt from CPSR list regarding
&gt;copyrights on the Net and especially how police can use the Web to set up
&gt;stings.

&gt;To: cpsr-global@cpsr.org
&gt;
&gt;Philosophically, I see most journalists as being filters. Some of us
&gt;read press releases, strip out the propaganda, and supply the results
&gt;(with interpretation) to the public. Some of us go and try to nail
&gt;down the story by poking around and asking questions. But ultimately
&gt;we rely on sensory input at some level -- and all we do is rearrange
&gt;it, comment on it (by referring to prior input), and punt it out again
&gt;at our readers.  This is fundamentally an editorial process, and there
&gt;will be more need for it -- not less -- as the information deluge
&gt;gathers momentum.
&gt;
&gt;There's a huge problem on the net: how does copyright apply to a reference?
&gt;For example: I can't stitch a Far Side cartoon into my WWW home page. But
&gt;I _can_ embed an &lt;IMG SRC= ...&gt; directive in my page, pointing to a Far
&gt;Side cartoon that is _legitimately_ stored somewhere else on the net. When
&gt;you look at my page you will see the cartoon ... and will have a bit of a
&gt;headache when you stop to think about the copyright implications.
&gt;
&gt;The precise question of what constitutes a copyright violation runs
&gt;into a wall of mud as soon as you start asking questions about sources
&gt;and hyperlinks. For example, here's the kind of havoc you can wreak by
&gt;classifying all embedded link dereferences as deliberate actions.
&gt;Suppose I am a cop in some redneck area, and I want to nail someone
&gt;who uses the net locally.  I could run a _very_ neat entrapment sting
&gt;to nail people for posession of kiddie porn:
&gt;
&gt;*       establish a local WWW server hosting some useful information
&gt;*       configure the server to record the IP addresses of people who
&gt;        access it, and cross-reference them to obtain geographical
&gt;        locations as registered with NIC. Feed this into a GIS and
&gt;        track local accesses.
&gt;*       have a list of people who I want  to nail.
&gt;*       filter all HTTP requests through a script that
&gt;        -       checks the list of victims
&gt;        -       if a request for a file comes in from one of the
&gt;                targets, munge the outgoing web page to include
&gt;                a &lt;IMG SRC= ...&gt; tag pointing to a foreign site
&gt;                carrying images deemed pornographic in my jurisdiction
&gt;        -       ring the console bell
&gt;
&gt;As soon as someone on the hit list downloads a file, you have prima
&gt;facie evidence that they are probably in posession of some kiddie porn.
&gt;Instant search warrant time ...
&gt;
&gt;(And in case you were wondering, this is just a technology twist on top
&gt;of the recent Adult Action BBS case in Mississippi.)
&gt;
&gt;Basically, as far as I can see, conventional notions of copyright are
&gt;going to have to change -- because copying is no longer the only mechanism
&gt;for gaining posession of information. Our notions of intellectual property
&gt;may also have to change ...
