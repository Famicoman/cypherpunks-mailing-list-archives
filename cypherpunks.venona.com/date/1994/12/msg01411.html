&gt; dmandl&gt; Pseudo-individualist Republican rubbish...
&gt; 
&gt; As a pedigreed piece of Pseudo-individualist Republican rubbish (PIRR)
&gt; myself, I take exception to that remark. Associating noble PIRR with
&gt; pseudonyms named for inappropriately-colored fictional creatures really
&gt; gets my, ahem, goat.

Hey, your talking about a creature that's been in my family for 
generations, bub.

&gt; It seems to me the proper answer to the original poster of this thread was
&gt; to greet it with a deafening silence. First, because the answer is trivial
&gt; given the technical level of this list (well, the average technical level,
&gt; anyway) and can be obtained elsewhere. Second, because there is such a
&gt; diversity of ethics, politics, and moral belief on this list, because the
&gt; fundemental nature of the technology we discuss here and its potential
&gt; impact on human society is so great, to address the question on its merits
&gt; would unleash enough verbal flatulatence (including my own, I'm afraid) to
&gt; rival even the best Mel Brooks epic.

Exactly.

&gt; To employ an appropriately PIRR sports metaphor, the question was a pitch
&gt; so *obviously* a slow lob over the plate, such an *easy* target for
&gt; flamage, that it should have been very apparent to anybody here that it
&gt; wouldn't have been fair at all to the pitcher to even swing at it.

*Sound of hammer hitting nail on head*

&gt; Short of letting it fall into the mitt with a dull thud, a pointer to the
&gt; appropriate HAKK3r d00d list would have been the next best thing. This was
&gt; done. Next on the list would be actually answering the question as quickly
&gt; as possible. This was done. (Thank you, Perry.) The quierant will probably
&gt; not be able to execute the proper solution anyway. He'll probably run out
&gt; of steam before executing it, and if he does it anyway, he deserves all the
&gt; shit he'll find himself in upon decrypting those files.  We were all young
&gt; and stupid once. Some of us still are, it appears.

Yes. (To all)

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; I meant to cast no asparagas upon he/she/it's choice of nym-name.

His choice of nym-name.  My hooves are tough.
