&gt; One thing I do notice on reading the discussion in can.politics is the
&gt; fact that despite the disclaimers in the message headers, some people
&gt; took this as a forgery attempt on my part.  I wonder if it might be
&gt; necessary to insert disclaimers into the body of the message as
&gt; anon.penet.fi does, at least for messages to known mail-to-news
&gt; gateways.
&gt; 
&gt; There was also a misperception that my remailer was an official effort
&gt; endorsed by Portal (again, despite the disclaimers).  Note that it was
&gt; they who were contacted, not me (yet).  This might suggest that it will
&gt; not be possible to cleanly separate the remailer operators and service
&gt; providers when problems like this arise.  Both may end up being hassled
&gt; (time will tell whether I am).

This is all too familiar to me. Although I still haven't heard the official
line on the shutdown of Underdog following the Scythe spam, at least some 
people locally (including, crucially, my advisor) received the impression that
I had forged (and authored !) the offending news articles in spite of the
disclaimer headers.

Furthermore, the spam might not have been a fatal blow if not for the fact
that some people ignored the "complaints to &lt;lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu&gt;" 
header and wrote directly to root or postmaster here. Everyone who actually
wrote to me came away satisfied that I was taking appropriate action, as 
far as I could tell.

I'll take this opportunity to reiterate that I'm no longer operating a 
remailer at this address. I wrote to Matt Ghio about a week ago asking him
to remove my address from remailer-pings@chaos.bsu.edu, but I suppose he's
busy with school these days. That list remains frozen with information 
dating from Nov.22. Karl Barrus mentioned something about chaos.bsu.edu
having moved to chaos.taylored.com; perhaps this is part of the reason for
the snag ?
