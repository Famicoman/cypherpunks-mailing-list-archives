Welcome to the fifth issue of CIAC Notes, the United States Department of
Energy's (DOE) Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) electronic
publication for articles on relevant computer security topics.  This "E-zine"
is a service requested by our DOE and DOE contractor customers, and is open
to subscription by anyone who can receive E-mail via the Internet. 
Hopefully we are giving you a gift of information to close out 1994.  If you
have topics you would like addressed or have feedback on this issue, please
contact the editor, Allan L. Van Lehn, CIAC, (510) 422-8193 or send E-mail to

&gt;It is possible
&gt;to create a file that remaps keys when displayed on a PC/MS-DOS machine with
&gt;the ANSI.SYS driver loaded. However, this only works on PC/MS-DOS machines
&gt;with the text displayed on the screen in text mode.  It would not work in
&gt;Windows or in most text editors or mailers.  A key could be remapped to
&gt;produce any command sequence when pressed, for example DEL or FORMAT. 
&gt;However, the command is not issued until the remapped key is pressed and the
&gt;command issued by the remapped key would be visible on the screen.  You could
&gt;protect yourself by removing ANSI.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file, but many DOS
&gt;programs use the functionality of ANSI.SYS to control screen functions and
&gt;colors.  Windows programs are not effected by ANSI.SYS, though a DOS program
&gt;running in Windows would be.

Data Physician Plus! 4.0E Available
All DOE sites should now have Data Physician Plus! 4.0E for use on IMBpc
compatable systems.  Contact your site CPPM if you have not obtained an
update.  This version does provide protection from the KAOS4 and One_half
viruses (see CIAC Bulletin E-32 for further information on KAOS4 and E-34 for
information on One_half). 

- ------------------------------
Novell NetWare Users
CIAC is receiving more and more calls from our DOE clients asking for
information on minimizing the risks associated with installing NetWare and in
further connecting these LANs to the Internet.  To supplement our own
experiences CIAC is interested in partnering with other experts to create a
comprehensive package of information that could be made available to all
sites.  If you have Novell NetWare expertise and would like to be a CIAC
associate, please send a note to ciac@llnl.gov.

CIAC's Electronic Publications
Previous CIAC Bulletins and other information are available via anonymous FTP
from ciac.llnl.gov. 

CIAC has several self-subscribing mailing lists for electronic publications: 
1. CIAC-BULLETIN for Advisories, highest priority -time critical information
and Bulletins, important computer security information; 
2. CIAC-NOTES for Notes, a collection of computer security articles; 
3. SPI-ANNOUNCE for official news about Security Profile Inspector (SPI)
software updates, new features, distribution and availability; 
4. SPI-NOTES, for discussion of problems and solutions regarding the use of
SPI products. 

Our mailing lists are managed by a public domain software package called
ListProcessor, which ignores E-mail header subject lines.  To subscribe (add
yourself) to one of our mailing lists, send requests of the following form: 

	subscribe list-name  LastName, FirstName PhoneNumber

as the E-mail message body, substituting CIAC-BULLETIN, CIAC-NOTES,
SPI-ANNOUNCE or SPI-NOTES for list-name and valid information for LastName
FirstName and PhoneNumber.
Send to: ciac-listproc@llnl.gov   (not to: ciac@llnl.gov) 

e.g.,
	subscribe ciac-notes O'Hara, Scarlett W. 404-555-1212 x36
	subscribe ciac-bulletin O'Hara, Scarlett W. 404-555-1212 x36

You will receive an acknowledgment containing address, initial PIN, and
information on how to change either of them, cancel your subscription, or get
help.  To subscribe an address which is a distribution list, first subscribe
the person responsible for your distribution list.  You will receive an
acknowledgment (as described above).  Change the address to the distribution
list by sending a second E-mail request.  As the body of this message, send
the following request, substituting valid information for list-name, PIN, and
address of the distribution list:.  Send 

E-mail to	ciac-listproc@llnl.gov:
	set list-name  address  PIN   distribution_list_address
  e.g.,	set ciac-notes address 001860 rE-mailer@tara.georgia.orb

To be removed from this mailing list, send the following request: 
unsubscribe  list-name

For more information, send the following request:
help

If you have any questions about this list, you may contact the list's owner:
listmanager@cheetah.llnl.gov. 

- ------------------------------
Accessing CIAC's Electronic Information Servers
CIAC operates a security information server for anonymous FTP at
ciac.llnl.gov which contains all of the publicly available CIAC, CERT/cc,
NIST, and DDN bulletins, virus descriptions, the virus-l moderated virus
bulletin board, copies of public domain and shareware virus
detection/protection software, copies of useful public domain and shareware
utility programs, and patch files for some operating systems. 

Use FTP to access it either by name or IP address (128.115.19.53).  The
operation and prompt will depend on which vendor's FTP you are running. 
Usually, you must first log in before you can list directory contents and
transfer files.  Use "FTP" or "anonymous" for Name or Foreign username unless
given a general prompt such as ciac.llnl.gov&gt; or FTP&gt;. In that case, enter
the keyword "user" or "login" before "FTP" or "anonymous" (e.g., user FTP). 
Use your Internet E-mail address for the Password. 

Once logged in you may type a question mark to find out what key-words are
recognized.  The file 0-index.txt (in the top level directory /FTP) is a
document explaining the directory structure for downloadable files.  The file
whatsnew.txt (in directory /FTP/pub/ciac) contains a list of the new files
placed in the archive.  Use the command get [for single files] or mget [for
multiple files] to download one or more files to your own machine. 

- ------------------------------
Publications Available from CIAC
CIAC prepares publications on a variety of computer security related topics,
the CIAC 2300 series.  Many of these will be updated as needed to keep the
information current.  We welcome suggestions for topics that you feel would
be valuable.  We also make available some documents from other sources.  In
the table below, column E is for electronic documents available via CIAC's
servers (see above).  Column P is for printed documents, for those who do not
have Internet or telephone-modem access.  If neither column is checked, the
document is soon to be released.  The electronic formats are: *.txt for
ASCII, *.ps for PostScript(tm), *.hqx for bin-hexed Microsoft Word, *.wp5 for
PC Word Perfect v5.0.
