&gt;    Not that easy. They would just crack the code and *another*
&gt;    acronym based agency would come up with a different reason to
&gt;    seize you and your computer. It would seem unrelated to anyone
&gt;    but *you* since you would know what you did but would have no
&gt;    way to prove that your original infraction is why you are doin'
&gt;    time.  Hope that makes some sense.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe.  What if the only way to do this was illegal?

    Then you would have to hope you never do anything illegal. Then 
    no (pick your acronym) agency would be able to easily trump up    
    a charge that could be used as an infiltration technique to get 
    to your system *legally*. If they want to bad enuff I'm sure 
    breaking the law to catch you doing something would be arranged.
    Violating National Interests maybe?

&gt;    If it isn't something *really good* they probably wouldn't come after
&gt;    you anyway.

&gt;Whats the definition of GOOD?
    
    PGP?...3xDES?....RC5?....plans for an A-Bomb with instructions for
    construction and location of available nuclear material?...pick one.

&gt;    #3 I can agree with. I don't think that NSA would tip their hand
&gt;    and let on to us that they can read our stuff. At least, not directly.

&gt;We may as well find out.
    
    Agreed, the problem is finding a way to be sure! A little
    misinformation has a habit of going a long way.
    
&gt;    One more thing. Don't you think that they subscribe to the Cypherpunk
&gt;    list just to see this kind of logic?

&gt;Maybe, But isnt freedom of speech what this list is about and what your
&gt;constitution does!

    
        Be careful...not everyone here is a U.S. resident or citizen.
        At least I don't think so.
        But since I am I know how precariously balanced the definition
        of free specch is. The Supreme Court in cahoots with law
        enforcement and lawmakers could change things pretty quick!
        Throw in a handy list of names......u know the rest.
    
&gt;   BTW....I ain't one of 'em, and I wouldn't tell if I was.   :)


&gt;Prove it

[I see my smiley was disregarded]

Proof you say!
A classical dilemma:
        If I say I am (one of them) it implies gathering
        intelligence or a reason to sow suspicion even if I am not.
        Denial implies I am what I say I am not.
        So, even though I am not, it would be impossible to *convince*
        you of that. If I was I still couldn't produce *believable*
        evidence to support the statement.
        Take my advice: Don't Trust Nobody.
