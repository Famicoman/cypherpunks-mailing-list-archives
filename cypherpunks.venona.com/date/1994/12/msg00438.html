&gt;If you really want to test NSA.  Encrypt some crypto code
&gt;with pgp in an overseas public key(IE: non-us) then email the
&gt;code to someone out of the us.  This way you will find out 1 of 2
&gt;things.
&gt;       1.  That pgp is unbreakable by the NSA
&gt;          - Rsa with fairly log keys take so much work the nsa
&gt;            cant crack it with huge computers.  This is a good
&gt;            thing
    
    Not that easy. They would just crack the code and *another*
    acronym based agency would come up with a different reason to 
    seize you and your computer. It would seem unrelated to anyone
    but *you* since you would know what you did but would have no 
    way to prove that your original infraction is why you are doin'
    time.  Hope that makes some sense.

&gt;
&gt;          - Idea, even though it is new, is a secure algorithm
&gt;            for the above reasons
&gt;
    Same argument...no one would ever know either way. Until you got 
    out in about 100 years.

&gt;
&gt;          - You wont get in trouble as you are only sending
&gt;            random bits out of the country not code

    If it isn't something *really good* they probably wouldn't come after
    you anyway.     
&gt;
&gt;      2.  PGP is BREAKABLE by the NSA (OUCH!)
&gt;          - You get in deep shit!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;      or
&gt;
&gt;      3. PGP is breakable by the NSA but they dont tell anyone! (HMMM)

    #3 I can agree with. I don't think that NSA would tip their hand
    and let on to us that they can read our stuff. At least, not directly.

&gt;
&gt;          - Well this would be an interesting one!
&gt;
&gt;          - Since they are the ones that imposed the ITAR rule in the
&gt;           first place (them or the us gov) they have a prob!  If
&gt;            they knew you were exporting crypto because they cracked
&gt;            pgp they could not convict you as that would imply they cracked
&gt;            pgp and they would tell the whole world what they can &amp;
&gt;            cannot crack.  It would be a big bummer for RSA and IDEA
&gt;            but at least we`d know!

    
    One more thing. Don't you think that they subscribe to the Cypherpunk
    list just to see this kind of logic?
    BTW....I ain't one of 'em, and I wouldn't tell if I was.   :)
