The lead article in the news section is an anti-Clipper piece by me.  The
news editor of High Times (Bill Weinberg) is a good friend of mine and an
anarchist.  He invited me to write the article.  He definitely appreciates
this stuff (though he's not a techie himself).

P.S.: Wednesday, I gave the first-ever Lower East Side schoolyard teach-in
on crypto.  The place where the talk was supposed to be held (ABC No Rio)
got padlocked by the cops at the last minute (the city's been trying to
evict them for years), so we just went across the street and held the event
in a schoolyard.  Basketball games and baby carriages all around us.  It
was a lot of fun.  Sort of felt like I was in the TV show "Room 222."

&gt;
&gt;There's an article that's pretty reasonable called "Cyber-Hydroponics"
&gt; [by "Bucky Dave and Garbled Uplink"], discussing anonymous
&gt; remailers (PGP is discussed in another article) and schemes that
&gt; remind me of the "Little Brother Inside" idea.  Included in the
&gt; article is a list of anonymous remailers: it's very interesting
&gt; to note that the list includes the cypherpunks remailers but *not*
&gt; the penet.fi one.  Somebody has a clue.
&gt;
&gt;The article is primarily about controlling systems through anonymous
&gt; remailers: setting up a space to grow pot in and controlling and
&gt; monitoring it remotely entirely untracably through remailers.  A very
&gt; interesting application.
&gt;
&gt;If there's sufficient interest, the article could be send to
&gt; cypherpunks.  I'd recommend picking up the issue, even if you have
&gt; no interest in psychoactives.  It's also got an article on erosion
&gt; of constitutional rights, something that the readership of High
&gt; Times is in a particularly good position to appreciate.
&gt;
&gt;This should be interesting: this is reaching a wide audience of folks
&gt; who have a very real need for secure communications, who have good
&gt; reason to be paranoid.  I can easily envision a mailing list based
&gt; upon the PGP-majordomo mechanisms discussed earlier dedicated to
&gt; growing pot (Did anybody do any coding on that?), the subscribers
&gt; being totally anonymous.
&gt;
&gt;Open the floodgates wide...
