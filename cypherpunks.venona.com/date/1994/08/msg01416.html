&gt;Another argument sometimes advanced in favor of trustworthy escrow
&gt;agents is the "iterated prisoner's dilemma".  This refers to Axelrod's
&gt;simulations of computer program agents which repeatedly interacted in
&gt;a simple "prisoner's dilemma" game which captures much of the essence
&gt;of the trust relationship (see his book "The Evolution of Cooperation").

&gt;His results generally have consistently shown that agents which are
&gt;never the first to "cheat" in a relationship do better than those
&gt;which try to take advantage of their counterparts.
 . . .
&gt;Axelrod's tournaments were predicated on the implicit
&gt;assumption of an indefinite number of interactions.  (This is my
&gt;recollection; I'd be interested in whether experiments have been tried
&gt;with a known fixed number of interactions, and the agents knowing how
&gt;many more there were.)  It had long been recognized (pre-Axelrod) that
&gt;the prisoner's dilemma might reach a stable cooperative solution with
&gt;multiple interactions, but that this becomes unstable if the parties
&gt;know that they are reaching the end of their interaction period.

Axelrod's second tournament had a variable number of interactions,
precisely to defeat penultimate-interaction attacks.  He added this
specifically because his first tournament had a fixed and known number
of interactions, and several programs took advantage of it.  However,
even in the first tournament, the "nice" programs did better than the
"mean" programs, and Tit-for-Tat was the winner.

I suppose this doesn't prove much, insofar as a Tit-for-Tat-but-
Screw-Em-on-the-Last-Round program would probably have come in first
had it been entered.  Even so, I expect that the marginal increase in
score over Tit-for-Tat would have been vanishingly small for a large
number of interactions.
