&gt; I heard exactly the opposite, that studies have shown no difference

I don't know; this was just one cop's opinion based upon his experience.  He
said most of his offenders were in their late 40s, having picked up a heroin
problem after taking mophine in Vietnam, and they were doing all sorts of
crazy (and stupid) things to support their habits.  He said that the drug
problem was 'getting better' because many of the junkies were dying from
overdoses, and fewer of the younger generation were getting involved in
that type of thing.  YMMV depending on which part of the country you live in.

You're right, this isn't crypto, but I suppose the war on drugs does bring up
some privacy issues...
