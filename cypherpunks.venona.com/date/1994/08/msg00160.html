In article &lt;199407282120.RAA07884@cs.oberlin.edu&gt; you write:
&gt;One naive solution would be for remailers to have a "ping" function. I could
&gt;send a remailer a "ping" message, and it would just bounce some acknowledgement
&gt;back. More likely, my software could do this periodically, and keep track
&gt;of which remailers are down, or non existent, and not use those. 
&gt;The problem here is that an eavesdropper could get knowledge of which remailers
&gt;I am planning on using, which could help traffic analysis enormously. 
&gt;The "ping" function could support anon encryption block, so that I can
&gt;ping a remailer through several other remailers anonymously. This is an
&gt;improvement, but the traffic generated by lots of people periodically doing
&gt;this is going to be enormous. As it is in any implementation of this sort. 
&gt;[If you wanted to, you could make the remailers "ping" now by yourslef, just 
&gt;have a message resent to yourself. But we can't all do this automatically often,
&gt;simply because of the traffic it woudl generate. I think.]

I thought extra useless junk traffic was one main objective of a
remailing network?   The more the better..  As far as the idea
that an eavesdropper could tell which remailers you are going to
use - they already know.  They can ping the same sites you do
and as long as you ping *every* site you know of, instead of
just the ones you'd like to use on any given message, this
doesn't give the spooks one iota of new information.

&gt;All participating remailers would post an "i'm here" message on it
&gt;periodically, say once every 24 hours. This message would include the 
&gt;remailers public key as well. My local software could scan this newsgroup.

As long as the key isn't trusted just because it was in the
newsgroup - this sounds workable.  Or, each remailer could have
a mailing list of addresses it sends the "i'm here" message to. 
Again, this gets the spooks no new information - if you use a
remailer even once, you have to assume that if some one was
watching closely enough, they *know* you used the system, and
they *know* your chosen destination received a message from the
system.  They just can't figure out who sent what to who.

&gt;at the idea solution, but there's got to be some way to create a remailer-net
&gt;that will allow my local software to generate long remailer chains to remailers
&gt;that are all still existent (now, if one of the remailers included in my

This seems backwards to me - I think what you want is local
software that is smart enough to figure out the state of the
remailer-net.  You needn't rip apart nor rebuild the whole net,
just write some code :)
