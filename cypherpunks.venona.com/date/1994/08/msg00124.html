&gt;&gt; &gt; Had it not been for the fact that having children covered with
&gt;&gt; &gt; scars, welts, and bruises is not considered child abuse in the

&gt;&gt; &gt; compound prior to the raid, and only the adults would have been
&gt;&gt; &gt; toasted.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Puh-leeze! There has been little to no evidence of ANY abuse of the 
&gt;&gt; Branch Davidian children. The only thing we know is that Koresh liked his 
&gt;&gt; mates young but that doesn't mean the rest of hte children were abused 
&gt;&gt; and, of course, Koresh's kink is quite normal in quite a few places. Are 
&gt;&gt; you forgetting that the BDs were investigated for child abuse and cleared 
&gt;&gt; earlier?
&gt;
&gt;These facts were well documented.  Child welfare workers visited the
&gt;compound and examined the children.  Signs of previous physical
&gt;punishment were noted as well as a room devoted to that purpose and
 ^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;the appropriate paraphernalia.

We were talking about physical ABUSE, not physical PUNISHMENT.  There is
a difference, unless of course you're one of those people that believe
that they're one in the same and that parents shouldn't be allowed to
physically discipline their children in any manner whatsoever.

When I was a child, we had a room devoted to the physical discipline of
us children: my parents bedroom.  And in that room, specifially the closet,
my father kept the appropriate paraphenalia: belts.  Do you believe my
parents should have been arrested for "child abuse"?  I don't.

The fact stands that there was no evidence that the children in the 
compound were ABUSED.  The Texas department of child welfare cleared 
Koresh of all such charges.  If you have any documentation to the
contrary, I would certainly be interested in seeing it.  I don't want
to see evidence of PUNISHMENT, only ABUSE.
