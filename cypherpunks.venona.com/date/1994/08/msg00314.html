Where you stand on this one depends on where you sit. ;-). It seems to me
that one could just as easily treat digicash as securities denominated in
dollars, just like shares in a money market mutual fund, or more to the
point, the actual money market instruments, repos, for instance. It's going
to take a sophistical titan to get this through the courts, but if there's
a market for digicash, hey, it can happen.  It won't happen if this titan's
employers never hear about it, though.

&gt;The second problem is the regulation of "scrip" and barter systems.  This
&gt;was pointed out on the list last year by someone who had actually been
&gt;involved in a private barter or scrip system which was shut down by the
&gt;government, at great cost to all concerned.  These regulations can be
&gt;found at 26 CFR 1.6045-1.  From subsection (f)(5)(ii), "Scrip is a token
&gt;issued by the barter exchange that is transferable from one member or
&gt;client, of the barter exchange to another member or client, or to the
&gt;barter exchange, in payment for property or services".  I think this one
&gt;will eventually get the "NetBank" people in trouble.  (You call a 900
&gt;number and in exchange for a charge on your phone bill they give you a
&gt;digital token you can exchange for property or services by participating
&gt;merchants.)  Barter exchanges are required to get the names and SS numbers
&gt;of all participants and report their transactions to the IRS.  This would
&gt;be inconsistent with the privacy we seek from ecash.

Indeed. This is probably where we have a problem.  The only thing I can
think of here is that the technology of the internet and it's limitless
opportunity for regulatory arbitrage.  When you make the possession of a
medium of exchange illegal you get the same problems that all closed
economies have.  With the internet, enforcement is half next to useless (an
expression I picked up in Albuquerque a while back...).  Like I said to
Eric in the last post, it may be the threat of regulatory arbitrage that
wins the day here, like it has in the past.

To plug the thread a bit here, who should chair the afternoon
business-heavy session? *Email* me your suggestions, please...

Cheers,
