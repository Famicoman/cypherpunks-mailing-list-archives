&gt; 2. Chobham, not Chobam. Chobham armor refers to a specific type of
&gt; layered armor, the precise composition and fabrication of which is
&gt; classified. It's named for the British works which first built it.
&gt; Reactive armor, such as is presently used by the Israelis and some
&gt; xUSSR units, is different; it consists of many small charges which
&gt; explode outward when hit by an incoming round.
&gt;
If your spelling is correct then several of my books have mis-spellings.

As to Chob(h)am bing classified, this was true till the late 80's. It is
a ceramic based layered with cintered metallics that dissipate the KE
of the incoming round.      

The Russians also developed this method for the T-72's at about the same
time. It was discovered that the 'applique' armor on the T-72 was really
this type of armor that could be bolted on. The reason that I lump the
two together is that they both require a dual warhead to defeat.

&gt; 2. Of the aircraft listed above, none can carry the 30mm round used by
&gt; the A-10. There is a 25mm round for the Bradley AFV chain gun;
&gt; presumably it can also be fired from the Apache. I don't know of a
&gt; 20mm DU round. (Of course, there's also a 120mm APDS round for the M-1
&gt; tank.)
&gt;
I have seen the exact same chain-gun mounted on F-16's and A-10's here at
Bergstron AFB in Austin at at least two different air shows. I am going on
this alone. I do not know if this was ever an active use of the gun.

&gt; &gt; I know of no ammo that uses anything other than brass or steel (in the 
&gt; &gt; case of mini-guns and other motor driven guns) for the case. The reason
&gt; &gt; that the Uranium is used is because of its high density. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3. It is interesting to note that US Army tanks are now being equipped
&gt; with depleted uranium _armor_ precisely because its density makes a
&gt; great backstop. DU armor can pretty much shrug off most medium AT
&gt; weapons; it is quite heavy, but that's not a problem for vehicles
&gt; which already weigh as much as tanks.
&gt; 
Could you provide references for this application? I did technical support
for Desert Storm and know of no use of such depleted armor in that campaign.
Has Chrysler started putting applique style blocks on the M1 Abhrams?

Take care.
