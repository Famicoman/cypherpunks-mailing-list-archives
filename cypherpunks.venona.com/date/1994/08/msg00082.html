&gt; First of all, what does this have to do with crypto..

Absolutely nothing.

&gt; Apparently this is your (presently unsubstantiated) opinion.  How about
&gt; some references that don't involve ATF employee testimonys?

I wasn't aware that child welfare workers and former Branch Davidians
were members of the ATF.

&gt; &gt;The Branch Davidians were proclaimed "cleared" of charges of child
&gt; &gt;abuse by Texas authorities in the presense of physical evidence which
&gt; &gt;would have been considered abuse in most other states.

&gt; In many places, spanking a child (with restraint and compassion, as a
&gt; parent) is considered child abuse, so I suppose this statement could be
&gt; considered true.

One mother reported that Koresh ordered her to spank her one year
old baby with a wooden paddle and wouldn't let her stop until the
child was bleeding.  This was because the child had cried while 
Koresh was giving a sermon.  I see no "restraint" or "compassion" here.

&gt; While I don't share the Davidians religious beliefs, I'd like to see more
&gt; evidence that the ATF was justified in their assault.

The ATF was completely unjustified in their assault.  That, of course,
does not refute any of the charges that the Branch Davidians were not
particularly nice to the younger members of their congregation.
