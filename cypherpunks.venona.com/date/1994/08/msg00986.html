&gt;     What follows is another Senate Bill, 2272, this one dealing with prior
&gt; rights and reexamination.  Thanks to Keith Stephens for sending it to me.

&gt;     It seems to give people who have used a device before it was patented
&gt; exemption from infringement.  Why a separate bill is needed for such rights
&gt; is puzzling, since anyone sued for infringement can prove such prior use in
&gt; public can therefore undermine the validity of the patent.  This could be part
&gt; of the first-to-file movement.  Any thoughts?
