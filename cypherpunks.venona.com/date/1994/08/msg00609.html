This was emailed to me and thought I'd pass it on.

-----------------

This is the initial posting from the Committee on Science, Space,
and Technology of the U.S. House of Representatives, chaired by the
Honorable George Brown of California.  We have agreed to serve as
the "beta" testers for House Committees trying to learn how to use
the Internet.  We posted this message to some of the USENET
newsgroups that discuss topics relevant to our jurisdiction over
Federal civilian research and development activities to:

     (1)  Increase the number of people who know we do have
          Internet access;
     (2)  Indicate how we can be reached on the net; and
     (3)  Start learning how to take advantage of this information
          system in our daily activities.

Getting the Congress to use Internet has been discussed in a few
threads on various USENET newsgroups of late.  Some of you may be
familiar with the E-Mail Pilot Project established by the Committee
on House Administration, chaired by the Honorable Charlie Rose of
North Carolina.  Those Members of the House currently maintaining
an electronic mailbox for constituent communications may be found
by e-mailing "congress@hr.house.gov" with the text "HELP" or "INFO"
in the message body.  You will receive an automated response with
the necessary instructions.

Also, the text of legislation introduced in the U.S. House of
Representatives during the current Congress is now available on a
W.A.I.S server located at the House Information Systems data
center.  The server may be accessed from the directory at
quake.think.com or using the following information:

     Server:        diamond
     Port:          210
     Database Name: USHOUSE_house_bill_text_103rd

It can also be found on gopher.house.gov in:

     Congressional Information/Legislative Resources

The database contains the text of House bills beginning with
October 1993 and is updated daily.

What follows now is the message you will automatically receive in
response to messages sent to housesst@hr.house.gov, the Committee's
Internet address.  It describes items like the Committee's gopher
server, which you can also find at gopher.house.gov.

                  ----------- begin -----------
     Welcome to the electronic mailbox system for the Committee on
Science, Space, and Technology of the U.S. House of
Representatives.  This Internet service is provided for ease of
communication with the Members and staff of the Committee.
     If your message is addressed to a specific Member, it will be
printed out in hard copy and forwarded to the Member's office for
response by U.S. Mail.
     If your message is addressed to a staff member of the
Committee, it will be forwarded electronically to that staff member
for response.   Depending on the nature of the response, it might
reach you in either electronic or postal form.
     Messages for the Committee press office will be acknowledged
electronically and then followed up on, if necessary, with material
by post or fax.  You can reach the press office directly via
Internet at "sstpress@hr.house.gov".
     The Committee also maintains a bulletin board on the House of
Representatives Internet gopher server at "gopher@hr.house.gov". 
Much of the public information material provided by the Committee
is available on this gopher system.
     Much of this information also is available on the Committee's
"Straight Talk" voice-response system.  Dial 202/225-3018 and
follow the menu instructions for a touch-tone telephone.
     Thank you for contacting the House Science Committee.  Please
be patient as we experiment with this new way of better serving
your communications needs.  If you wish to write to the Committee,
please direct your correspondence to:

           Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
               2320 Rayburn House Office Building
                  U.S. House of Representatives
                      Washington, DC  20515
                   ----------- end -----------

At this time, we suggest you supply both your e-mail and postal
addresses in any communication to the Committee.  Each office in
Congress has its own policy for responding to public inquiries. 
So, if we forward your e-mail to a particular Member's office, they
may choose to respond with a regular letter.  Our Committee hopes
to increase our use of e-mail in responding to public inquiries.

We have chosen the following subset of USENET groups for our
initial foray into the net.world:

alt.california
alt.cyberspace
alt.dcom.telecom
alt.politics.datahighway
comp.dcom.telecom
comp.org.cpsr.talk
comp.org.eff.talk
misc.education
misc.education.science
misc.legal
sci.agriculture
sci.astro
sci.bio.ecology
sci.chem
sci.energy
sci.engr
sci.environment
sci.geo.geology
sci.math
sci.med
sci.misc
sci.physics
sci.research
sci.space.policy
talk.environment
talk.politics.crypto

Please feel free to repost this message to other groups that might
find the information of value.  Your comments on what should be
carried by this channel of communications would also be welcomed.
