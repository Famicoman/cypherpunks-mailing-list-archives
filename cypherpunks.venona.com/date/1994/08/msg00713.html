&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am an agnostic.  I don't believe that 'they' exist.  I believe that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have a system staffed by a random selection of the American
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; population, somewhat skewed because people have some control over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what area they work in.  To work with a system, you need to understand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it objectively, you need something more than incantations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You've been pressing this point for some time.  I think the fundamental
&gt; &gt; &gt; flaw in your reasoning is that you are assuming the system to be the sum
&gt; &gt; &gt; of its parts.  That's not the case, though.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I said was : "to work with a system, you need to understand it
&gt; &gt; objectively".  Then your reply was : "the fundamental flaw in your
&gt; &gt; reasoning is ..."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I did not 'reason', I said that it was necessary to reason rather than
&gt; &gt; shout incantations.  You then proceed to reason, and I of course have
&gt; &gt; no objection to this:
&gt; 
&gt; Incantations!  Hocus-Pocus!  Eye of newt and head of toad!
&gt; 
&gt; I've been watching this for a bit (I lurk here a lot) and this discussion 
&gt; is really interesting.  I have some questions.  How are we going to 
&gt; understand the system objectively?  By objectively do you mean logically, 
&gt; mechanistically, magically?  Its clear you can't seperate yourself from 
&gt; "the system," even the "government system" as a member of this country.  
&gt; Sure, you can not vote, not participate, and try to observe it, but we're 
&gt; all part of those average americans that you point out make up the 
&gt; government.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In _Systemantics_, John Gall conducts a very interesting examination of
&gt; &gt; &gt; man-made systems and their behavior.  He notes that all man-made systems
&gt; &gt; &gt; exhibit certain traits, among them growth, encroachment and promulgation
&gt; &gt; &gt; of intra-system goals.  Your observation on the people employed by
&gt; &gt; &gt; government may be right on target, but it doesn't take into account the
&gt; &gt; &gt; entity of government itself.  This entity cannot be touched,
&gt; &gt; &gt; communicated with or coerced.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll have to check out this book-- it sounds very interesting.  I'm
&gt; bothered by the statement "all man-made systems." I find it hard to
&gt; believe that such generalizations can be made.  Is it all man made 
&gt; systems of a certain size?  Of Western philosophical culture?  Does my 
&gt; family exhibit these traits?  My circle of friends?  I must read this 
&gt; book myself to fully understand you point.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I more or less agree.  Now apply your arguments to this list as a
&gt; &gt; man-made system.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I should have read along a bit farther.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Put another way, even though every person within the system may be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; "good man", the system itself isn't necessarily good.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree.  But recall that I never spoke of goodness; I just said that
&gt; &gt; the people who work for the government are pretty much a random
&gt; &gt; assortment of Americans.  On the other hand, there have been several
&gt; &gt; heated statements to the effect that 'all lawyers are X' and 'all
&gt; &gt; government employees are Y'.  It is this that I disagree with the most.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Makes sense... you dislike generalizations based on occupation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure part of this is a cultural difference, given your .uk address.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The US Gov't probably looks better from outside than it does from
&gt; &gt; &gt; within.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [the rest filled with well stated personal opinions based on experience 
&gt; refuting the above statement]
&gt; 
&gt; So what do we do?  It seems we've pretty much agreed that governments are 
&gt; beasts beyond anyone's control, but so is _society_.  So is the entire 
&gt; human population.  Where do we start?  If, or based on the words of many 
&gt; on this list, we tear down the government, will we understand the 
&gt; resultant human-made system any better?
&gt; 
&gt; yes, lots of questions and little statement... now fill my head with 
&gt; enlightenment.
&gt; 
&gt; -john.
