&gt; &gt; Exactly what kind of democracy are you speaking of? Sounds like you are
&gt; &gt; lumping them all into one big bucket, 
&gt; 
&gt; I figure it's a reasonable summary of a lot of democracies right now.

What is a reasonable summary? Reasonable to who? What 'lot' of democracies?

&gt; &gt; If so, please be so kind as to demonstrate how a representative,
&gt; &gt; constitutional, and majority democracy are the same? And for the
&gt; &gt; record, we have a constitutional representative democracy.
&gt; 
&gt; Didn't say they were "the same".

No, but you certainly imply it with your broad brush.

&gt; But they do share a characteristic:
&gt; distortions of free market in the form of voting for theft and
&gt; redistribution of other peoples money leading to annoying government
&gt; micro-management, and general do-gooder busy-body-ness, and the many
&gt; laws on thought crimes.

Again, demostrate your assertion(s).

Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?

&gt; &gt; Personaly, I figure you must be one of those folks with a cognitive
&gt; &gt; disfunction. What part of "Congress shall make no law..." do you not 
&gt; &gt; understand?
&gt; 
&gt; I understand it, but US politicians either don't, or don't care and
&gt; largely ignore the constitution.  What does it matter whether I
&gt; understand it or not?

If you don't understand it you can't use it, effectively or otherwise.

&gt;  Your constitution says you can own and carry
&gt; guns; your politicians and law enforcement increasingly say that you
&gt; can not.  Your response to my saying that is that _I_ don't understand
&gt; the constitution?

No, my responce is prove your assertions. Explain to me why you believe
these are valid views and why they provide a more usable environment for
understanding what is going on then others.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The wild west was better than this state of affairs -- people didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the energy or inclination to waste their own resources being nosy
&gt; &gt; &gt; parkers, and those that did were apt to wind up full of lead.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Boy, you history is simply fucked. If you seriosly think the west was like
&gt; &gt; television you should spend more time reading books and period newspapers
&gt; &gt; and less time looking at the boob-tube. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't own a TV, and so don't watch much (by choice -- it's mostly
&gt; garbage); printed mass media is a bit better, but not that much.

Nice side step.

&gt; &gt; At the height of the range wars there were only 9 murders associated
&gt; &gt; with the conflict, not hundreds as the popular entertainment media
&gt; &gt; and spin-doctor culture would have you believe. Get your fucking
&gt; &gt; facts straight.
&gt; 
&gt; I know, that was my point; recall that I said the murder rate was low.

No, you said *nothing* about murder rate. What you did say was that back in
the old days people ran around killing those who bothered them. Which isn't
true either.

&gt; The point was there were way less laws, and few were telling their
&gt; neighbours what they could think.

Really? What was the law count say in 1865 versus 1965? 1897 v 1997?
Demonstrate your point.
