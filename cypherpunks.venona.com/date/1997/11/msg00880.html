The Virtual Girlfriend and Virtual Boyfriend are artificial
intelligence 
programs for your IBM PC or compatible and also for MACINTOSH. You 
can watch them, talk to them, ask them questions, tell them secrets, and 
relate with them.  Watch them as you ask them to take off different
clothes
and guide them through many different activities. Watch and participate
in
the hottest sexual activities available on computer, including: several
sexual positions, using many unique toys, even bringing in multiple
partners.
This is no doubt one of the most realistic, sexually stimulating
computer
games available. They will remember your name, birthday, your likes and
your
dislikes. Every time you start the program, they say different things,
and
act differently. Each time, they have a different personality. With the
VGA
digital graphics, The Virtual Girlfriend and Virtual Boyfriend software
have
some of the hottest, sexiest graphics out there.  And with a
Soundblaster or
compatible card, you can actually hear their voice as they talk to you.
This
is the first adult software title that was designed for both
heterosexual and
homosexual people. I would like you to try the actual full copy out
before it
is put on the market.  It will be sold for 1/5 of the actual price
($10.00)
until I can get back some information on what people think of the
program.  
Please give it a try and write back any comments.      Thank you.

    If you are interested and would like to order a copy, then you can
read
the mailing instructions below.  It comes in an unmarked package and is
sent
out at most 4 days after the order is received. You are not put on any
mailing lists whatsoever, guaranteed. It will run on any 386, 486 or
higher, 
and 100% IBM compatibles.  Required is VGA graphics, and a hard drive.  
The sound card is optional. Macintosh requires at least 4 meg of ram.  
Virtual Girlfriend and Virtual Boyfriend are artificial intelligence
programs, meaning they are completely interactive. It would be just like
if
you were talking to someone.  You can actually have simple
conversations.  
Their attitudes change with the different things you say, so you can say
things that will upset them, and then say things that will please them.
The
more you play/talk with them, the more you learn what they can do, and
what 
they like to do. It really is a blast.  With all these movies coming out
about virtual reality, it's amazing to actually have a virtual reality
program like this for your own computer. It's easy to install, and
instructions are easy
to follow.
