&gt;Some thoughts on the proposal floating around to require all electronic
&gt;transactions be identified and have IRS-endorse tags. I believe this runs
&gt;smack up against the First Amendment (and possibly the Fourth), and that
&gt;private transactions, contracts, IOUs, and such are essentially untaxable
&gt;and nonvisible to the government (practically speaking, a la the situation
&gt;today and at all times in the past).

Not to mention GATT and the WTO.  I don't think the US can unilaterally 
mandate a particular electronic commerce scheme and force it on electronic 
merchants in Mongolia (the freest trading country on earth these days).  

That's why when Pat said GATT would destroy U.S. soveriegnty, I said "I sure 
hope so."  

&gt;3. Many businesses have started asking for ID for more purchases (perhaps
&gt;because they think it will lessen liability problems, perhaps because they
&gt;just think that all customer-units should be tracked). An example: hotel
&gt;rooms. (Used to be one could just pay cash...now ID is demanded at some
&gt;hotels.) 

Though most hotels actually want credit cards and believe that credit cards 
are a form of ID even though they most certainly are not.

I was asked for a picture ID before being shown an apartment.  Real Estate 
agent concern about crime directed at them?

&gt;Some businesses are even demanding Social Security numbers. (And I
&gt;don't mean banks or other businesses with IRS reporting requirements...a
&gt;local gun range demanded my SS number for their range ID card.)

"I'm Canadian.  I don't have an SS#."  Works for everything that can be 
purchased or joined by Canadians in the US.

&gt;However, these ID requirements are not the norm, and most merchants will
&gt;happily take cash money for any and all purchases.

Very true.

&gt;4. "Receipts" are not even required by law for transactions. Alice and Bob
&gt;can complete a transaction without any paperwork. Or with handwritten
&gt;notes. Or a Xeroxed receipt form. Or with their Palm Pilots or Newtons, or
&gt;whatever.

The Finanzia Guardia (pardon my Italian spelling) (Financial Police) in Italy 
enforce the Italian requirement for receipts by fining customers who can't 
produce them.  Designed to back up VAT collection.  I noticed that most 
receipts there were generated by PCs under control of shopkeepers.  Good 
opportunities for keeping double books.  I wonder if Italy mandates POS and 
accounting software?

&gt;9. In the U.S. at least, there is essentially no attempt to collect sales
&gt;taxes on private, two-party transactions.  This is not enforceable at flea
&gt;markets, garage sales, and other such markets, let alone in private
&gt;transactions between Alice and Bob.

Though the New Jersey Gestapo *have* been attending computer, collector, etc. 
shows and demanding resale certificates, estimating revenue based on 
displayed stock, and seizing stock if not paid.  (Not recommended at gun 
shows -- which have been driven out of NJ in any case).  Hard work for the 
revenooers, though.

&gt;12. The expression "to utter a check" dates back before Eric Hughes' usage
&gt;a few years ago (so I was told by M. Froomkin). A check is a kind of
&gt;promise to pay.  So is an IOU. So is a promissory (sp?) note. So are many
&gt;kinds of contracts.

Uttering checks is from the dawn of commercial paper under common law.  I'm 
sure Eric read it in one of the banking books he likes to read.

&gt;Practically speaking, the idea is a non-starter. There are so many ways to
&gt;skirt the proposed ID systems, using cut-outs, off-shore accounts,
&gt;pseudonyms, etc., that enforcement would be a nightmare.

No kidding.
