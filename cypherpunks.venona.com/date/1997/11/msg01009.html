&gt;	NORTHWEST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FORUM
&gt;
&gt;WHEN:    Monday, November 17th, 1997. 
&gt;                No-host dinner: 5:30 - 6:30 p.m.
&gt;                Social hour: 6:00 - 7:00 p.m.
&gt;                Training: 7:00 - 8:30 p.m.
&gt;     
&gt;WHERE:	The College Club, 5th Avenue &amp; Madison Street, 
&gt;		in Seattle.  (Directions later in this notice.)
&gt;
&gt;TOPIC:		Data Mining and KDD: An Introductory Overview
&gt;
&gt;SPEAKER:  	Usama M. Fayyad, Ph.D., Microsoft Research
&gt;
&gt;COST:   	Public $10, NaiF members free. Complimentary parking
&gt;              	until 9 p.m. for all attendees in the College Club garage. 
&gt;
&gt;ABSTRACT
&gt;
&gt;Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining are concerned with
&gt;the extraction of high-level information (knowledge) from low-level data
&gt;(usually stored in large databases).  Dr. Fayyad will give an overview of
&gt;this rapidly growing area, define the goals, present motivation, and give a
&gt;high-level definition of the KDD Process and how it relates to Data Mining.
&gt;He will then focus on data mining methods.  These methods have their origins
&gt;in statistics, pattern recognition, learning, visualization, databases, and
&gt;parallel computing.  Basic coverage of a sampling of methods will be
&gt;provided to give a feel for what the methods are about and how they are
&gt;used.  
&gt;
&gt;He will outline the research challenges and opportunities posed by the
&gt;problem of extracting models from massive data sets (i.e., much larger than
&gt;main memory). Operating under such scalability constraints poses interesting
&gt;problems for how models can be built and what methods are practical.  He
&gt;will use an application in astronomy, done at JPL/Caltech, to motivate the
&gt;need for dealing with large databases, to illustrate problems of
&gt;classification and clustering with verylarge data sets, and to illustrate
&gt;how these techniques can offer powerful novel solutions to significant
&gt;problems.
&gt;
&gt;BIOGRAPHY
&gt;
&gt;Usama Fayyad is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research
&gt;(<A  HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/fayyad">http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/fayyad</A>)
&gt;&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/fayyad">http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/fayyad</A>)&gt; .  After receiving
&gt;the Ph.D. degree in 1991, he joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),
&gt;California Institute of Technology, until 1996.  At JPL, he headed the
&gt;Machine Learning Systems Group where he developed data mining systems for
&gt;automated science data analysis.  He remains affiliated with JPL as a
&gt;Distinguished Visiting Scientist.  Dr. Fayyad received the 1993 JPL Lew
&gt;Allen Award for Excellence in Research, and the 1994 NASA Exceptional
&gt;Achievement Medal.   
&gt;He was program co-chair of KDD-94 and KDD-95 (the First International
&gt;Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining).  He was general chair of
&gt;KDD-96, is editor-in-chief of the journal "Data Mining and Knowledge
&gt;Discovery," and co-editor of the new MIT Press book (1996) "Advances in
&gt;Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining."  His research interests include
&gt;knowledge discovery in large databases, data mining, machine learning,
&gt;statistical pattern recognition, and clustering.  
&gt;
&gt;DINNER &amp; AI
&gt;
&gt;NaiF members and non-members are invited to come early and order your own
&gt;dinner from the College Club's delicious and economical menu.  The College
&gt;Club offers free beer and some soft drink selections to Club members and
&gt;their guests (that includes all NaiF program participants) during their
&gt;happy hour" from 5 to 7 p.m.  Why not come directly from work (please arrive
&gt;by 5:30 p.m.) and join the NaiF Board, NaiF members and friends in a great
&gt;dinner before the evening program?  To aid in their planning, the College
&gt;Club requires a count of the NaiF dinner participants.
&gt;R.S.V.P. for the dinner only to Dave Ault (DAAult@Brigadoon.com
&gt;&lt;<A  HREF="mailto:DAAult@Brigadoon.com">mailto:DAAult@Brigadoon.com</A>&gt; , or 206-783-2917) by Noon on Wednesday,
&gt;November 12th, 1997.
&gt;
&gt;SOCIAL HOUR
&gt;
&gt;Come early (or join us after dinner) and network with other AI professionals
&gt;and enthusiasts during our social hour from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m.  NaiF provides
&gt;complimentary coffee and sodas during the social hour and program
&gt;presentation.
