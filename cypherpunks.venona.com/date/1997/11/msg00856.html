I'm sure you all saw this in the newspapers and on TV.  The media were on it
like...
like..., well, like media in pursuit of Democrats.

I don't know why I thought of &lt;one of above bunch&gt;

Re: Br'er Tim....

I was sure Bob's mother taught him better than to get into a pissing match
with the business end of a sewer.

Nicholson Calls On Assistant Army Secretary To Step Down
Lister Calls Marines "Dangerous," "Extremists"

     Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson today
called on Assistant Secretary of the Army Sara E. Lister to resign
her position, following a speech in which she referred to U.S.
Marines as "extremists," and "a little dangerous."

     "It's astonishing that Secretary Lister has chosen to
denigrate the Marine Corps, and it is absolutely unacceptable to
have a person with this kind of mindset in a position of power at
the Pentagon," Nicholson said.  "For the good of the morale of
America's Armed Forces, she should publicly apologize and resign
immediately."

     Lister, one of President Clinton's Pentagon appointees, told
a panel of academics and military personnel at Harvard
University's Olin Institute in Baltimore on October 26, that "The
Marines are extremists.  Wherever you have extremists, you've got
some risks of total disconnection with society.  And that's a
little dangerous."

     "These 'extremists' have fought and died for our country for
more than two centuries," Nicholson said, noting that the Marine
Corps celebrated its 222nd anniversary November 10.  "Service
secretaries are supposed to support our men and women in uniform,
not publicly degrade their valor.  Her remarks serve as evidence
of her ignorance about what it takes to assemble and maintain an
effective fighting unit."

     Nicholson, a retired Army colonel, Army Ranger in Vietnam and
West Point graduate, said Lister's comments are reflective of what
he called the Clinton Administration's anti-military attitude.
"Bill Clinton wrote that he 'loathed' the military and he's
apparently appointed people who share his anti-military view,"
Nicholson said.

     Rising tensions between the U.S. and Iraq also demonstrate
the need for effective military leadership.  "A person with such a
negative attitude toward the patriots who serve in uniform has no
business in any military organization," Nicholson said.  "With
this administration contemplating the use of military force in
response to Saddam Hussein's lawless arrogance, it is inexcusable
for the Assistant Secretary of the Army to insult the very men and
women who would be on the front lines."
