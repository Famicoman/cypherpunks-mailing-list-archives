I have just discovered that shouting "Fuck the FTC!" at the top of
your lungs a half-dozen times cures cancer.
Look for the details soon, on my website.

&gt; ******************************************
&gt; FTC Launches North American Health Claim Surf Day
&gt; ******************************************
&gt; 
&gt; by Michael Evers
&gt; 
&gt; The Federal Trade Commission recently joined with public health and
&gt; consumer  protection and information agencies from the United States,
&gt; Canada, and  Mexico to "surf" the Internet for potentially false or
&gt; deceptive  advertising claims concerning treatments or cures for heart
&gt; disease,  cancer, AIDS, diabetes, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.
&gt; 
&gt; The FTC announced today that in just a few hours during the recently
&gt; conducted North American Health Claim Surf Day, Internet surfers
&gt; identified more than 400 World Wide Web sites and numerous Usenet
&gt; newsgroups that contain promotions for products or services purporting
&gt; to help cure, treat or prevent these six diseases.
&gt; 
&gt; The FTC said that it sent hundreds of Web sites and newsgroups e-mail
&gt; messages pointing out that advertisers must have evidence to back up
&gt; their claims. FTC staff will follow-up by revisiting the targeted sites
&gt; in the coming weeks to determine if changes have been made. Suspected
&gt; violators received an e-mail warning which said the following:
&gt; 
&gt; The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), its federal and state law
&gt; enforcement  partners, and public health and consumer protection
&gt; agencies from Mexico  and Canada are sending you (and hundreds of other
&gt; Internet advertisers)  this message based upon a review of the promotion
&gt; you disseminated through  the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; The FTC and its partners have NOT determined whether your Internet
&gt; promotion violates United States federal or state laws, Mexican law, or
&gt; Canadian law. Nevertheless, we want to remind you that when you make
&gt; health claims in promoting a product, service, or treatment, those
&gt; claims  must be truthful and non-deceptive.
&gt; 
&gt; Deceptive Acts or Practices Are Unlawful under the FTC Act
&gt; 
&gt; In the United States, Section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. § 45),
&gt; prohibits  deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. In
&gt; addition, Section  12 of the Act (15 U.S.C. § 52) prohibits the
&gt; dissemination of any false  advertisement to induce the purchase of any
&gt; food, drugs, or devices.
&gt; 
&gt; An advertisement is misleading and deceptive if the advertiser makes an
&gt; objective claim, either expressly or by implication, including through
&gt; the  use of consumer testimonials, without a "reasonable basis" to
&gt; support that  claim. As set out in the Commission's Advertising
&gt; Substantiation Policy  Statement, advertisements that specify the level
&gt; of substantiation that the  advertiser possesses (e.g., "tests prove" or
&gt; "studies show") must be  supported by at least that level of evidence.
&gt; If the advertisement does not  specify a particular type of
&gt; substantiation, the Commission considers  several factors in determining
&gt; the appropriate level of substantiation.  Typically, claims of the sort
&gt; included on your Internet site must be  substantiated by competent and
&gt; reliable scientific evidence. Competent and  reliable scientific
&gt; evidence is defined as tests, analyses, research,  studies, or other
&gt; evidence based on the expertise of professionals in the  relevant area,
&gt; that has been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner  by persons
&gt; qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the
&gt; profession to yield accurate and reliable results. Anecdotal evidence
&gt; and  consumer testimonials are not considered competent and reliable
&gt; scientific  evidence. You may want to review your advertisement in light
&gt; of these  standards.
&gt; 
&gt; Possible Violations in Other Jurisdictions
&gt; 
&gt; Unfair or deceptive acts or practices are also unlawful under various
&gt; state  statutes in the United States. The standards under these statutes
&gt; may be  different from those of the FTC's. In addition, by placing an
&gt; Internet site  on the World Wide Web, you may be subject to scrutiny in
&gt; other countries  where you sell your products. You should be aware that
&gt; many countries,  including Mexico and Canada, also have laws that
&gt; generally require  advertisements to be truthful and non-deceptive.
&gt; 
&gt; "Hopeful and sometimes desperate consumers spend millions of dollars on
&gt; unproven, deceptively marketed, and often useless 'miracle cures' and
&gt; the  Internet should not become the newest medium for this age-old
&gt; problem,"  said Jodie Bernstein, Director of the FTC's Bureau of
&gt; Consumer Protection.  "In addition to wasting consumers' money, some
&gt; products or treatments may  even cause them serious harm or endanger
&gt; their lives. Even when the  advertised remedy is harmless, it can still
&gt; have a detrimental effect if it  causes consumers to stop or slow the
&gt; use of proven treatments."
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to today's effort to prevent health fraud, the FTC has
&gt; recently  conducted several other Internet Surf Days focusing on
&gt; different types of  fraud, including pyramid schemes and deceptive
&gt; business opportunity offers.
&gt; 
&gt; North American Health Claim Surf Day participants included:
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. Food and Drug Administration  Health Canada  Competition Bureau of
&gt; Industry Canada  Procuraduria Federal del Consumidor of Mexico  the
&gt; Secretaria de Salud of Mexico  Centers for Disease Control and
&gt; Prevention  Federal Communications Commission (Denver Office)  Attorney
&gt; General of Connecticut  Attorney General of Illinois  Attorney General
&gt; of Kentucky  Attorney General of Maryland  Attorney General of
&gt; Massachusetts  Attorney General of Minnesota  Attorney General of
&gt; Missouri  Attorney General of North Carolina  Attorney General of
&gt; Pennsylvania  Attorney General of Tennessee  Attorney General of Texas
&gt; Attorney General of Vermont  Attorney General of Virginia  Attorney
&gt; General of Wisconsin  Arthritis Foundation  American Heart Association
&gt; American Diabetes Association  Capital Area and Tristate AIDS Task
&gt; Force  Better Business Bureau serving northwest Ohio and southeast
&gt; Michigan.
