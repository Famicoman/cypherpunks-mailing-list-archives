&gt; &gt;&gt;         Not a damned thing. While in this country they are in the act of
&gt; &gt;&gt; committing a crime.

(Galt)
&gt; &gt;And who is it that gets to decide what is a "crime" and what is not?  

(Frieden)
&gt;         It would appear to me that an illegal in the country is as much in
&gt; the act of committing a crime as a burglar is while in a place other than
&gt; his own. 

I don't dispute this.  If a "crime" is defined as whatever the 
politicos/bureaucrats/hoodlums say it is, then a "crime" is certainly 
being committed.  (Of course there is another definition of crime.)


(Galt)
&gt; &gt;The 
&gt; &gt;politicos, the bureaucrats, the hoodlums in DC and elsewhere who think 
&gt; &gt;they have the right to run the lives of everybody else.

(Frieden)
&gt;         The politicians are responding to voters. The voters who are
&gt; pressuring them are siding with foreign nationals against the interests of
&gt; the United States which is presumed to be their new country of loyalty.

"If voting could change anything, it would have been outlawed long ago."  
Not strictly true.  But if I vote or don't vote...well it's just about 
the same difference as whether I buy a lottery ticket or not.

Don't vote - it only ENCOURAGES them!

&gt; That siding should be sufficient justification remove citizenship and
&gt; return them to the land of dysentary and mui Ninos. 

Citizenship, Schmitizenship.  Granted I don't want to renounce my 
citizenship - at least not at the moment.  But the whole game of riling 
up people's emotions about "citizenship" and "patriotism" is just a bread 
and circuses ruse to keep us focused on something other than what the 
professional control freaks are doing to us.


(Galt)
&gt; &gt;Again I ask the question:
&gt; &gt;What gives the hoodlums in Washington DC the right to draw a line on a 
&gt; &gt;map and control people's travel across that line?
&gt; 
&gt;         The people who made handgun ownership a felony gave them that right. 

The people who made handgun ownership a felony should be sent down a dark 
alley without any means of self-defense.  Perhaps they would gain a small 
glimmer of understanding of the real issues - unless they already 
understand that they are the hoodlums around the corner in the dark 
alley.  In that case....

&gt;         Lawmakers are resonsible for all foreseeable consequences not just
&gt; the intended consequences. 

Lawmakers can hardly be held responsible for tying their own shoes!  I 
suspect you had your satire mode on full when you wrote this.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -=-=-
&gt; The 2nd guarantees all the rest.
