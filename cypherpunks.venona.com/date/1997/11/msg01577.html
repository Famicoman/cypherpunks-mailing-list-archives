No thanks, Gary.  I'll avoid your added spam.

&gt; X-No-Archive: yes

Cute, Gary.  Hide the evidence, then challenge people later on to produce it.

&gt; Where's the proof that I accused him of abusing someone? You have none because

You're so sure that just because you hide all your posts behind that 
"X-No-Archive" header and had DejaNews remove all of your old posts from their 
archives that no one can hold you accountable for the numerous false charges
you've made in the past?  Maybe you can find a job cataloging video tapes of
campaigning fund-raising events for the White House.  Your selective memory
might be put to good use, there.  &lt;g&gt;

Perhaps you've conveniently forgotten about this accusation you posted:

&gt;  
&gt; So now the cowards in Ronald Francis's corner (I'm outright expecting the
&gt; culprit to be ronald francis himself) have taken to sending email to
&gt; those who have names listed on databasix's web page.  Sending comments to
&gt; a 17 year old that they're going to tell her mother that she's having an
&gt; affair with me.  Telling her mother that I'm molesting her daughter.
&gt; Having all sorts of fun.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Well OK Ronald Francis.  You win. You were right. It _IS_ ok to send a
&gt; list of names of those who annoy you to UCE sites causing those who annoy
&gt; you grief.  I see it a lot differently now. You were right.  BTW, as soon
&gt; as I find the connection between these posts, those from wazoo.com, those
&gt; from mailmasher.com and YOU ronnie, it'll all be reported to law inforcement.

In fact, just to really smear Ron, you posted the article twice.  The
second copy was identified as follows:

&gt; Message-ID:   &lt;gburnoreE5rxJ6.FFt@netcom.com&gt;

This allegation was based on a supposed anonymous message to an anonymous
"victim" at DataBasix, and people are supposed to believe that Ron Guilmette
was responsible for it despite that you've posted, to borrow your own words,
"not a shred of evidence".
