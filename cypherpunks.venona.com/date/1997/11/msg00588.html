Experts tell U.N. conference 'hate' sites on Internet may be here to
stay

Reuters

GENEVA (November 11, 1997 2:47 p.m. EST <A  HREF="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net</A>) -
Internet hate sites, such as one urging "Aryan brothers and sisters
... to combat racially inferior
parasites," are unlikely to be stamped out because this would limit
freedom of speech, experts said Tuesday.

The need to respect free speech, as well as the sheer size of the
task, emerged at a United Nations seminar as the two main obstacles
to eradicating such material.

The issue has become more pressing as the number of online hate sites
soars and racism, neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism, find new niches on
the Internet, speakers at the meeting said.

But there is no easy answer to the question: who decides what is
offensive on the Internet?

"In Europe, it would be racist to say, 'I don't like Arabs.' In the
United States, we can say 'I don't like Arabs, I don't like pink
people.' Under freedom of expression, it's not against the law," said
Debra Guzman, executive director of the U.S.-based Human Rights
Information Network.

"You can't ban this in the United States," she told a news
conference.

One problem is that Internet technology itself cannot distinguish
between the offensive and the non-offensive, said Eric Lee, public
policy director at the U.S. Commercial Internet Exchange.

        I have the honour to inform you that within the framework of the
     implementation of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to

     Assembly resolution 51/81, the High Commissioner for Human Rights will

     provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of all
     Forms of  Racial Discrimination".

        The purpose of the Seminar which will take place in Geneva from 10
     to 14 November 1997 and bring together experts on the subject matter,
     representatives of governments, Internet Service Providers, and
     representatives of non-governmental organizations, is to find ways and
     means to ensure a responsible use of the Internet in the light of the
     International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial
     Discrimination.


        The draft agenda of the meeting reads as follows:

                (a)     Racism and Racial Discrimination on Internet

        (b)     Technical Aspects of screening racist propaganda on
     Internet:
                1.      National Measures

     Aspects:
                1.      National Measures

        (d)     Elements for an eventual Code of Conduct and good practice
     for displaying material on Internet

                (e)     Recommendations.
