&gt; Subject: Free Market Anarchy (Beck's Folly) - Fundamental flaw
&gt; Date: Sat, 1 Nov 1997 19:20:20 -0600 (CST)

&gt; The fundamental flaw with the justification of a Free Market Anarchy and
&gt; also the fundamental condemnation of Democracy is that of taxation.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the theory of democracy does not in any way address the issues of
&gt; taxation, only how laws are made and what the boundaries on those laws are.
&gt; In fact, until about the first third of this century there was NO personal
&gt; taxation in this country at the federal level. Clear prima facia , and to use
&gt; Beck's verbage 'real', evidence that the assertion that personal taxation and
&gt; democracy are irrevocably wedded.
                                  ^
                                  is false.


&gt; Ask yourself, why is it that no free
&gt; market anarchist *ever* mentions commenality in humanity? Why do their have
&gt; inherent and implicit in their systems a class structure? They would have
&gt; you believe this is natural, it is not. Class structures are reflections of
&gt; the beliefs of the people, not some fundamental law of nature.
&gt; 
&gt; Furhermore, Free Market Anarchy does not address the issues of protection
&gt; from abuse. It does not recognize in any manner any mechanism for redress of
&gt; grievances unless you happen to be one of the few who controls the wealth.
&gt; It further assumes that those who don't have wealth will willingly take this
&gt; station in life as a given and simply work for those who do have wealth and
&gt; accept without resentment that they will forever be denied any sort of
&gt; opportunity to change their station in life except at the whim of the power
&gt; brokers. It further does not in any way address issues of life, liberty, or
&gt; pursuits of happines - only monetary wealth. It is clear that having wealth
&gt; does not in any manner guarantee any sort of empathy for others in the holder.
&gt; If anthing, history demonstrates that such 'lords of wealth' are pragmatic
&gt; about collecting wealth to the point of predation.
&gt; 
&gt; This argument from the specific to the general is fundamentaly flawed and
&gt; the conclusion suffers because of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. How that power is
&gt; obtained, by vote or specie, is irrelevant as clearly shown by history.
&gt; 
&gt; Some hold that the majority of the populace suffer taxation at the point of
&gt; a gun. This assertion is also false. There have historicaly been several
&gt; political parties which have promised to eliminate personal taxation. In
&gt; every case those parties could not control more than a truly minimal
&gt; percentage of the vote. Yes, people say taxation is too high, they do not
&gt; hold the assertion that taxes should be completely eliminated.
&gt; 
&gt; Free Market Anarchies are doomed to the same sort of death, and if ever
&gt; implimented the same sorts of abuse, as all other non-democratic systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, recognize that those who support such systems have a set of commen
&gt; character flaws. First, they can't differentiate the implimentation from the
&gt; theory of political systems. They would have you believe that if a given
&gt; implimentation of a system is flawed or broken than all systems of that ilk
&gt; are then broken or flawed. Clearly history does not support such assertions.
&gt; In short, they would throw the baby out with the bathwater. Secondly, these
&gt; in general are the sorts of people who find glee when they see a polic
&gt; officer run over in the street. Do you seriously believe that anyone this
&gt; cold and uncarring would not hesitate for an instant in putting pepper spray
&gt; in your eyes? Thirdly, they express a view which I call Theory X equality.
&gt; In short, as long as they are the ones making the profit, the fact that you
&gt; suffer for it, justly or not, is irrelevant and justified. In more prosaic
&gt; words, the ends *always* justifies the means. An assertion that history also
&gt; does not support.
