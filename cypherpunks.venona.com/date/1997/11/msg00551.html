Whew.. Well I hope we don't have to depend on the Supreme
Court for further privacy decisions.....

&gt;   
&gt;U.S. High Court Denies Strip-Search Appeal
&gt;
&gt;   By James Vicini
&gt;   
&gt;   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court let stand Monday a ruling
&gt;   that public school officials did not violate clearly established
&gt;   constitutional privacy rights by twice strip-searching two girls in
&gt;   the second grade.
&gt;   
&gt;   The justices left intact a U.S. appeals court ruling that the
&gt;   officials may be guilty of "questionable judgment," but could not be
&gt;   held liable for money damages for an unconstitutional search of the
&gt;   8-year-old girls.
&gt;   
&gt;   The case began May 1, 1992, when a teacher and a school counselor in
&gt;   Talladega, Ala., conducted the strip-searches after a classmate
&gt;   reported $7 missing from her purse.
&gt;   
&gt;   Another classmate accused one of the girls, Cassandra Jenkins, of
&gt;   stealing the money and putting it in the backpack of the other girl,
&gt;   Oneika McKenzie. No money was found in the backpack.
&gt;   
&gt;   The two girls were taken to a restroom and told by music teacher
&gt;   Susannah Herring to remove their clothes. They were told to come out
&gt;   of the toilet stalls with their underpants down to their ankles, which
&gt;   they did.
&gt;   
&gt;   No money was found on the girls or in their clothing. After a trip to
&gt;   the principal's office, the girls were taken by Herring and guidance
&gt;   counselor Melba Simon back to the restroom for another, unsuccessful
&gt;   strip-search.
&gt;   
&gt;   The parents of the two girls sued for damages under the civil rights
&gt;   laws, alleging violations of their constitutional right to be free
&gt;   from unreasonable searches.
&gt;   
&gt;   A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit. A divided appeals court in
&gt;   June upheld the decision, ruling that the teacher and counselor enjoyed
&gt;   partial immunity from the constitutional claim.
&gt;   
&gt;   The appeals court said that in 1992 the law involving searches of
&gt;   students at school had not been sufficiently developed to place the
&gt;   educators on notice that their conduct was constitutionally
&gt;   impermissible.
&gt;   
&gt;   The Supreme Court in a 1985 ruling gave school administrators greater
&gt;   flexibility to search students, but said they still have a legitimate
&gt;   right to privacy and added that the search cannot be "excessively
&gt;   intrusive."
&gt;   
&gt;   Attorneys for the two girls appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing
&gt;   that the appeals court decision conflicted with the 1985 precedent.
&gt;   They said the appeals court decision sent the wrong message to
&gt;   "school officials nationwide."
&gt;   
&gt;   They said school authorities may strip-search students to prevent
&gt;   imminent danger from the possession of weapons or illegal drugs, but
&gt;   they may not use intrusive searches for "the most minor suspected
&gt;   infractions."
&gt;   
&gt;   The attorneys said Supreme Court guidance was urgently needed on the
&gt;   extent of constitutional constraints on strip-searches in schools.
&gt;   
&gt;   Attorneys for the teacher and the counselor urged that the appeal be
&gt;   denied, saying the appeals court correctly decided the case. The
&gt;   Supreme Court turned down the appeal without any comment or dissent.
&gt;    

"THE BILL OF RIGHTS: Void where prohibited by law."
