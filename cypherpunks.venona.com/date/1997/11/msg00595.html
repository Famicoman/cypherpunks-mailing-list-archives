&gt; &gt;A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied
&gt; &gt;First Amendment protection to ``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for
&gt; &gt;Independent Contractors,'' saying publisher Paladin Press knew it
&gt; &gt;would be used by murderers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The book was sold to James Edward Perry, who was convicted of killing
&gt; &gt;Mildred Horn; her disabled 8-year-old son, Trevor; and the son's
&gt; &gt;nurse, Janice Saunders, in Silver Spring, Md., in 1993. The women were
&gt; &gt;shot between the eyes and the boy's respirator was unplugged.
 
&gt; Having skimmed the "Hit Man" book, I can tell you it conveyed no unique
&gt; information about how to shoot someone between the eyes and unplug a
&gt; respirator.

If I recall correctly, it suggests the back of the neck/head as the 
Miss Murderer proper point of entry for small projectiles.

The instructions on how to build a silencer were very useful, but
neglected to mention that being smart enough to follow the instructions
didn't necessarily mean you were smart enough to use it properly.
A word of advice...if you forget to take the steel rod used to align
the silencer out of the barrel before you use it, it stings like a
bitch when you shoot.
 
&gt; If this Paladin case is not overturned, it will mean the "death through
&gt; lawsuits" of nearly all publishers of even slightly controversial material.
&gt; Loompanics will go, Delta Press will go, etc. "Unintended Consequences"
&gt; will be withdrawn by the publisher and the author will be sued. "The Turner
&gt; Diaries" will become a contraband item.

I wonder if any kids reading the Bible have murdered big guys by using
a slingshot? Sounds like a case for censorship, to me.
 
&gt; And why not sue other publishers and bookstores? Maybe a book on abortions
&gt; helped a woman perform an illegal abortion. Maybe a book about fighting for
&gt; liberty provided "abstract advocacy speech so explicit in its palpable
&gt; entreaties to violent crime" (and so it is unprotected, according to the
&gt; courts).

Perhaps the British could launch a class-action suit against the author
of the Star-Spangled Banner, and have it banned. They could use Jimi
Hendrix's Woodstock version to work the jury into an emotional frenzy
against it as an anthem for drug-addicted freaks.

&gt; But in many ways, this is good news. The war is coming faster than I thought.

 &lt;muffled explosions in the background&gt;
 
&gt; The judge in this case has committed a capital crime.

Better have our fearless leader, Jim Bell, convene a Melatonin People's
Court, immediately. (The rest of you guys signed and returned the 
'secret oath' that Jim sent last week, too, didn't you?)
