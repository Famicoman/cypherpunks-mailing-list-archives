&gt; &gt;What language did you have in mind?  modula-3?  iso-pascal/borland
&gt; &gt;pascal?
&gt; 
&gt; Hadn't thought of Modula-3, but that is an excellent idea.  Java would
&gt; be a candidate, although performance is an issue.  

Java isn't so bad.  Just in time compilers are being shipped with some
browsers (netscape on some platforms).  Sun now has native bigint
library (good for you know what, and exportable because they haven't
included the few lines required to implement public key encryption
with it).

Modula-3 is also fairly clean... garbage collection, bounds checked
arrays, etc.  A `safe' language.  There is indeed a m3 -&gt; c
translator.  I think GNU were working on a m3 module for their
retargetable gcc compiler suite (to go with ada, C, fortran, pascal).
I did hear talk of a java gcc front end also.

&gt; While it may seem crazy to toss compatibility, it has some advantages.
&gt; For instance, the only people who will use it are the hardcore types.
&gt; I like the idea of an exclusive crypto system that only cool people
&gt; who are fairly with it use.

I think there would be advantages to always tunneling the encrypted
messages inside PGP, that way no snoops know you're using it, until
it's too late.

&gt; How about finding a way to eliminate indicators?  It's nice not to
&gt; leak any information at all.  It also makes super-encryption stronger.
&gt; If each encrypted layer looks like noise, the total key size is the
&gt; sum of the bits of each layer.

That's a reasonable idea if you're going to use things like IDEA( k1,
3DES( k2, data ) ).

&gt; If the protocol doesn't accept multiple keys for a message it is
&gt; slightly CAK/GAK resistent.  And, it's a nice statement of intent.
&gt; It's also nice to have tools which help you to behave securely without
&gt; carefully thinking about it when you are using them.

Forward secrecy is what you want for GAK resistance -- can't get much
more GAK hostile than burning your keys seconds after message receipt.

&gt; The randseed.bin file has always bothered me.  What we really want is
&gt; some good sources of entropy in which we have tremendous confidence.

What's wrong with the randseed.bin and the public and private key
rings is that they should all be encrypted with a key derived from
your passphrase.

&gt; &gt;If you use PGP's random pool, one suspects that if IDEA becomes
&gt; &gt;attackable at some point in the future the random pool will start to
&gt; &gt;look more like a predictable PRNG to the attacker.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I wonder how good linux's /dev/urandom would be if MD5 becomes even
&gt; &gt;more suspect.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, neither of these would be good for a one time pad, of course.

Linux's /dev/random might not be bad.  There is some real entropy in
key strokes and mouse movements, and they are quite conservative about
entropy estimation.  You can easily make it more conservative -- XOR
together a load of it to derive a smaller key.

&gt; It would be neat to have, say, three sources of hardware randomness
&gt; and then XOR the result with the above pseudo random output.

That'd be fine.  Personally not being a hardware type, I am suspicious
of hardware RNGs.. I can't tell when they are going wrong.. failure
modes can be dangerous (whoops lead fell of geiger tube), etc.
Software and computers are easier to understand.  Provided you XOR the
lot together you should be fine though.

&gt; You know, it would be cool to define a software architecture for
&gt; remailer software.  Different remailers have different properties and
&gt; different strategies.  They may continue to differentiate.

One thing that is sorely needed in my opinion is a simple way to
integrate with existing mailers.  Ie to have some code which acts as
an interface between various extensible email based functions
(remailers, signatures, DC nets, keyservers) and MUAs.  Then someone
gets to fight with the plugin API once, and after that we can
automatically add features which work with lots of MUAs.

The future is in extensibility.  Java is pretty good for this.
