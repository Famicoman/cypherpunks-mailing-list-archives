&gt; &gt; I'm beginning to doubt if anyone participating in this thread knows
&gt; &gt; what the fuck racism even is...or what humor is, either, for that
&gt; &gt; matter.
&gt; &gt;   Racism is a bunch of idiots who think that pissing on someone who
&gt; &gt; _may_ be of a differnet ethinic origin, in a pissing contest, is racism.
 
&gt; No.  Using ethnic characteristics as a criteria for attaching
&gt; emotional labels is racism.  

  Double-No! It is a damn fine way of pissing in someone's boot when
that is your purpose, and it is really nobody's business but the
pisser and the pissee (not even those who wear the same brand of
boots).
  Why didn't Eddie Murphy say, "I'm your worst nightmare...a Black-Afro
American with a gun!"? Could it be that the character he was playing
was the type of person who recognized the difference between a tea
party and a bar fight?
  (Kent, are you the one sending anonyous emails to whitehouse.gov
   saying, "Throw rocks at DC!"?)

&gt; Of course, I grant you that on a mailing list it isn't possible to
&gt; know whether the human Tim May is "really" a racist, so it would have
&gt; been more accurate to say that the persona "Tim" on this mailing list
&gt; is clearly racist.  However, the usage is common.  And also granted
&gt; that the overwhelming thrust of Tim's writings are negative, so his
&gt; racist comments are almost lost in the noise.

  Thanks for clearing that up. It would be a shame to 'inaccurately'
flame someone on this list. It takes longer to fill their boots up
if you are not quite on the mark.

&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   Well, when a spic, nigger, wop, kike, raghead, slant or wagon burner
&gt; &gt; is broken down on the side of the road on a dark and stormy night, I'm
&gt; &gt; the fucking one out there getting cold and wet helping them out, while
&gt; &gt; all of the politically correct types lock their doors while driving
&gt; &gt; by at 60 mph.
&gt; 
&gt; And Tim would be right beside you, helping out.  Right...

  Sure, if they were headed 'out of town' instead of 'toward' town...

  Really, Kent, you surely can't have lived such a cloistered life that
you judge everything in life by the words and images cast upon the 
Silver Screen of alleged reality.
  In my younger days I used to get picked up by dirt-farmers while
hitchiking, and be subjected to a predictable lecture about long
hair, hippies all ought to get a job, kids today...blah, blah.
Most of the time, before dropping me off, the farmer would dig
a few bucks out of his pocket and offer it to me, saying, "Have
you eaten today? Here, take this."

&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt;   I've smoked crack with blacks, niggers and black-afro americans. When
&gt; &gt; I talk loud enough for them to hear me, I try to be courteous enough to
&gt; &gt; fit my choice of words to the environment and/or their preference.
 
&gt; courtesy = censorship

Courtesy = free choice of words = honest self-censorship
Politcially Correct Politeness = Mandatory/voluntary self-censorship

NEWS FLASH!!!
  Once you grow up and move away from home, then many things that were
formerly mandatory (or else!) become voluntary. People who were easy
to toilet train often go through life thinking that they are 'good'
people just because they still haven't figured out that they have
a 'choice' of how to speak, act, behave.  
  I'll take a good old redneck who has learned not to 'hate niggers'
as much as he used to, over an anal retentive batik artist who 
still hasn't figured out that he clenches his teeth when he speaks
of the 'Black-Afro American' who robbed and pistol-whipped him.

  When Adam Back agrees with me, he's British. When he disagrees with
me, he's a fucking Limey. (And it doesn't matter a shit whether he
is white, black, yellow or green.)

  The best way to eliminate racism is to hire a racist, go to dinner
with a racist, talk with a racist--not to sit drinking cafe latte 
with your friends while denouncing racism.
  I find it hard to believe that the slants and the round-eyes on
this list think that apparent differences in the backgrounds and
beliefs of list members deserves more discussion than the loss of
our common freedoms, just because some Anonymous shit-disturber
(who may also be Nonookie Masturbatshi, for all we know) wants
to impress Bob Hettinga in the hopes of being able to put his
dick in A Body Orfice To Be Named Later at some point in the
future (or already has, at some point in the past).

  In the course of pursuing things which are important in our life
(such as producing the Nutly News), we will be much more productive
if we refrain from joining in mouth-jerk reactions to the worms
that get dangled in front of us by the anonymous entities posting
from the boat above us.

  And the way this relates to crypto is...NONE OF YOUR FUCKING
BUSINESS! (&lt;--- Topically Incorrect)
