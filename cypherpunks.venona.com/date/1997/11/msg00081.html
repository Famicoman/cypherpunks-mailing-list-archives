&gt;&gt;The Klinton Klan has already effectively banned imported SKS ammo
&gt;&gt;(7.62x29, as I recall, given that I don't have any rifles
&gt;&gt;chambering this popular round).
&gt;&gt; ---
&gt;&gt;Before you rush to correct me, I _meant_ to write "7.62x39" of
&gt;&gt;course.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;(A round used by the Chinese, Soviet, and East Bloc nations, and
&gt;&gt;roughly equivalent to the American M-16 round, known either as the
&gt;&gt;.223 or 5.56mm. The NATO "7.62" is in a longer case length.
&gt;&gt;7.62x54, as I recall. Known in America as .308.
&gt;
&gt; If I remember right they were able to do this because the only ammo
&gt;available for 7.62x39  is from the Chinese and uses steel core
&gt;projectiles not lead. Then when Olympic Arms came out with the cutdown
&gt;weapon chambered for 7.62x39 it was able to be banned uder a
&gt;regualtion banning "armor piercing ammo that could be used in a
&gt;handgun."

Vinnie M. sent me a note also saying this. I guess the Eastern European
stuff is available--for now.

Some in the gun community are vilifying Olyarms for introducing this OA-93
"assault pistol" (the name often applied to politically incorrect pistols
like this). As if Olyarms should have been cowed into not introducing a
product out of fear that Clinton would abuse his authority to ban Chinese
ammo.

&gt;   One thing though,  7.62x39 really could not be compared to the 5.56
&gt;NATO, its really more potent out to 2-300 meters; it is still a .30
&gt;cal vs 5.56 NATOs .223,  but its far less potent than 7.62 NATO
&gt;(7.62x54). The 7.62x39 was the standard caliber of ComBloc weapons for
&gt;several decades, most specifically the AK-47, AKM-44 (sniper weapon),
&gt;and SKS carbine. I think the Dragunov sniper system used a more potent
&gt;cartridge.

I've never owned anything in 7.62x39. I hear the SKS rifles are pretty good
for $150, or whatever, and a lot of people have bought them. To me they
look a little crude. And since I can afford things out of the AR-15 line....

(Debate rages in rec.guns and elsewhere about the relative merits of the
cartridges. I certainly see more variants of the AR-15 here in America,
more use by tactical and law enforcement teams, and more accessories. But
maybe I'm not looking in the right places.)

One of the more interesting images I ever saw was a photo in one of the gun
mags of a friendly meeting in the U.S. between Eugene Stoner, principal
designer of the AR-15 (the M-16 in its military version) and Mikhail
Kalashnikov, whose name needs no further explanation.

I suppose tree-hugging peaceniks would be aghast at a meeting between these
two merchants of death. I, being an antigovernment type, was nevertheless
impressed.
