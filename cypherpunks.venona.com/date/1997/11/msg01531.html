I would like to inform you about a new, and exciting award winning
product that will save you both countless hours, and increase
your exposure on the Internet immeasurably! Known as the
Submission Wizard our program offers web users such as
yourself, the ability to automatically submit your site to

The submission process is very simple, efficient, and most
importantly fast. All you do is provide standard site

required by each different engine, then registers your
web site. It's that simple!

In addition, the Wizard's database of search engines and
directories is constantly being updated every week,
thus giving your site fresh and relevant exposure. Also
