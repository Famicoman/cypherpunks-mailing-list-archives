If you have not read the following post, do so.
It reflects the view of everyone I have spoken to who has even
the remotest knowledge of explosives and demolition.

Regardless, I am getting sick and tired of hearing the whining
'theories' of the 'experts' in regard to the OKC bombing.

A Challenge: If every naysayer/conspiracy theorist whose diatribes
  I have read (a small percentage of the total number) would kick
  in a couple of bucks, then there would be funds available to
  build a truck-bomb corresponding to the alleged OKC bomb, and
  to recreate the alleged crime with an abandoned building that
  can be found to provide a similar physical target.
  We're talking about a few grand, here. Put up or shut up. Anyone
  who cares to take on the challenge can cover that on T-shirt
  sales alone.
  If the re-enactment shows the truck bomb to have been a provably
  false scenario, it would be interesting to see a second display
  with BATF actors putting explosive charges in the middle of the
  building. (And then we can crash a Mercedes into the underground
  concrete pillars in Paris, to guage the results.)

&gt; 
&gt; I disagree.
&gt; 
&gt; The US Goverment and the mainstream media were both guilty
&gt; of either ignorance or deliberate subreption during McVeigh's
&gt; trial.  As a military trained explosive demolition instructor,
&gt; I am compelled to concur with the absent testimony and published
&gt; findings of a certain three star, to wit:
&gt; It ain't necessarily so.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of explosives will tell you
&gt; that two tons of ammonium nitrate, sixty feet from the base
&gt; of a tall, reinforced concrete and steel building, will not do 
&gt; very much more than break lots of windows.  You see, ammonium 
&gt; nitrate is a low velocity explosive compound useful for moving 
&gt; dirt.  A brissance, or shattering effect, on steel and/or 
&gt; reinforced concrete requires an explosive compound with much 
&gt; greater explosive velocity.... C-4, several types of commercial
&gt; blasting gelatin, even TNT.
&gt; 
&gt; If you observed the news footage of the Murray Federal Building 
&gt; after the blast, you may have noticed that the damage was 
&gt; configured in a semi-cylindrical fashion, rather than the conic 
&gt; section which would have resulted from a ground placed charge of 
&gt; sufficient strength.  You might also have wondered about the 
&gt; apparent lack of a crater at the site of the explosion...
&gt; (The crater was mysteriously relocated to the basement of the 
&gt; structure, probably by A Terrorist-Provocateur To Be Named Later...)
&gt; 
&gt; If you looked closely at the ruined building, you would have seen
&gt; evidence of brissance on alternating bearing members on each floor.
&gt; (I have photos of this)
&gt; 
&gt; Had detailed chemical analysis of the site been permitted, evidence 
&gt; of a very large and elaborate line or ring main constructed of 
&gt; detonation cord, of the RDX or PETN based military variety, likely, 
&gt; would have been found.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider that the placement of the array of charges necessary to
&gt; simultaneously shatter several dozen large bearing members in the
&gt; building would have required several hours for a well trained
&gt; demolition team, not to mention unlimited access to the building 
&gt; after hours.
&gt; 
&gt; Seismographs recorded TWO impacts that day, several minutes apart.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider that if this action was meant to revenge or commemorate the 
&gt; Waco massacre, it achieved the opposite goal.  However, if this was 
&gt; the work of agents-provocateur, it worked beautifully.  Waco was 
&gt; downplayed in the face of 'the threat of domestic terrorism.'  The 
&gt; body count was higher, and this time it came from the 'self-styled 
&gt; militia.'
&gt; Also, if McVeigh really had followed the Turner Diaries recipe, he 
&gt; would have put his bomb somewhere useful.  The book details the use 
&gt; of a similar device to destroy a large government database, and the 
&gt; truck bomb is parked underneath it
&gt; in the basement parking structure, _not_ sixty feet away...
&gt; 
&gt; The reader's digest version:
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  McVeigh's bomb, as it was and where it was, was a squirt of 
&gt; piss in a hurricane.
&gt; 
&gt; 2)  A well financed team of demolition professionals did the job.
&gt; 
&gt; 3)  The payoff from this "investment" was the impressive Anti-Terrorism 
&gt; bill, much political mileage for the agency "targeted" by the attack, 
&gt; and an option for more legislation in the crypto arena.
&gt; 
&gt; 4)  In a perfect world, McVeigh would have been prosecuted for 
&gt; incompetence, and given a suspended sentence because he was, after 
&gt; all, merely an infantry sergeant, not a demolition pro.  In the 
&gt; same perfect world, Woodward and Bernstein types would follow up 
&gt; on stuff like this instead of gulping down regurgitated propaganda 
&gt; like so many infant birds.  Then perhaps the true terrorists would 
&gt; be punished, and the political agenda of their employers exposed.
&gt; 
&gt; 5)  The convenient deaths of poor defenseless children(TM) contributed 
&gt; mostly to the policy goals of the jackbooted thugs, not to those of 
&gt; their detractors.
&gt; 
&gt; 6)  McVeigh pulled an Oswald.  Quit crediting him with success.
