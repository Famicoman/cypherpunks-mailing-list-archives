&gt;Subject:  Call for Papers - 3rd USENIX Electronic Commerce Workshop
&gt;Apparently-To: &lt;treese@openmarket.com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear Colleagues,
&gt;
&gt;Electronic Commerce is a rapidly growing area with global economic
&gt;implications.  I'm excited to be able to say that we're putting
&gt;together the Third USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce, and I
&gt;invite your participation.  This vital inter-disciplinary field
&gt;thrives from a cross pollenation of ideas and techniques from many
&gt;areas, and this workshop will be a great opportunity for you to
&gt;present your findings as well as learn about other latest results.
&gt;
&gt;So, mark your calendars!  The workshop will take place from August 31
&gt;to September 3, 1998, and paper submissions are due by March 6, 1998.
&gt;I hope to see you in Boston!
&gt;
&gt;Bennet Yee
&gt;Program Chair

&gt;
&gt;OVERVIEW
&gt;
&gt;The Third Workshop on Electronic Commerce will provide a major
&gt;opportunity for researchers, experimenters, and practitioners in
&gt;this rapidly self-defining field to exchange ideas and present the
&gt;results of their work. It will set the technical agenda for work in
&gt;electronic commerce by enabling workers to examine urgent
&gt;questions, share their insights and discover connections with other
&gt;work that might otherwise go unnoticed. To facilitate this, the
&gt;conference will not be limited to technical problems and solutions,
&gt;but will also consider their context: the economic and regulatory
&gt;forces that influence the engineering choices we make, and the
&gt;social and economic impact of network based trading systems.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;TUTORIALS PROPOSALS WELCOME
&gt;
&gt;One day of tutorials will precede the Workshop on August 31.
&gt;USENIX's well-respected tutorials are intensive and provide
&gt;immediately-useful information delivered by skilled instructors who
&gt;are hands-on experts in their topic areas. Topics for the
&gt;Electronic Commerce Workshop will include, but are not limited to,
&gt;security and cryptography. If you are interested in presenting a
&gt;tutorial, please contact:
&gt;
&gt;Dan Klein, Coordinator
&gt;Email: dvk@usenix.org
&gt;Phone: 412.421.2332
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;WORKSHOP TOPICS
&gt;
&gt;Two and one-half days of technical sessions will follow the
&gt;tutorials. We welcome submissions for technical and position paper
&gt;presentations, reports of work-in-progress, technology debates, and
&gt;identification of new open problems. Birds-of-a-Feather sessions in
&gt;the evenings and a keynote speaker will round out the program.
&gt;
&gt;We seek papers that address a wide range of issues and ongoing
&gt;developments, including, but not limited to:
&gt;
&gt;Advertising
&gt;Anonymous transactions
&gt;Auditability
&gt;Business issues
&gt;Copy protection
&gt;Credit/Debit/Cash models
&gt;Cryptographic security
&gt;Customer service
&gt;Digital money
&gt;EDI
&gt;Electronic libraries
&gt;Electronic wallets
&gt;Email-enabled business
&gt;Exception handling
&gt;Identity verification
&gt;Internet direct marketing
&gt;Internet/WWW integration
&gt;Key management
&gt;Legal and policy issues
&gt;Micro-transactions
&gt;Negotiations
&gt;Privacy
&gt;Proposed systems
&gt;Protocols
&gt;Reliability
&gt;Reports on existing systems
&gt;Rights management
&gt;Service guarantees
&gt;Services vs. digital goods
&gt;Settlement
&gt;Smart-cards
&gt;
&gt;Questions regarding a topic's relevance to the workshop may be
&gt;addressed to the program chair via electronic mail to
&gt;ec98chair@usenix.org. USENIX will publish Conference Proceedings
&gt;which are provided free to technical session attendees; additional
&gt;copies will be available for purchase from USENIX.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;WHAT TO SUBMIT
&gt;
&gt;Technical paper submissions and proposals for panels must be
&gt;received by March 6, 1998. We welcome submissions of the following
&gt;type:
&gt;
&gt;1. Refereed Papers - Full papers or extended abstracts should be five
&gt;   to 20 pages, not counting references and figures.
&gt;
&gt;2. Panel proposals - Proposals should be three to seven pages,
&gt;   together with a list of names of potential panelists. If
&gt;   accepted, the proposer must secure the participation of
&gt;   panelists, and prepare a three to seven page summary of panel
&gt;   issues for inclusion in the Proceedings. This summary can
&gt;   include position statements by panel participants.
&gt;
&gt;3. Work-In-Progress Reports - Short, pithy, and fun, WIP reports
&gt;   introduce interesting new or ongoing work and should be 1 to 3
&gt;   pages in length. If you have work you would like to share or a
&gt;   cool idea that is not quite ready to publish, a WIP is for you!
&gt;   We are particularly interested in presenting student work.
&gt;
&gt;Each submission must include a cover letter stating the paper title
&gt;and authors, along with the name of the person who will act as the
&gt;contact to the program committee. Please include a surface mail
&gt;address, daytime and evening phone number, email and fax numbers
&gt;and, if available, a URL for each author. If all of the authors are
&gt;students, please indicate that in the cover letter for award
&gt;consideration (see "Awards" below).
&gt;
&gt;USENIX workshops, like most conferences and journals, require that
&gt;papers not be submitted simultaneously to more than one conference
&gt;or publication and that submitted papers not be previously or
&gt;subsequently published elsewhere. Submissions accompanied by
&gt;non-disclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be
&gt;returned to the author(s) unread. All submissions are held in the
&gt;highest confidentiality prior to publication in the Proceedings,
&gt;both as a matter of policy and in accord with the U.S. Copyright
&gt;Act of 1976.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;WHERE TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS
&gt;
&gt;Please send submissions to the program committee via one of the
&gt;following methods. All submissions will be acknowledged.
&gt;
&gt;Preferred Method: email (Postscript or PDF formats only) to:
&gt;ec98papers@usenix.org.
&gt;
&gt;Files should be encoded for transport with uuencode or MIME base64
&gt;encoding.  Authors should ensure that the PostScript is generic and
&gt;portable so that their papers will print on a broad range of
&gt;postscript printers, and should submit in sufficient time to allow
&gt;us to contact the author about alternative delivery mechanisms in
&gt;the event of network or other failure. If you send PostScript,
&gt;remember the following:
&gt;
&gt;1) Use only the most basic fonts (TimesRoman, Helvetica, Courier).
&gt;   Other fonts are not available with every printer or previewer.
&gt;
&gt;2) PostScript that requires some special prolog to be loaded into
&gt;   the printer won't work for us. Please don't send it.
&gt;
&gt;3) If you use a PC- or Macintosh-based word processor to generate
&gt;   your PostScript, print it on a generic PostScript printer before
&gt;   sending it, to make absolutely sure that the PostScript is
&gt;   portable.
&gt;
&gt;4) If you are generating the PostScript from a program running
&gt;   under Windows, make sure that you establish the "portable"
&gt;   setting, not the "speed" setting for PostScript generation.
&gt;
&gt;A good heuristic is to make sure that recent versions of Ghostview
&gt;(e.g. Ghostview 1.5 using Ghostscript 3.33) can display your
&gt;paper.
&gt;
&gt;Alternate Method: 10 copies, via postal delivery to:
&gt;
&gt;EC'98 Submissions
&gt;USENIX Association
&gt;2560 Ninth Street, Suite 215
&gt;Berkeley, CA 94710
&gt;
&gt;For detailed submission guidelines, send email to ec98authors@usenix.org,
&gt;refer to the conference Web page at
&gt;www.usenix.org/events/ec98/guidelines.html,
&gt;or send email to the program chair at ec98chair@usenix.org.  An
&gt;electronic version of this Call for Papers is available at:
&gt;www.usenix.org/events/ec98/.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;BIRDS-OF-A-FEATHER SESSIONS (BoFs)
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a topic that you'd like to discuss with others? Our
&gt;Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions may be perfect for you. BoFs are very
&gt;interactive and informal gatherings for attendees interested in a
&gt;particular topic. Schedule your BoF in advance by telephoning the
&gt;USENIX Conference Office at 714.588.8649 or sending email to:
&gt;conference@usenix.org.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;AWARDS
&gt;
&gt;The program committee will offer awards of $500 for the best paper
&gt;and the best student paper.
&gt;
