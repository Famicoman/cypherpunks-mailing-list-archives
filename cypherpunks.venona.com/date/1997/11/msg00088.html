 I forwarded a copy of the above article to my friend Roger who lives and 
works in Thailand and this was his response ... I thought it might be of 
interest to the list.

&gt;&gt;Pol Pot Speaks
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On Oct. 16 Nate Thayer, an American correspondent for the weekly 
&gt;&gt;Far Eastern Economic Review, conducted the first known interview 
&gt;&gt;since 1979 with Cambodian Communist Pol Pot. The New York Times 
&gt;&gt;printed excerpts Oct. 23. 

&gt;Brian,
&gt;
&gt;Nate is actually based in Bangkok and I have met him quite a few 
&gt;times in one of my favourite watering holes. I was there last Friday 
&gt;(31st Oct) and was told that he had gone back to Phnom Penh to 
&gt;confront Hun Sen for calling him a liar and questioning the validity 
&gt;of his interview with Pol Pot. Nate apparently got very upset at 
&gt;this so he decided to sort it out. All of us who know him feel that 
&gt;he is risking his life by going back to Cambodia at this time. The 
&gt;situation there is very unstable and life is very cheap. We all 
&gt;hope he makes it back safely.
&gt;
&gt;Just for some background information, Nate is a very intense and 
&gt;proud fellow who takes his profession very seriously indeed. He is 
&gt;the only journalist to have been able to get close enough to Pol 
&gt;Pot (by close, I mean in very near proximity) to be able to watch 
&gt;and film him being tried by his fellow commanders and to interview 
&gt;him. A very facinating chap and very likeable. I am sure you came 
&gt;across some of these types during the Vietnam War.
&gt;
&gt;Will keep you posted.
&gt;
&gt;Roger
