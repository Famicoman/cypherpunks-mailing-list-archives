&gt;                U.N. CONFERENCE DEBATES LIMITS ON INTERNET SPEECH
&gt;                                        
&gt;      Internet racism graphic November 11, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 9:14 p.m. EST (0214 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      GENEVA (AP) -- Concerned at the growing use of the Internet for
&gt;      racist propaganda, international experts are debating how -- and
&gt;      whether -- to combat the spread of computerized hate messages.
&gt;      
&gt;      Binding global controls on the Internet are unlikely, officials said
&gt;      Tuesday, since the technology is changing faster than rules can be
&gt;      made, and because of free speech protection in the United States.
&gt;      
&gt;      The United Nations is sponsoring a week-long meeting of human rights
&gt;      activists, government officials and Internet service providers as
&gt;      part of efforts to ensure compliance with an international treaty
&gt;      banning racial discrimination. It ends Friday with a list of
&gt;      recommendations.
&gt;      
&gt;      "There are 148 countries who have accepted this convention and they
&gt;      are under obligation to enact measures to implement it," said Agha
&gt;      Shahi of Pakistan, a member of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination
&gt;      of Racial Discrimination.
&gt;      
&gt;      "Are we going to say the Internet should be exempt from any kind of
&gt;      compliance with the rules of international behavior?" he asked.
&gt;      
&gt;      It is widely agreed that the Internet offers an open platform for
&gt;      racists and white supremacists, although nothing has proved this
&gt;      leads to a related rise in racist incidents.
&gt;      
&gt;      Much of the problem stems from the United States, where groups such
&gt;      as the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations and skinheads base their Web
&gt;      sites.
&gt;      
&gt;      Under the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees free speech, these
&gt;      groups are permitted to post their views on the Internet, which can
&gt;      be accessed by people in other countries.
&gt;      
&gt;      Although European countries like Sweden have moved toward making
&gt;      Internet service providers responsible for the content they supply,
&gt;      such restrictions are unlikely in the United States, and hence,
&gt;      internationally.
&gt;      
&gt;      "In our tradition, it is only through the clash of views in vigorous
&gt;      debate, and not through government censorship, that equality is well
&gt;      served," Philip Reitinger of the U.S. Department of Justice said at
&gt;      the U.N. meeting. "That principle -- one which accords freedom of
&gt;      expression the highest respect -- applies with equal force to the
&gt;      Internet."
&gt;      
&gt;      While the U.S. computer industry is voluntarily working on ways to
&gt;      ensure that computer smut isn't accessible to minors, Eric Lee, of
&gt;      the Internet service provider Commercial Internet eXchange, said it
&gt;      was "not feasible and not desirable" for Internet providers to act
&gt;      as censors.
&gt;      
&gt;      "It's difficult if not impossible to suppress content on the Web
&gt;      because there are so many ways to evade controls," Lee said. "Which
&gt;      does not mean that one should not take steps to limit behavior, but
&gt;      coming up with foolproof controls is virtually impossible."
