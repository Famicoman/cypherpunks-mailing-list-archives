I think the following quotes speak for themselves:

	"You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a
reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go around repeating the
very phrases which our founding fathers used in their struggle for
independence."
	Charles M. Beard

	"They tell us we are weak—-unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.
But when shall we be stronger? Will it be next week, or the next year? Will
it be when we are totally disarmed? Shall we acquire the means of effectual
resistance by lying supinely on out backs and hugging the delusive phantom
of hope, until out enemies have bound us hand and foot?
	"We are not weak if we make a proper use of the means which the God of
nature has placed in out power. Millions of people armed in the hold cause
of Liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible.
Besides, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who
presides over the destinies of nations, who will raise up friends to fight
our battles for us. The battle, is not to the strong alone; it is to the
vigilant, the active, the brave.
	"Many cry 'Peace, peace'-—but there is no peace. The war is actually
begun! Why stand we here idle? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be
purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it Almighty God! I
know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me Liberty or
give me death!"
	Patrick Henry

	"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are
in almost every Kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot
enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are
armed..."
	Noah Webster

"If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace.
We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that
feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you; and may posterity forget
that ye were our countrymen."
-- Samuel Adams

"Stupidity is the one arena of of human achievement where most people
fulfill their potential."
-- Jonathan Wienke
