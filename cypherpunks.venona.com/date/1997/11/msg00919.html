&gt; ...
&gt;              But the most likely problems -- there are a couple
&gt; little babies in this audience, or there were today, and some
&gt; children -- the most likely problems these children will face
&gt; when they come of age will be problems that cross national
&gt; borders -- terrorism, organized crime and drug running, the
&gt; spread of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological
&gt; weapons and maybe small-scale nuclear weapons.

  If a New World Order saves the life of just one child...

&gt;              The spread of environmental problems or diseases
&gt; across national lines -- we are going to have to, in other words,
&gt; find ways to cooperate, to keep the organized forces of
&gt; destruction that are taking advantage of the Internet, the
&gt; technological revolution, the freedom of travel and the freedom
&gt; of movement, access to computers and moving money around and all
&gt; that -- there will always be organized forces of destruction.

  Anyone that's ever looked at a voting ballot can tell you he
speaks the truth about the forces of organized destruction being
with us forever.

  I've always said that Freedom of Movement was one of the main
reasons for the rapid decline of society. It's all that moving
around that people do between their work desks and their beds
at home that is the problem. Increased use of prison labor has
certainly proven that a War on Movement is a viable option.

  If we allow people to move their money around wherever they
want, as if it is really theirs, then the next thing you know,
they might start doing the things they want with the money
they earn, instead of what they are required to do with it.
  If we allow people to access computers, the organized forces
of destruction will use them to get an education, earn a living,
entertain themselves, and conspire to move around.

&gt;              That is fundamentally what is at stake in the stand
&gt; off we're having in Iraq today. 

(Summary, so far:)

		ORGANIZED FORCES OF DESTRUCTION!!! 
			IRAQ!!!

&gt;              And I say this not to frighten you. 

  Stand-up comedy at its finest.

&gt; I think the chances are quite good that
&gt; we can organize ourselves for this challenge and deal with it
&gt; very effectively.  

  "We" being the elite "across national borders" and "across
national lines"--the elite of the WORLD.
  "Organize ourselves" meaning: creating a NEW ORDER of organized
authority, laws and government.
  
&gt; I personally believe that the next 50 years
&gt; will be far more peaceful and less dangerous for our children and
&gt; our grandchildren than the last 50 years were.

  I *knew* he was going to mention children a couple more times
after the scare tactics. Am I goddamn *psychic*, or what?

&gt;  I also believe
&gt; they will be the most prosperous and interesting time in all of
&gt; human history -- but only if we do the right things.

  Translation~~"Only" those who "do the right things" are going to
find the NEW WORLD ORDER future "prosperous" and "interesting."

	BILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE!!!
  If any of you can read this speech by El Presidante and think of
those who spoke out against the National Socialists, the brownshirts,
the Nazis--at the same time--and not get a shiver down your spine...
  I will give you a check for $1,000,000,000 (postdated Jan 1, 2000).
