&gt; &gt; The real problem as I see it with democracy is that not only do your
&gt; &gt; neighbours get to vote to have you locked up for something which is
&gt; &gt; none of their business, and has no conceivable effect up on them; but
&gt; &gt; they actually get to vote for you to be charged for the "service" of
&gt; &gt; being locked up to protect you from yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly what kind of democracy are you speaking of? Sounds like you are
&gt; lumping them all into one big bucket, 

I figure it's a reasonable summary of a lot of democracies right now.

&gt; If so, please be so kind as to demonstrate how a representative,
&gt; constitutional, and majority democracy are the same? And for the
&gt; record, we have a constitutional representative democracy.

Didn't say they were "the same".  But they do share a characteristic:
distortions of free market in the form of voting for theft and
redistribution of other peoples money leading to annoying government
micro-management, and general do-gooder busy-body-ness, and the many
laws on thought crimes.

&gt; Personaly, I figure you must be one of those folks with a cognitive
&gt; disfunction. What part of "Congress shall make no law..." do you not 
&gt; understand?

I understand it, but US politicians either don't, or don't care and
largely ignore the constitution.  What does it matter whether I
understand it or not?  Your constitution says you can own and carry
guns; your politicians and law enforcement increasingly say that you
can not.  Your response to my saying that is that _I_ don't understand
the constitution?

&gt; &gt; The wild west was better than this state of affairs -- people didn't
&gt; &gt; have the energy or inclination to waste their own resources being nosy
&gt; &gt; parkers, and those that did were apt to wind up full of lead.
&gt; 
&gt; Boy, you history is simply fucked. If you seriosly think the west was like
&gt; television you should spend more time reading books and period newspapers
&gt; and less time looking at the boob-tube. 

I don't own a TV, and so don't watch much (by choice -- it's mostly
garbage); printed mass media is a bit better, but not that much.

&gt; At the height of the range wars there were only 9 murders associated
&gt; with the conflict, not hundreds as the popular entertainment media
&gt; and spin-doctor culture would have you believe. Get your fucking
&gt; facts straight.

I know, that was my point; recall that I said the murder rate was low.
The point was there were way less laws, and few were telling their
neighbours what they could think.

&gt; Face off's at high-noon simply didn't happen and poeple didn't run
&gt; around having gun fights all the time.

Right!
