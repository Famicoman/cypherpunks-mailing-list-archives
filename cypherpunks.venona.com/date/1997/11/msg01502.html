&gt;                   SURVEY SHOWS AMERICAN'S COMFORT WITH POLICE
&gt;                                        
&gt;      police contact November 22, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 7:01 p.m. EST (0001 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Justice Department survey examining the way
&gt;      the public interacts with police has found that one in five
&gt;      Americans makes some kind of contact with law enforcement officers
&gt;      each year mostly to report a crime, ask for help or offer
&gt;      assistance.
&gt;      
&gt;      The study, released Saturday, also found that less than 1 percent of
&gt;      people who made contact with police said officers used or threatened
&gt;      to use physical force. If force was used, most respondents said,
&gt;      their actions may have provoked it.
&gt;      
&gt;      The survey reveals nothing surprising, criminal justice experts
&gt;      said. They said it shows that Americans are turning to police in
&gt;      situations beyond emergencies.
&gt;      
&gt;      "I think to many people, the one in five number seems high. But it
&gt;      does emphasize the varied role police have as peace officers as
&gt;      opposed to just responding to crimes," said James Alan Fox, dean of
&gt;      the College of Criminal Justice at Boston's Northeastern University.
&gt;      "Most of the work police do is not necessarily respond to crimes."
&gt;      
&gt;      However, some feel the survey fails to address factors important to
&gt;      relationships police have with citizens. police directions
&gt;      
&gt;      "It probably doesn't really speak to the strained relations between
&gt;      the police and minority communities in America," said Arthur
&gt;      Lurigio, chairman of the Criminal Justice Department at Loyola
&gt;      University in Chicago.
&gt;      
&gt;      The first-of-its-kind study was culled from data in the annual
&gt;      National Criminal Victimization Survey conducted by the Bureau of
&gt;      Justice Statistics.
&gt;      
&gt;      According to the report, one-third of the contacts between the
&gt;      police and the public was related to seeking help or offering
&gt;      assistance. Another third was to report a crime, either as a witness
&gt;      or victim. Slightly less than one-third of respondents said the
&gt;      police had initiated the contact.
&gt;      
&gt;      White males and people in their 20s were the most likely to have
&gt;      face-to-face contact, the survey found. Hispanics and blacks were
&gt;      about 70 percent as likely as whites to have interacted with the
&gt;      police.
&gt;      
&gt;      The study was based on a survey of 6,421 people, age 12 and older,
&gt;      and used a sample of residents chosen to represent an entire
&gt;      population. No margin of error was given.
