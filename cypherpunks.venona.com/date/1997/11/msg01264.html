&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Anonymity has value that is greater than the value of CAUCE.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Could someone help a rookie here?  What's CAUCE and how does
&gt; &gt;it relate to anonymity.
&gt;  
&gt; It doesn't, per se, but a number of people choose to believe that.  CAUCE
&gt; is the Coalition Against Unsolicted Commercial Email and supports the
&gt; banning of such unsolicited advertisements.  See their web page at
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.cauce.org/">http://www.cauce.org/</A> for more information.  
&gt;  
&gt; The yelling is about the proposed (now ratified) robo-moderation policy
&gt; for the *newsgroup* to discuss CAUCE issues, comp.org.cauce, which requires
&gt; that you post with a deliverable email address.  This was supposed to
&gt; keep belligerant spammers and trolls from posting to the group without
&gt; having some kind of valid contact address.  This was not supposed to be
&gt; anti-privacy, anti-munging, or anti-anonymity, though that is what seems
&gt; to be the big issue many people were having with it.

That makes about as much sense as holding a rally to protest auto theft and
requiring that each attendee leave his car UNLOCKED in the parking lot while
attending.  In this case, the price of admission to this "anti-UCE party" is
to contribute one's e-mail address to the UCErs' mailing lists!

And what, exactly, is the point of requiring "belligerant spammers and 
trolls" to post with a valid e-mail address?  Unless they're planning to
spam or mailbomb each other, they are the ones who have the least to fear
from publicly broadcasting their e-mail addresses on a worldwide NG for the
address harvesters to collect and exploit.
