&gt; Subject: Is the BATF Up to Their Old Tricks Again?
&gt;
&gt; I am cross posting this e-mailed information received from a
&gt; Karmann in AZ. She has e-mailed me and sent local newspaper
&gt; information via snail mail to support her claims that her
&gt; community is being bullied by the BATF. For some reason they
&gt; are having a difficult time getting the information out - even
&gt; with a whole community and local newspaper of angry citizens.
&gt; Anyone that can assist and verify the following would be most
&gt; appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; ****************************************************************
&gt;
&gt; RIGHTS &amp; FREEDOMS AT RISK IN NEW RIVER, ARIZONA
&gt; New River is a small, non-incorporated community 30 miles north
&gt; of Phoenix, AZ.  On September 10, 1997, the BATF raided the
&gt; property of Charles Byers, a former munitions manufacturer.
&gt; On the property they found a shed containing chemicals that the
&gt; BATF claims are highly unstable and shock sensitive. A list of
&gt; the chemicals obtained via court records shows that most of the
&gt; chemicals are used in the production of fireworks. The shed has
&gt; been described by some as "a glorified high school chem. lab".
&gt; Our community, as well as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
&gt; are under an all out assault.  The BATF has invaded New River and
&gt; plans to create an environmental hazard against our wishes and
&gt; without legal permits.  On September 23, 1997, the BATF blew up
&gt; two bunkers full of explosives.  The community was not notified.
&gt; The resulting shock wave rattled houses as far as four miles away.
&gt; Kids at New River Elementary school were bounced out of their chairs
&gt; and  scared half out of their wits. The materials in the shed did
&gt; not ignite.
&gt; The BATF brought in heavy equipment to build a berm around the shed,
&gt; then constructed a concrete wall on top of it.  The BATF claims that
&gt; the heavy equipment did not set off the chemicals in the shed because
&gt; they used equipment with "rubber tires."
&gt; The BATF decided the only way to solve the problems of the unstable
&gt; chemicals is to burn the shed using Thermite as an accelerant to
&gt; incinerate the shed and its contents at temperatures between 3000
&gt; and 5000 degrees. This would completely destroy any organic compounds
&gt; that might exist.  The inorganic compounds would not be destroyed,
&gt; but would instead, vaporize and form possible new and deadly airborne
&gt; combinations. The EPA approved the BATF's plan, a federal judge
&gt; issued an evacuation order, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, went
&gt; along.  The burn was set for October 18, 1997.  The Sheriff, a thirty
&gt; year veteran of the DEA, sent his posse to notify residents that they
&gt; were to evacuate their property, including all domestic animals and
&gt; birds.  Since this is a rural area, most people have more than just
&gt; a cat or dog. Folks here raise horses, pigs, chickens and exotic
&gt; birds and animals.  Many raise more than one species and have
&gt; multiple head.
&gt; At a community meeting with the BATF, EPA and Sheriff Arpaio,
&gt; residents asked questions of the assembled panel.  The panel could
&gt; not or would not respond to residents inquires:  "What exactly was
&gt; in the shed and in what quantities?  What effect would burning the
&gt; chemicals have on our soil, air and ground water, both short and
&gt; long term?  Where were residents to take their animals?  Who was
&gt; going to pay for any damages sustained to properties (Brush fired
&gt; hazard is very high this time of the years)?"
&gt; It was evident that the effects of the burn had not been determined.
&gt;  The EPA representative said numerous times, "We will monitor before
&gt; and after."  Sheriff Arpaio threatened to forcibly remove anyone who
&gt; refused to leave their property.  He could not understand why
&gt; residents did not want - or appreciate - his 'protection'.  He stated
&gt; that it is within his power and responsibilities to protect us from
&gt; ourselves. So many people refused to evacuate that the October 18
&gt; burn was postponed until November 1, 1997.  Three hundred fifty homes
&gt; were to be evacuated, for 12 to 24 hours, within a three mile radius
&gt; of Byers' property.  The evacuation maps provided to us, prepared by
&gt; the BATF, were completely wrong.  They have been redrawn - with the
&gt; radius now only extending 1.5 miles so as not to inconvenience the
&gt; people in the Manufacturer's Outlet Mall nearly three miles from the
&gt; proposed burn site.    When asked, "If these chemicals are so
&gt; sensitive, why did the BATF set off explosions near the shed?", they
&gt; said it was a mistake.
&gt; We have not accepted that the federal, or even local, government can
&gt; force us to leave our homes, proceed with reckless behavior with
&gt; detrimental effects on our land, lives and livelihoods, and not be
&gt; accountable.  The BATF and Sheriff Arpaio have tried to make us feel
&gt; like we are over-reacting and just need to get with the program.
&gt; Sheriff Arpaio did not stop his threats of forcible removal - until
&gt; he was contacted by the community's attorney.
&gt; On October 25,1997, New River residents held a peaceful demonstration
&gt; at the site of the proposed burn.  We walked two miles up and down
&gt; steep hills and stood before the BATF with American flags.  We wanted
&gt; to remind the BATF that this is still America and that we have the
&gt; right to live peacefully on our property.  Our government cannot, on
&gt; a whim, destroy what we have worked so hard to build.
&gt; Certain sections of our government are testing American's resolve.
&gt; They are looking to see where we draw the line.  In New River, we
&gt; have drawn that line in the dirt we hold sacred.  We will not allow
&gt; the burn and will not leave our homes.
&gt; A talk show host in Phoenix called what's happening here "The New
&gt; River Rebellion."  We do not want New River added to the list of
&gt; American Tragedies that  includes Ruby Ridge and Waco.  Call your
&gt; own congressman or senator.  Let them know that you know about New
&gt; River.  If we let it happen here, where will it stop?
