&gt;	Crypto AG eventually paid one million dollars for
&gt;Buehler's release in January 1993, then promptly fired
&gt;him once they had reassured themselves that he hadn't
&gt;revealed anything important under interrogation, and
&gt;because Buehler had begun to ask some embarrassing
&gt;questions. Then reports appeared on Swiss television,
&gt;Swiss Radio International, all the major Swiss papers, and
&gt;in German magazines like Der Spiegel.  Had Crypto AG's
&gt;equipment been spiked by Western intelligence services?
&gt;the media wanted to know. The answer was Yes [4].
&gt;
[snip]
&gt;
&gt;	Representatives from NSA visited Crypto AG
&gt;often. A memorandum of  a secret workshop at Crypto
&gt;AG in August 1975, where a new prototype of an
&gt;encryption device was demonstrated, mentions the
&gt;participation of Nora L. Mackebee, an NSA
&gt;cryptographer. Motorola engineer Bob Newman says that
&gt;Mackebee was introduced to him as a "consultant".
&gt;Motorola cooperated with Crypto AG in the seventies in
&gt;developing a new generation of electronic encryption
&gt;machines.   The Americans "knew Zug very well and gave
&gt;travel tips to the Motorola people for the visit at Crypto
&gt;AG," Newman told Der Spiegel.
&gt;
&gt;	Knowledgeable sources indicate that the Crypto
&gt;AG enciphering process, developed in cooperation with
&gt;the NSA and the German company Siemans, involved
&gt;secretly embedding the decryption key in the cipher text.
&gt;Those who knew where to look could monitor the
&gt;encrypted communication, then extract the decryption key
&gt;that was also part of the transmission, and recover the
&gt;plain text message.  Decryption of a message by a
&gt;knowledgeable third party was not any more difficult that
&gt;it was for the intended receiver.  (More than one method
&gt;was used.  Sometimes the algorithm was simply deficient,
&gt;with built-in exploitable weaknesses.)

As I recall, this topic came up during a Cylink management meeting I
attended in late '92.  My recollection was that Cylink was asked by the
NSA/CIA to 'alter' some of its crypto units, which supposedly were being
sought by a Columbian cartele.  The party line was that we refused.  I
didn't follow up since I wasn't the product manager of that series.
