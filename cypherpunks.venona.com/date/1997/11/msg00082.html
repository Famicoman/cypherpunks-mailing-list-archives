&gt;&gt;Since when is broadcasting a radio or television show or writing an

&gt;The producers of the show had better hope that it is not evidence of
&gt;complicity in a murder.
&gt;
&gt;Let's say Tim is crazy.(*)  He told us how much he enjoyed seeing the
&gt;BATF agent take one in the face.  If this were to inspire him to try
&gt;the same thing in real life, how would the producers of the show be
&gt;less guilty than the talk show host?

According to the dubious logic of that episode, no doubt they would say
they were innocent because they had not _met_ me on any occasions. If,
however, the prosecution could produce a witness saying she had seen me in
the company of the writer, director, producer, etc., then their bacon would
be cooked. By the logic of their episode, of course.

&gt;
&gt;(*) Tim seems too wiley to be crazy.  Instead, he seems to be playing
&gt;The Most Dangerous Game: Fed baiting.
&gt;

It used to be called "free speech."

Nowadays, admitting that one has guns is fed baiting. Admitting that one
will defend one's self is fed baiting. Admtting that one has read certain
books is fed baiting. And using unbreakable crypto is fed baiting.

Ah, what has the world come to?
