&gt; I am very amused to see the Naderites on the warpath again. Better yet is
&gt; their claim that the Microsoft DoJ action is divorced from politics. 
   Declan, what exactly is that "claim" that you refer to?  Are you
referring to my note on AM-INFO that DOJ filed against Microsoft without
consulting the White House?  (Something that has been reported in the
press..  WSJ?).  Or is there something else you are referring to.  I
don't think I would say any antitrust action is "divorced" from
politics, including this one.

This

&gt; &gt;     "Fundamentally, I think it's a legal issue," says
&gt; &gt;Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications
&gt; &gt;Industry Association. "But to say whenever the
&gt; &gt;wealthiest man in America and one of the most powerful
&gt; &gt;companies in America is challenged by a cabinet
&gt; &gt;official, you can't say there's no political impact.
&gt; &gt;You're in a political world at that level."
&gt; 
&gt; And if we look at the history of antitrust we see that the political world
&gt; is often the most important one:
&gt; 
&gt; -- Nixon intervened in an antitrust action against ITT in 1971 in exchange
&gt; for a bribe: a hefty contribution to the 1972 Republican convention. "I
&gt; don't know whether ITT is bad, good or indifferent," he said on April 19,
&gt; 1971, the White House tapes reveal. "But there is not going to be any more
&gt; antitrust actions as long as I am in this chair...goddam it, we're going to
&gt; stop it."
&gt; 
&gt; -- Bush's assistant attorney general derailed a criminal investigation of
&gt; Georgia Power. This after the U.S. attorney in Atlanta had issued more than
&gt; five hundred subpoenas and two hundred witnesses were called to testify
&gt; before the grand jury. Why? Months earlier, the company's CEO raised
&gt; millions of dollars for the Republicans in 1988.
&gt; 
&gt; -- AT&amp;T and its manufacturing subsidary were engaged in a
&gt; billion-dollar-a-year price fixing scheme, the Justice Department claimed
&gt; in a complaint filed in January 1949. AT&amp;T persuaded a slew of high Defense
&gt; Department officials to oppose the action on national security grounds. The
&gt; Defense Secretary himself opposed it because of the "Korean emergency."
&gt; They forced the DoJ to settle the case without getting what it wanted: AT&amp;T
&gt; to sell Western Electric.
&gt; 
&gt; -- Teddy Roosevelt (who Jamie might recall was widely reported to be a
&gt; "trust buster") headed off a DoJ antitrust investigation of the electrical
&gt; industry. Roosevelt wrote: "I feel very strongly that the less activity
&gt; there is during the presidential election, unless it is necessary, the
&gt; better it will be."
&gt; 
&gt; Former NY Times and Newseek reporter David Burnham writes in his book about
&gt; the Justice Department: "The record is clear. Political campaign
&gt; contributions, personal bribes and other direct and indirect favors have
&gt; frequently influenced important Justice Department disions about the
&gt; enforcement of law... Virtually every administration has demanded that the
&gt; Justice Department bend the law..."
