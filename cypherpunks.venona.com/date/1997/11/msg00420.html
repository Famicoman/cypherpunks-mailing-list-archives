&gt;                   CHILD HEIRESS AT THE CENTER OF TWISTED PLOT
&gt;                                        
&gt;       Onassis November 7, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 7:50 p.m. EST (0050 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      JERUSALEM (AP) -- As part of a battle over a young girl's $2.4
&gt;      billion trust fund, former Israeli secret service agents tracked her
&gt;      father's movements using paragliders and cameras hidden in trees.
&gt;      
&gt;      At least, that's the Israeli version of what happened to Athena
&gt;      Roussel, the granddaughter of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle
&gt;      Onassis.
&gt;      
&gt;      Swiss authorities, however, suspect the Israelis may have been
&gt;      involved in a plot to kidnap the 12-year-old girl and want them
&gt;      arrested.
&gt;      
&gt;      Much of the story, hushed up for months, remains shrouded inmystery,
&gt;      though bits and pieces have emerged in the Israeli media.
&gt;      
&gt;      The daily newspaper Maariv ran a banner headline Friday about"An
&gt;      operation to save the Onassis fortune." Next to it was apicture of
&gt;      an angelic-looking Athena wearing a white dress and a garland of
&gt;      white flowers in her honey-colored hair.
&gt;      
&gt;      Athena is the only child of Christina Onassis, the shipping
&gt;      magnate's daughter, and her fourth husband, Thierry Roussel. The
&gt;      couple divorced 1987 and Christina Onassis died a year later.
&gt;      Roussel has remarried and has three children with his new wife.
&gt;      Athena lives with her father and his new family in Switzerland and
&gt;      France.
&gt;      
&gt;      Athena stands to inherit some $2.4 billion when she turns 18,and in
&gt;      the meantime her father and the Greek executors of hermother's will
&gt;      have been fighting over control of the money.
&gt;      
&gt;      Roussel receives $5 million a year for personal expenses, under his
&gt;      ex-wife's will. Expenses for Athena are confidential.
&gt;      
&gt;      Roussel recently sued the charitable Alexander S. Onassis Public
&gt;      Benefit Foundation, accusing it of having mismanaged and embezzled
&gt;      millions of dollars. A Greek court acquitted the foundation earlier
&gt;      this year.
&gt;      
&gt;      Israeli police said that at some point, Greek trustees turned to
&gt;      Israeli private investigators and asked them to find evidence that
&gt;      Athena's father was involved in "immoral acts."
&gt;      
&gt;      The seven Israelis -- among them former top agents in Israel's Shin
&gt;      Bet security service -- began by preparing surveillance on the
&gt;      Roussel mansion near Geneva, according to Maariv and the Yediot
&gt;      Ahronot daily newspaper.
&gt;      
&gt;      This was a complicated task, the newspapers said, sinceintruders
&gt;      could easily be spotted near the heavily guarded,isolated compound.
&gt;      One solution the agents came up with, saidYediot, was to use
&gt;      paragliders to fly over the Roussel home and take pictures from the
&gt;      air.
&gt;      
&gt;      Another scheme to avoid drawing attention was to have
&gt;      agentsmasquerade as environmentalists driving around in a
&gt;      vanplastered with "green" stickers.
&gt;      
&gt;      The Israeli team also proposed to hide surveillance cameras in the
&gt;      trees of the compound and use state-of-the-art laser technology to
&gt;      wiretap Roussel's home and office, Maariv said.
&gt;      
&gt;      In a second stage, the surveillance team hired another Israeli
&gt;      investigator to check out Roussel's Paris apartment, the newspaper
&gt;      said. The agent learned, said Maariv, that Roussel was running a
&gt;      modeling agency there, and at one point hired a British model to try
&gt;      and infiltrate Roussel's business.
&gt;      
&gt;      The surveillance efforts came to light when an Israeli businessman
&gt;      and a friend of the Paris agent found out about it and tried to sell
&gt;      the information for profit. The businessman was questioned by Swiss
&gt;      police who began an investigation.
&gt;      
&gt;      It was at this stage, said Maariv and Yediot, that the Greektrustees
&gt;      ordered the Israeli team to drop its efforts.
&gt;      
&gt;      In a statement Friday, the Onassis Foundation accused Roussel of a
&gt;      campaign to remove his daughter from the control of the trustees,
&gt;      "even in matters of security."
&gt;      
&gt;      However, foundation officials refused comment on the record when
&gt;      asked whether trustees had hired the Israelis.
&gt;      
&gt;      Last month, Swiss police officials came to Israel to questionseveral
&gt;      of the Israeli investigators who had since returned home.
&gt;      
&gt;      Israeli police said they decided to close the case because they had
&gt;      no evidence of wrongdoing. An Israeli police investigator said he
&gt;      was convinced the Israeli agents had simply carried out surveillance
&gt;      and were not involved in a kidnapping plot.
&gt;      
&gt;      But a Swiss judge investigating the kidnapping suspicions said he
&gt;      doubted the Israeli version.
&gt;      
&gt;      "It's their way of seeing things and it's convenient forthem," said
&gt;      Judge Jacques Delieutraz of Geneva. "They don't have all the facts
&gt;      we have."
