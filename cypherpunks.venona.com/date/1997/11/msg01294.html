&gt;                   2ND GREAT AWAKENING &amp; WESTWARD EXPANSION
&gt;                                        
&gt; 1815-1850
&gt; 
&gt;    
&gt;    This time period brought the young country through rapid social and
&gt;    economic change. This change brought with it regional and cultural
&gt;    tensions. Americans sought personal, social and economic improvements
&gt;    in their lives. A new middle class arose as people moved from rural to
&gt;    urban settings. In the Northeast, lives changed for girls and women as
&gt;    the factory system took hold. Lowell Mill Girls Americans also took
&gt;    aim at the problems resulting from rapid social change and women like
&gt;    Dorothea Dix left their mark on society. Women also began leaving
&gt;    their mark in the professions, more and more women began teaching and
&gt;    one courageous women, despite unbelieveable odds recieved a medical
&gt;    degree. Elizabeth Blackwell 
&gt;    
&gt;    Participation in the anti-slavery movement inspired many women to
&gt;    consider their own role in society. Some believed like Catharine
&gt;    Beecher that a women's place was in her duty to home and family. She
&gt;    wrote her down her thoughts in her Treatiste on Domestic Economy.
&gt;    Sarah Hale, in the meantime spent 40 years defining for millions of
&gt;    American women their proper sphere...refined, educated, moral,
&gt;    wholesome, tasteful, gentle and skillful homemakers. She did this
&gt;    through Godey's Lady's Book. While women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton
&gt;    took a more active role in the fight for equal rights for women. An
&gt;    important day came for women when Stanton and others issued the
&gt;    Declaration of Sentiments at the Seneca Falls Convention, in Seneca
&gt;    Falls, New York.
&gt;    
&gt;    American pushed westward toward Texas, California and Oregon in search
&gt;    of new opportunities. The lives of the Native Americans were once more
&gt;    impacted by the movement of the white man. Thousands of settlers
&gt;    traveled west over the Oregon Trail to Oregon and California. Among
&gt;    them Narcissa Whitman who was the first white women to travel the
&gt;    Oregon Trail.
