Yipee!  The know-nothings are back and vehement about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--Tim May
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now that's a tasteful bit of humor, if I do say so myself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's so nice to know that being lucky enough to be born in the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;authorizes us to look down on and hey, advocate killing those who aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so fortunate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;sigh&gt; I can hear the violins playing in the background.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hey, it beats the stomping of jackboots and shouts of 'Sig Heil!'
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is no different than shooting a burglar that has broken into your
&gt;&gt;&gt;house and is robbing it. I think that you are missing a basic concept that
&gt;&gt;&gt;it is not their country!! If where they are at is such a miserable
&gt;&gt;&gt;shithole then maybe they should do somthing to fix their country rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;than comming here and attempt to make it yet another miserable shithole.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Of course, you have an unimpeachable claim, although 'Geiger the III' is
&gt;&gt;a rather odd last name for an American Indian.
&gt;
&gt;My impeachable claim is I am here and they are not. I see no reason why I
&gt;or anyone else should sit idly by and watch the SouthWest be turned into a
&gt;Mexican colony. You bring up the American Indians, it is interesting to
&gt;note that if they had bothered to stand up against the European invaders
&gt;and defended their boarders from the begining they more then likely would
&gt;still be running the place.
&gt;
&gt;"Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it."
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;It is not the fault of America that Mexico is the shithole that it is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps if they were to overthrow their corrupt government and replaced it
&gt;&gt;&gt;with one based on freedom (both political and economic) there would be no
&gt;&gt;&gt;need for them to come here in the first place. California, New Mexico,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Arizona, and Texas should not be the release valve for a corrupt Mexican
&gt;&gt;&gt;government so they can continue to rape their country and leave their
&gt;&gt;&gt;citizens in poverty.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Lets see.  Are you aware of how Texas, California, and New Mexico came to
&gt;&gt;be part of the US?  Probably doesn't matter - those dang furriners had no
&gt;&gt;right to the lands they lived on anyway, once the U.S. decided it wanted
&gt;&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;So are you suggesting we give it back? Perhaps everyone should just pack
&gt;up and go back to Europe or Asia or Africa and give it all back to the
&gt;Indians? Of course you do know that the "Native Americans" that were in
&gt;North America at the time Europeans started to colonize North America were
&gt;not the "original" humans here. There were actually several waves of
&gt;humans coming over the Siberia-Alaska land bridge over a long period of
&gt;time. I am sure that the peace loving "Native Americans" wouldn't think of
&gt;conquering lands occupied by others now would they??
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't find it at all surprising that people who live in a 'shithole'
&gt;&gt;want to leave.  It is easy for you to suggest that they overthrow their
&gt;&gt;government - after all, you won't be the one facing a Mexican prison.  
&gt;
&gt;Personally I could care less what they do. It's not my problem it is
&gt;theirs. It is their responsibility to fix their problems. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is going way off topic at this point, and I am at fault for starting
&gt;&gt;it.  I was just distressed at how rapidly this list seems to be turning
&gt;&gt;towards hate and bigotry.  Lets take it to email.
&gt;
&gt;There is no hatred or bigotry involved in my position. I am really
&gt;apathetic towards the Mexicans. They can go and do whatever they want so
&gt;long as they are not doing it here. The same goes for the Germans, French,
&gt;Ethiopians, Iraqies, Iraelies, Australians, Japanizes, et. al. 
&gt;
&gt;I don't care what my neighbor does in his house so long as he doesn't try
&gt;comming over and doing it in mine.
