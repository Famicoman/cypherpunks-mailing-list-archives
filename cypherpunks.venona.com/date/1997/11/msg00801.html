&gt;&gt; And it was even settled reasonably, and without setting new bad UK case law.

Don't be so fast to applaud this agreement to "settle."

The "settlement" was at the point of a gun, figuratively. The lawsuit.

In the view of many legal experts, and most libertarians I know, one does
not have property rights to _footnotes_ or _pointers_.

Citing a URL is like saying "Read "War and Peace."" Or even giving its call
number in a library.

If some newspaper has URLs for anyone to access, and another newspaper
publishes those URLs, the situation is exact.

I will admit that the Web has made the metaphor of "looking something up"
now much easier. There is a _sense_ that clicking on a link "takes one
there" (to a place). There is a _sense_ that links embedded in a text or on
a page are the property of, or were created by, the author of the text or
page that included them.

This is clearly false, in most cases. People need to be educated about this.

"Settlements" of the sort here are not a good thing if they help establish
the precedent (I realize only court decisions will do that, formally) that
one must ask permission before including pointers, footnotes, references,
and URLs.

And there are many technical solutions. From password security to placement
of large banners in the destination URLs.
