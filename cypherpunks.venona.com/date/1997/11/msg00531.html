&gt; &gt;I had a go at doing something with it (I'll let you know when I get
&gt; &gt;it to work) -- I had the damnest job figuring out what was going on.
&gt; &gt;The problem I found with understanding it were all of the nested
&gt; &gt;functions called through vectors of functions and handler functions.
&gt; &gt;Makes it hard to inspect what will happen without running the code
&gt; &gt;under a debugger -- lots control flow is decided at run time.
&gt; 
&gt; So in other words, even though we have the source code we don't really
&gt; have confidence that we can tell what it is doing.

There were only a few obscure points.  Most of it can be determined from
hex dumps of the files produced.  I had public key management before I saw
the source code.  Since I have a version that does not use any PGP source,
but PGP 5.x interoperates fully, I think I can tell precisely what it is
doing.

&gt; Even though the source code is available, I don't think it has been
&gt; studied all that carefully.  For example, hardly anybody knew that the
&gt; PGP 5.0 source had CAK features lurking in it.  Or, remember that bug
&gt; with the random number generator?  As I recall (i.e., feel free to
&gt; correct me), it was in Colin Plumb's code and he found it himself.
&gt; This would imply that it got by whoever went over the code when it was
&gt; released.  Not reassuring.

There is that section for CAK in a future expansion note in Vol. 1 of the
source.  There is probably a note in the CP archives I posted eons ago,
long before the 5.5 controversy spawned all the traffic about CAK.  It was
near the new passphrase hash which was one thing I could not figure out
without the source. 

&gt; C is a big part of the problem.  Also, PGP was originally designed to
&gt; operate on some fairly slow machines and they tried very hard to
&gt; optimize the hell out of it.  Now, however, cycles are a lot cheaper.
&gt; I think we should give up speed for clarity.  Slow code that we can
&gt; really trust is better.

C is not part of the problem, people who aren't good at abstraction are.
It would look even more horrid in modula-2(3?).  If you have something go
through three layers instead of one, it will be more complicated, for
instance I did something more like:

*hashstart[]() = {md5start,sha1start,ripemd160start};

instead of the layering.
