&gt; You admit here that you've said you hope to see D.C. nuked.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you really hope that D.C. gets nuked?  Do other list readers agree?
&gt; How many people would this kill?  Over half a million live in the city
&gt; proper, with millions more in the surrounding areas.  You have now said
&gt; that you would hope to see many of these millions of people killed.

  Are you preparing this testimony for the trial, or for the press?
I'd be more than happy to kick in some leftover plutonium for you to
plant in Tim's home, if you plan on setting him up after I've finished
my...uuhhh...home project.
 
&gt; It is this kind of support for depraved violence which has poisoned
&gt; discourse on this mailing list.  It is unconscionable to support such
&gt; an act of cold-blooded terrorism.

  Most of the "poison" seems to be coming from Tim's detractors, chief
of whom is yourself, at present. Why don't you try limiting yourself
to 10,000 words of ranting and finger-pointing for every "Nuke DC"
statment Tim makes?
 
&gt; You're not even the worst.  Other posters have supported this kind of
&gt; sickening violence even more openly.  No one complains.  Apparently
&gt; everyone with an ounce of moral sense has left the list long ago.

  Please give the rest of us credit for being self-willed individuals
who are perfectly capable of promoting our own brand of sickening
violence, rather than just going along with the suggestions that
Tim makes in our late-night secret meetings where we discuss the
our plans for the overthrow of anarchy in the world.

&gt; You seem to think that the only problem with Waco is that the wrong
&gt; innocents were killed.  You have no problem taking out innocents
&gt; in Washington D.C. if it lets you get at your enemies.  You are no
&gt; different from the agents who killed the men, women and children in Waco.
&gt; You have no right to set yourself apart from them.  You are as ruthless
&gt; and violent as the worst of them.

  As Robert Hettinga stated in a previous post, I think that your
constant rants about innocent childen betray some kind of sick 
fixation on them. Please try to keep your hands away from your
private body parts when thinking about them. That might help.
 
&gt; This list reeks of death and violence.  Apparently there is no problem
&gt; which can't be solved by killing.  Kill the innocents of D.C.  Kill the
&gt; children in the day care center in Oklahoma City.  Drop more bombs on
&gt; Japan.  Cheer the cold-blooded murder of a government agent.  Kill the
&gt; children who scrawl graffiti on your mailbox.

  Boy, now I'm having problems keeping my hands away from _my_ private
parts. Back in a minute...

... 
&gt; Of course you have the right to post what you like.  But when you spew
&gt; garbage, I have the right to say it stinks.  It seems that other posters
&gt; have lost their sense of smell.  They say that's what happens when you
&gt; spend your time wallowing in sewage.

  You seem to be the one both pumping most of the sewage and doing
most of the wallowing in it. Of course, you're just groping around
in it looking for 'bad' people, aren't you? It's not like you get
cheap, vicarious thrills dwelling on these kinds of topics.
  When you testify in court, or give your interviews to the press,
remember to keep your hands tucked in your armpits. Folding them
together on your lap might prove to be too much of a temptation.

  BTW, thanks for those pictures of Princess Di's death scene that
you sent me. Great closeups!
