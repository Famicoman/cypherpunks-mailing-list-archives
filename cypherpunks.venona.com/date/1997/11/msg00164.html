&gt;The producers of the show certainly know that there are terrorist
&gt;elements and psychopaths who would be watching.  They know that these
&gt;people will be turned on by the imagery of a BATF agent being brutally
&gt;murdered.  They could have told the same story using different
&gt;imagery.  Instead of using graphic violence, they could have expressed
&gt;the idea of the BATF agent getting killed with a heartrending scene of
&gt;his wife getting the phone call.  That certainly would not have been
&gt;inflammatory.
&gt;
&gt;But they didn't.  The opted to go with a glorification of the act.
&gt;Why?  Incompetence won't wash - anybody getting to national TV has
&gt;spent years in the business and is a total pro.  They know what effect
&gt;they are having.

True.  I think the majority of the Hollywood community is on our side
in this one.  Folks likes Clint Eastwood have made a sincere effort to
expose the BATFucks for the thugs they are.  Some of you may recall
that Clint has become a vocal critic of the seige at Waco and spoken
out against it on several occasions.

&gt;They glorified this act of violence to encourage others to do the
&gt;same.  Where is the FBI?  Why isn't anybody doing anything?  If the
&gt;life of only one BATF agent is spared, it will be worthwhile!  Think
&gt;of his poor wife and kids.

Yes, imagine having to be related to such a creep.

&gt;Remailers?  ;-)

Though not a panacea, remailers do create some interesting possibilities
for the freedom of expression.
