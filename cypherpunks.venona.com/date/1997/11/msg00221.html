This Jodi Hoffman is most likely laughing at you all
after baiting you so successfully.

I refuse to believe that she could have been so dumb to write
what she wrote, seriously.

&gt; Having Tourette Syndrome can sometimes be a burden, particularly when

&gt; where all of those huddled masses of naughty words, struggling to be
&gt; free, can be expressed in a meaningful manner, thus living a productive
&gt; life instead of being just wasted.

&gt; &gt; From: Jodi Hoffman &lt;jlhoffm@ibm.net&gt;
&gt; &gt; To: fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu
&gt; &gt; Subject: Why porn must be stopped at all costs.....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ALL:
&gt; &gt; I've forgotten how long I've been on this email list.  Maybe too long.
&gt; 
&gt;   Don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I wander back through all the posts on this list, it finally dawns on
&gt; &gt; me what this is all about, this 'fight censorship' rhetoric.  It's
&gt; &gt; nothing more and nothing less than a lot of egotistical, self-serving
&gt; &gt; brats who absolutely refuse to grow up, including you, Declan.  Don't
&gt; &gt; you realize that YOU are a major reason for the downward spiral of
&gt; &gt; society?
&gt; 
&gt;   Why do I get the feeling that this Dumb Cunt (TM) has 'all of the
&gt; answers' for society and everyone in it, and is about to share them 
&gt; with us?
&gt;   Well, if she expects us to listen to the divine wisdom of her
&gt; words from the mount, I guess she had better explain to us how we
&gt; are just dirt under her feet, so that we will realize we need to
&gt; listen and learn from her.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Instead of trying to protect children, you want to empower
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt;   The shame! The shame!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Even a moron knows that when you do so, that power has to be
&gt; &gt; taken from someone.  
&gt; 
&gt;   Typo...*should* read "Only a moron knows..."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, that someone is the parent.  I have
&gt; &gt; to ask myself just how many on this list have children.  Not many, I
&gt; &gt; would say.
&gt; 
&gt;   That's right...you ask AND answer the questions, and we'll just 
&gt; sit here and shut the fuck up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Someone on this list, I forget who, has made numerous attempts at
&gt; &gt; convincing us that pornography 'does no harm' to children.
&gt; 
&gt;   Does "numerous attempts at convincing" translate to "expressed an
&gt; opinion I disagreed with?"
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  It is
&gt; &gt; exactly at this point that I must draw a line.  Studies have shown that
&gt; &gt; an event which lasts even so much as three-tenths of a second, within
&gt; &gt; five to ten minutes has produced a structural change in the brain.
&gt; &gt; Exposure to porn causes actual brain damage, especially in a child.
&gt; 
&gt;   Good idea to make vague, unsubstantiated claims in this area. If you
&gt; provided sources and references, someone might be able to throw them
&gt; back in your face and laugh at you for being an ignorant sack of shit,
&gt; using self-serving 'studies' to support untenable logic.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; So, keep protecting your porn-induced orgasms.
&gt; 
&gt;   Protecting? Hell, I strive to share them with as many people as
&gt; possible. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  That's exactly what happened with the Hitler youth, etc...
&gt; 
&gt;   Uuhhh...you've got a 'study' to not-quote on this theory too, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  After all, I'm sure it does help
&gt; &gt; to blur the lines of reality.
&gt; 
&gt;   This makes even less sense than the last sentence. Are you trying
&gt; to communicate propaganda that you don't fully understand?
&gt;   Perhaps you should just stick to slogans and sound-bytes, rather 
&gt; than trying to turn strings of disparate sentences into paragraphs.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;end of 'Windup'&gt;
&gt; &gt; =====================
&gt; &lt;and here comes the 'Pitch'&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please PRINT THIS OUT and save for later reference.  Rules number 1
&gt; &gt; through 7 have already been put into effect.  Rule number 8 is currently
&gt; &gt; being implemented.  Numbers 9 and 10 are already in the beginning
&gt; &gt; phases.   If you're not yet convinced that you are contributing to the
&gt; &gt; ruination of America, I would hope you will be by the time you finish
&gt; &gt; reading this.
&gt; &gt; Paul and Jodi Hoffman

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "When an opponent declares, "I will not come over to your side", I
&gt; &gt; calmly say, "Your child belongs to us already..."  --Adolph Hitler,
&gt; &gt; speaking about the schools and their indoctrination of the Hilterjugend
&gt; &gt; (Hitler Youth Corps).
&gt; 
&gt;   Are you positive this quote isn't from Eisenhower, in regard to the
&gt; American public educational system?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ==================================================
&gt; &gt; LENIN'S BLUEPRINT FOR WORLD DOMINATION
&gt; &gt; These 'Rules' are meant to be a loose parody of the Ten Commandments,
&gt; &gt; and are particularly emphasized at the Lenin School of Political
&gt; &gt; Warfare.   They are practical rules that are being implemented all over
&gt; &gt; the world -- with special emphasis on the strongest foe of Communism,
&gt; &gt; the United States.
&gt; &gt; Study these Rules very carefully. And then reflect upon what is
&gt; &gt; happening in our society right now.   Perhaps this list will provide
&gt; &gt; answers to some of the questions that seemed --until now -- to have no
&gt; &gt; answers.
&gt; &gt; Lenin himself said that it didn't matter that three-fourths of the world
&gt; &gt; be destroyed, just so the remnant were good Communists.
&gt; 
&gt;   Are you sure this wasn't Nixon, taling about Vietnam and Democracy?
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #1:     CORRUPT THE NATION'S YOUTH
&gt; 
&gt;   Alright! Party time!
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; The future of any nation lies with its youth. So corrupt them; since
&gt; &gt; religion teaches moral virtue, erode the churches and divert the young
&gt; &gt; from religion. Make them interested only in themselves. Get them
&gt; &gt; involved in drugs, alcohol, and sex. Get them addicted to privileges and
&gt; &gt; rights.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; Many of today's youth are grossly overprivileged, committed to fashion,
&gt; &gt; physically flabby and lazy, and mentally undisciplined. If they don't
&gt; &gt; want to do something, they simply will not do it. And if they want to do
&gt; &gt; something to indulge themselves, no law or moral standard will hold them
&gt; &gt; back.  They feel that they are entitled to the 'good things in life,'
&gt; &gt; not as a reward for hard work, but as an expected gift, to be received
&gt; &gt; without effort and even without asking.  And where do they learn such
&gt; &gt; slovenliness? Just spend two hours in front of a television watching a
&gt; &gt; random selection of situation comedies to find out. Unfortunately, kids
&gt; &gt; who fit the above description usually model themselves after their
&gt; &gt; parents.  Such parasitic habits would not be tolerated in the former
&gt; &gt; Soviet Union.
&gt; &gt; The prevailing attitude among today's pampered American youth is one of
&gt; &gt; nihilism ( I am nothing, life has no meaning, I don't care) -- and for
&gt; &gt; good reason.  Over 75 percent of America's high school boys now think
&gt; &gt; it's acceptable to rape a girl at any age.  Wonder why anymore?
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   It sounds like the Dumb Cunt (TM) is suggesting that the former Soviet
&gt; Union would have been a better place to raise our kids.
&gt;   Yep, go to any high school and all the boys talk about is going over
&gt; to the maternity wing of the hospital and porking the little sluts as
&gt; they exit the womb. Honest! There are _studies_ that show this!
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #2:     CONTROL THE MASS MEDIA
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Since the media shapes the minds of the people, infiltrate it and
&gt; &gt; control it.  Dominate television, radio, and the newspapers, and you
&gt; &gt; control the minds of the people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; It is quite obvious that traditional values are considered ridiculous to
&gt; &gt; all branches of the media.   Christians, clergy, and even Christ Himself
&gt; &gt; are held up as objects of scorn and mocking laughter by television,
&gt; &gt; motion pictures, radio, artists, and songwriters.  In the place of
&gt; &gt; decency and morality, a constant stream of Left-wing values is
&gt; &gt; presented.
&gt; &gt; Homosexuality, abortion, violence, and contempt for all parental and
&gt; &gt; governmental authority is the prevailing order of the day.   A
&gt; &gt; particularly powerful form of media is represented by the so-called
&gt; &gt; "arts community."   Some latter-day "artists" actually make a
&gt; &gt; pretty good living by mocking traditional values and Christianity.
&gt; &gt; Consider Andres Sorrano's "Piss Christ" (a photograph of a crucifix
&gt; &gt; submerged in urine) or Robert Mapplethorp's photos, which include one
&gt; &gt; showing a bullwhip protruding out of his rear end.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This media bias is not a fantasy of a few right-wing whiners; this is
&gt; &gt; cold, hard reality.
&gt; &gt; The extreme leftward tilt of the media has been documented by impartial
&gt; &gt; observers and study managers, and has even been acknowledged by the
&gt; &gt; press itself.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   It is unconscienable for the mass media to hold traditional values 
&gt; up to scorn, and mock Ra, Isis, and the many, many gods who were born
&gt; of a virgin and died and rose after three days, the last of which was...
&gt; hang on, his name is on the tip of my tongue...Jesus!
&gt;   Remember: left wing values =/= decency and morality
&gt;   Is the Dumb Cunt telling us that the Moral Majority, which would
&gt; by definition be the "prevailing order of the day," are a bunch of
&gt; queer, violent aborionists with contempt for parental authority?
&gt; I _thought_ there was something weird about those fuckers.
&gt;   Those were non-Christian 'impartial' observers and study managers,
&gt; right? &lt;snicker-snicker-guffah!&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #3:     ENCOURAGE PUBLIC INDIFFERENCE
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Cause the people to become disinterested in their own government and in
&gt; &gt; world affairs. Get them to feel disenfranchised. Get them to ridicule
&gt; &gt; and lose respect for government leaders.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; Americans now vote at a lower rate than at any other time in our
&gt; &gt; history. Every American knows how disenfranchised and powerless the
&gt; &gt; average voter feels.  The media constantly trumpet instances of
&gt; &gt; hypocrisy and corruption in our government, despite the fact that we
&gt; &gt; have the most open and honest political system in the world.
&gt; 
&gt;   Hold it!
&gt;   &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;barf&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;barf&gt;
&gt;   OK, continue...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   The
&gt; &gt; United States Supreme Court has wrested much of the State's power from
&gt; &gt; them with judicial activism.   This means that the people's
&gt; &gt; representatives at the State level -- and therefore the people
&gt; &gt; themselves -- have much less of a voice in their own government.
&gt; &gt; On the state level, when people or local legislators finally manage to
&gt; &gt; pass a conservative law regarding abortion, pornography or
&gt; &gt; homosexuality, it is invariably challenged by Neo-liberal groups and
&gt; &gt; struck down by higher courts, leading voters to ask themselves
&gt; &gt; "Why bother participating in the process? We have no real voice in how
&gt; &gt; things are run anyway!"
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   This is the communists doing this, again, right? Flouridated water,
&gt; etc?
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #4:     ENCOURAGE PUBLIC BICKERING
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Divide the people into hostile groups. Divide them against themselves by
&gt; &gt; getting them to squabble about inconsequential social issues.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; Never before have so many trivial issues captured so much air time.
&gt; &gt; Major construction and other projects are halted due to sometimes
&gt; &gt; trivial environmental concerns.  Critical research which uses animals is
&gt; &gt; halted or impeded by animal-rights groups.  Sodomy rights, old- growth
&gt; &gt; timber, anti-fur, and dozens of other Neoliberal causes (and the
&gt; &gt; conservative backlash) cause more friction among our nation's people
&gt; &gt; than in any other nation in the world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, the real issues of importance are either entirely neglected
&gt; &gt; or paid weak lip service:   Crime, poverty, hunger and, beneath all of
&gt; &gt; them, the moral disintegration of our country.   All of these have lead
&gt; &gt; to despair among those affected and encourage violent change at any
&gt; &gt; cost, with no thought given to the kind of change being fought for.
&gt; &gt; Naturally, when conservatives react to Neoliberal initiatives with
&gt; &gt; concrete action, they are painted as agents of "divisiveness" and
&gt; &gt; "disunity," further leading to the impression that American society is
&gt; &gt; composed entirely of squabbling special-interest groups.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   If the Dumb Cunt (TM) and her right-wing bum-buddies would quit
&gt; opposing environmental concerns, animal-rights, sodomy and dozens 
&gt; of other Neoliberal causes, then there wouldn't be all of that 
&gt; bickering now, would there? 
&gt;   The TruthMonger of the fact is, the problem is that the "real issues
&gt; of importance" *_ARE_* the subject of "concrete action" by those who
&gt; have decided that their own conservative values should be legislated
&gt; into governmental existence in the interests of punishing and 
&gt; imprisoning those with different values.
&gt;   I've never seen anyone imprisoned for _not_ smoking a joint.
&gt;   Think about _that_ you Ignorant Nazi Bitch!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #5:      SEIZE POWER, THEN CENSOR
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Always preach true democracy, but seize power as completely and
&gt; &gt; ruthlessly as possible.  Vigorously censor viewpoints that conflict with
&gt; &gt; ours.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; If the slightest complaint against pornography in our schools is raised
&gt; &gt; by concerned parents, People for the American Way (PAW), the ACLU, and
&gt; &gt; other left-wing groups instantly shout "censorship!"   But they say not
&gt; &gt; a word when it is pointed out that the Bible and all mention of morality
&gt; &gt; in textbooks have been ruthlessly hounded from the schools.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Religion has literally disappeared from our children's textbooks. The
&gt; &gt; media relentlessly suppress the reasoning behind conservative and
&gt; &gt; traditional viewpoints while reporting their version of the facts and
&gt; &gt; claiming "impartiality."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Artists' demand that the people pay for their atrocities. When the
&gt; &gt; people balk, the 'artists' whine about censorship. All traditional
&gt; &gt; groups and viewpoints are fair game for ridicule; yet when was the last
&gt; &gt; time you saw any 'artist' making fun of sodomites or women?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In other words, the censorship is all one-way. And the "pluralism"
&gt; &gt; valued so much by the Neoliberals is entirely unilateral (one way only).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Communist atrocities which have killed more than 150 million all over
&gt; &gt; the world are glossed over or ignored, but the most trivial
&gt; &gt; international action by the United States brings immediate and forceful
&gt; &gt; condemnation.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   The Bibles were removed from the schools by the white Christian
&gt; kids barricaded inside, thowing the Bibles at the niggers, as they
&gt; tried to enter the school buildings. While waiting for the Bibles
&gt; to be replaced the students had nothing left to read but the
&gt; Constitution, and realized that the Bibles shouldn't have been
&gt; there in the first place.
&gt;   I would like to remind the Dumb Cunt that there are no laws
&gt; prohibiting her children from bowing and praying toward Mecca
&gt; three times a day, and it would probably do them some good.
&gt;   The rest of the points above merely serve to illustrate that
&gt; conservatives can't handle good acid, and should probably stick
&gt; to booze.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #6:       BANKRUPT THE GOVERNMENT
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Encourage government extravagance on every front.
&gt; &gt; Get the government deeply into debt. Get the people dependent on
&gt; &gt; government by providing for their every need. This destroys their
&gt; &gt; independence, motivation and strength.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; The United States is flat broke. It is the number one debtor nation on
&gt; &gt; earth, with a deficit of more than $5,000,000,000,000 (five trillion
&gt; &gt; dollars).   Social programs pay for everything from abortion and
&gt; &gt; homosexual-run "sensitivity training sessions" to comprehensive sex
&gt; &gt; education.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are the most truly Socialistic society on earth, a nation
&gt; &gt; of people addicted to entitlements, unable to break away from the ample
&gt; &gt; government teat, people who scream at the top of our lungs if any
&gt; &gt; cutbacks in services are proposed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And yet, the Neoliberals want to spend even more.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They want us to fund family benefits for sodomites, a comprehensive
&gt; &gt; health care plan that will inevitably turn into a Britain-like
&gt; &gt; socialized horror, and "art" that is blatantly obscene.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   I agree with the Dumb Cunt (TM) on this point. We need to fuck
&gt; away our money on billions and billions of dollars of nuclear arms,
&gt; weapons, surveillance equipment, secret agents and assassins, etc.
&gt;   A decent and moral society can only be ensured by buying 10,000
&gt; toilet seats for the Pentagon.
&gt;   (Jesus. You _really_are_ a Dumb Cunt (TM), aren't you?)
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #7:       DESTROY NATIONAL VALUES
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Cause a breakdown of indigenous national values.  Destroy all tradition
&gt; &gt; in preparation for the bright dawn of glorious Socialism.  Ridicule
&gt; &gt; religion, patriotism, and honesty. The people must be led to have only
&gt; &gt; one interest:   Themselves!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; &gt;From the public schools to the pulpits of Christian "churches," moral
&gt; &gt; relativism and situational ethics are the rule of the day. The highest
&gt; &gt; goods are compassion, nonjudgmentalism, and tolerance.
&gt; &gt; Any individual weakness is treated as a problem of society, not of the
&gt; &gt; person, and this relieves everyone of the responsibility of improving
&gt; &gt; themselves.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why should there be any effort to take responsibility for one's own
&gt; &gt; faults when "society" is so conveniently ready to take the blame for all
&gt; &gt; one's sins? Society has made the sacrifice.   So criminals, addicts,
&gt; &gt; alcoholics, child molesters, wife beaters, and others can always blame
&gt; &gt; their problems on society.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We have truly become the "me generation."
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   The Dumb Cunt (TM) is beginning to degenerate into drooling and
&gt; meaningless generalizations which make little sense.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; RULE FOR REVOLUTION #8:       ATTACK GUN OWNERSHIP
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULE:
&gt; &gt; Control or register all firearms if possible. This will make their
&gt; &gt; confiscation much easier when the time comes for revolution.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; When the Communist Revolution occurs in the United States, the last
&gt; &gt; thing the Red Armies want to face is ten million determined and
&gt; &gt; well-trained guerrillas (gun owners) taking potshots at them from around
&gt; &gt; every corner.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Communists don't want the equivalent of ten Afghanistans in the
&gt; &gt; United States.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Although the objective of inhibiting gun ownership has not yet been
&gt; &gt; completely met, there are dozens of bills and initiatives being
&gt; &gt; submitted all over the country for compulsory gun registration,
&gt; &gt; permitting, and other controls.   The Second Amendment is
&gt; &gt; disregarded entirely as Neoliberals trumpet for all guns to be totally
&gt; &gt; banned.
&gt; &gt; After all, they say, thousands die from gun-related accidents and crimes
&gt; &gt; every year. They fail to see that criminals will always get guns, a
&gt; &gt; parallel to their own argument stating that, if abortion becomes
&gt; &gt; illegal, women will still get abortions.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   I guess it was a mistake for the Dumb Cunt (TM) and her right-wing
&gt; bum-buddies to join the left-wing sodomy artists in electing so
&gt; goddamn many Communist gun-snatchers to political office.
&gt;   I think we ought to give Hinkley his gun back, as soon as 
&gt; another Republican is elected President.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; RULES FOR REVOLUTION #9 AND #10:    UNDERMINE THE ARMED FORCES
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE RULES:
&gt; &gt; Destroy the reputation of the armed forces.
&gt; &gt; Cause the young men to perceive military duty as distasteful and
&gt; &gt; ridiculous. Fight registration of any kind, and encourage defections
&gt; &gt; within the ranks.
&gt; &gt; Cause the people to desire peace at any cost.   Cause them to oppose any
&gt; &gt; and all of their government's actions regarding the strengthening or use
&gt; &gt; of their armed forces.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE DUMB CUNT'S OPINION:
&gt; &gt; Our country's armed forces consume a vast percentage of our gross
&gt; &gt; national product.
&gt; &gt; We possess the best and most advanced weapons systems in the world. But
&gt; &gt; our armed forces are a joke for two reasons:
&gt; &gt; (1) they are completely restrained in their actions by a hostile
&gt; &gt; Congress, and
&gt; &gt; (2) the armed forces have been saddled with such a bad reputation that
&gt; &gt; it is virtually impossible to fill the ranks with volunteers, even in
&gt; &gt; the new and streamlined armed services.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Where serving in the armed forces was once considered patriotic and
&gt; &gt; honorable (as it was in the former Soviet Union), it is now looked upon
&gt; &gt; as foolish and 'anti-progressive.'
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Servicemen are ridiculed and denigrated at every turn. People say that,
&gt; &gt; if you can't make it on the outside, you wind up in the armed forces.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Every serviceman is considered to be a useless gobbler of tax money.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   And all of the good soldiers, like Tim McVeigh, end up leaving.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; FINAL REALITY:  WELCOME TO AMERIKA, COMRADES.
&gt; &gt; ================================================================
&gt; &gt; The 'Rules for Revolution' described here are the most important actions
&gt; &gt; that can be taken to weaken a country in order to prepare it for armed
&gt; &gt; attack or a skillful coup d'etat.  These rules are summaries that are
&gt; &gt; extracted from a number of books written by professional revolutionaries
&gt; &gt; from the former Soviet Union, from other Communist-dominated countries,
&gt; &gt; and from the United States itself.
&gt; &gt; They are most concisely summarized in the 2,225 page, three-volume set
&gt; &gt; Lenin: Selected Works , distributed in English by Progress Publishers,
&gt; &gt; 21, Zubovsky Boulevard, Moscow.
&gt; &gt; These general principles, dedicated to one of the most famous
&gt; &gt; revolutionaries of all time, Vladimir Lenin, are studied by every
&gt; &gt; Communist political scientist, and by every ambassador or emissary of
&gt; &gt; any type who leaves the former Soviet Union.  They are also studied in
&gt; &gt; great detail by many Americans.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TRUTHMONGERING VERNACULAR TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE:
&gt;   Vladimir Lenin's best friend in the whole, wide world, is the Dumb
&gt; Cunt (TM) and her Nazi Christian bum-buddies. 
&gt;   The Godless Communists and the Nazi Christians could trade their
&gt; brochures and just interchange the words  "Commie" and "Christian."
&gt; 
&gt;   I wish I had a penny for every Dumb Cunt (TM) and Stupid Prick (TM)
&gt; who spent the majority of their time promoting the very same beliefs
&gt; as those they claim to oppose, the only difference being that their
&gt; 'solution' is the MLM promoting of a 'god' with a different name,
&gt; or a 'flag' with a different 'hang time.'

&gt;   Why does it not come as a surprise that this Dumb Cunt Nazi Christian
&gt; Bitch (TM) is hiding behind 'the children,' hoping that it will prevent
&gt; her from being a target of reprisal for the bullshit she is flinging
&gt; at others?
&gt; 
&gt; Why doesn't someone shoot this Dumb Cunt Nazi Christian Bitch?
&gt; If it saves the life of just one child...
