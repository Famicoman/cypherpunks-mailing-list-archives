&gt; &gt;&gt;If you don't speak up when someone says something objectionable,
&gt; &gt;&gt;you are implicitly condoning it.  Silence gives consent. 

No it does not.  Silence may mean you are to appalled to even post!

&gt; &gt;&gt;How many
&gt; &gt;&gt;people have objected to Tim May's racist comments?  Only one or
&gt; &gt;&gt;two.  How many objected when William Geiger suggested that more
&gt; &gt;&gt;nuclear bombs should have been dropped on Japan? 

Maybe the little marine was right about that.

&gt; &gt;through my archived mail), along the lines of: "I fully expect to
&gt; &gt;wake up some morning and hear that some terrorist nuke has
&gt; &gt;destroyed Washington, D.C. I can't say I'll be crying."
&gt; 
&gt; Try this:

&gt; : For the 3rd or 4th time, I have never advocated terrorism, at
&gt; least not of : a physical sort. I have said I hope to see D.C.
&gt; nuked, which is hardly the : same as "advocating" terrorism in any
&gt; meaningful sense

&gt; You admit here that you've said you hope to see D.C. nuked.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you really hope that D.C. gets nuked?  Do other list readers
&gt; agree?

No way.  But I feel, at times, it's bad enough to be *reading* that 
stuff let alone posting about it!

&gt; How many people would this kill?  Over half a million live in
&gt; the city proper, with millions more in the surrounding areas.  You
&gt; have now said that you would hope to see many of these millions of
&gt; people killed.

I think "nuke DC" has become almost a turn of the phrase, these days.
 
&gt; It is this kind of support for depraved violence which has poisoned
&gt; discourse on this mailing list.  It is unconscionable to support
&gt; such an act of cold-blooded terrorism.
&gt; 
&gt; You're not even the worst.  Other posters have supported this kind
&gt; of sickening violence even more openly.  No one complains. 

OK.  Here I go.  I come down on the complaining side.

&gt; Apparently everyone with an ounce of moral sense has left the list
&gt; long ago.

Nope.  Just lurking.
 
&gt; &gt;&gt;At one time the cypherpunks stood for freedom of speech and
&gt; &gt;&gt;protection of privacy.  Today they stand for guns, violence,
&gt; &gt;&gt;threats of terrorism and murder, racism, homophobia, jingoism.

Those things all go hand in hand.

&gt; &gt;I've been here since the beginning...since before the beginning,
&gt; &gt;actually. And I can tell you that the "political incorrectness" was
&gt; &gt;the same in 1992-4 as now. Perhaps you recall a little thing called
&gt; &gt;Waco that happened around that time? Go back and read the traffic.

I first signed on in 1994.
 
&gt; You seem to think that the only problem with Waco is that the wrong
&gt; innocents were killed.  You have no problem taking out innocents in
&gt; Washington D.C. if it lets you get at your enemies.  You are no
&gt; different from the agents who killed the men, women and children in
&gt; Waco. You have no right to set yourself apart from them.  You are as
&gt; ruthless and violent as the worst of them.
&gt; 
&gt; This list reeks of death and violence.  Apparently there is no
&gt; problem which can't be solved by killing.  Kill the innocents of
&gt; D.C.  Kill the children in the day care center in Oklahoma City. 
&gt; Drop more bombs on Japan.  Cheer the cold-blooded murder of a
&gt; government agent.  Kill the children who scrawl graffiti on your
&gt; mailbox.

Well, I used to say Kill Them All And Let God Sort Them Out back when 
I was in the military.
