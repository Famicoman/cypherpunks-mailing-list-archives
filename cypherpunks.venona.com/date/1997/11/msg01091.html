&gt;   The Eskimos have something like 30 different words for "snow." If you
&gt; or I want to 'talk snow' with an Eskimo, our "method of expression"
&gt; (language) will be affected by the "basic fundamentals" by which our
&gt; differing languages are constructed. If we filter these already obvious
&gt; differences through different medium of communiations (words, pictures,
&gt; ASCII characters, etc.), then the "fundamental issues" will "change
&gt; radically" according to the number and type of filters that our
&gt; communications are interpreted through.
&gt;   500 years from now, my own biases and bigottries will be revealed
&gt; by the stripping away of the current commonly understood methods
&gt; of misdirection by which I attempt to disguise them, as well as
&gt; disguised by the the future misunderstandings of the unique meaning
&gt; that my current commonly understood methods of communication convey
&gt; to those steeped in the the peculularities of our era.
&gt;   i.e. - People drunk on Scotch, 500 years in the future, will
&gt; understand what I just said, whereas even I, myself, am unlikely
&gt; to understand it in the morning, once I sober up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would propose...
&gt; 
&gt;   Thanks, but I don't go that way...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  -  People are people, people are strange
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  -  What makes one person happy is guaranteed to piss somebody else off
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  -  Most people will never figure the first two out even if you tell
&gt; &gt;     them the answers
&gt; 
&gt;   Young and Hettinga are going to be really pissed when they find out
&gt; that you've been dipping into their 'stash'...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm beginning to think your attention span is tuned to those 30 second
&gt; &gt; blip-verts...and who asked? Are the voices back already?
&gt; 
&gt;   Nope. I'm wearing the aluminum foil hat...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Reality is that even when the medium evolves to the point where we
&gt; &gt; &gt; can use it to convey the totality of what we are trying to convey, that
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "convey the totality"? What kind of double-speak bullshit is that?
&gt; 
&gt;   I was hoping that I could slip that one by you.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look junior, the absolutely *ONLY* way to express the 'totality' of an
&gt; &gt; experience is to be the one doing the experience. You can pop all the
&gt; &gt; moddies and daddies you wanna but it's still a pale imitation; a rose it is
&gt; &gt; not in any language. Now unless you have just instantly warped our happy
&gt; &gt; assess into the far flung future we are a long walk from plugging brains
&gt; &gt; together, nic's &amp; protocols not withstanding.
&gt; 
&gt;   Whoa! Sounds like you took a few too many of the 'red' ones...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My suggestion, don't quit your day job, assuming your old enough to have a
&gt; &gt; job. They can't tell you're a dawg on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm a 13 year-old dawg, and I'm not wearing any panties.
