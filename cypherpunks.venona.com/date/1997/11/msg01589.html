&gt;&gt;        It is interesting that while almost the entire body of copyright
&gt;&gt;law deals with materials other then what is to be covered, the industry has
&gt;&gt;enough clout to get their's singled out for the first criminal penalties
&gt;&gt;for violation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        This leaves the bulk of copyrighted material, printed material,
&gt;&gt;photographs and the like open to being stolen as does nizkor for example.
&gt;
&gt;I mentioned this point back when I was on the Cyberia-l list a few years ago.
&gt;
&gt;Some of the law professors on the list were complaining that their
&gt;copyright rights were being violated by the quoting or forwarding of
&gt;articles.
&gt;
&gt;And the major newspapers were sending out threatening letters, which were
&gt;generally heeded by the "offenders."
&gt;
&gt;Well, what about _my_ stuff? (More generally, anybody's stuff.)
&gt;
&gt;Why  does Professor Joe Shmoe or "The New Attleboro Times" have a greater
&gt;claim to "copyright violations" than Fred Nobody?
&gt;
&gt;This is a semi-rhetorical question, as it mostly involves who is willing to
&gt;hire a lawyer to enforce such property claims. But, as M. Frieden notes,
&gt;the deck is stacked in favor of large newspapers, publishers, and even
&gt;professional authors, and is stacked against private individuals and lesser
&gt;authors gaining access to the courts.

&gt;"Some copyrights are more equal than others."

&gt;(Personally, I don't really believe in copyrights.)

        Perhaps but there is something particularly obnoxious to the rule
of law when scum like McVay being able to say to the effect, 'I know I am
stealing from you. Sue me.' 

        It is most clearly a mockery of the law to find his pack of
drooling toadies such as McC using the theft as a juvenile taunt, that some
may set themselves above the law solely upon the grounds of the cost of
civil action. 

        That is something simply not done in civilized society.

The 2nd guarantees all the rest.
