<P>
The Reverend Green had been playing to a full house daily as long
as<BR>
the rain had been falling and the rain had been falling for two
<BR>
weeks. When the kid ducked into the ratty canvas tent there was
<BR>
standing room along the walls, a place or two, and such a heady
reek<BR>
of the wet and bathless that they themselves would sally forth
into<BR>
the downpour now and again for fresh air before the rain drove
them<BR>
in again. He stood with others of his kind along the back wall.
The<BR>
only thing that might have distinguished him in that crowd was
that he<BR>
was not armed.
<P>
Neighbors, said the reverend, he couldnt stay out of these here
<BR>
hell, hell, hellholes right here in Nacogdoches. I said to him,
said:<BR>
You goin to take the son of God in there with ye? And he said:
Oh<BR>
no. No I aint. And I said: Dont you know that he said I will foller
<BR>
ye always even unto the end of the road?
<P>
Well, he said, I aint askin nobody to go nowheres. And I said:
<BR>
Neighbor, you dont need to ask. He's a goin to be there with ye
ever<BR>
step of the way whether ye ask it or ye dont. I said: Neighbor,
you<BR>
caint get shed of him. Now. Are you going to drag him, *him*,
into<BR>
that hellhole yonder?
<P>
You ever see such a place for rain?
<P>
The kid had been watching the reverend. He turned to the man who
<BR>
spoke. He wore long moustaches after the fashion of teamsters
and he<BR>
wore a widebrim hat with a low round crown. He was slightly walleyed
<BR>
and he was watching the kid earnestly as if he'd know his opinion
<BR>
about the rain.
<P>
I just got here, said the kid.
<P>
Well it beats all I ever seen.
<P>
The kid nodded. An enormous man dressed in an oilcloth slicker
had<BR>
entered the tent and removed his hat. He was bald as a stone and
he<BR>
had no trace of beard and he had no brows to his eyes nor lashes
to<BR>
them. He was close on to seven feet in height and he stood smoking
a<BR>
cigar even in this nomadic house of God and he seemed to have
removed<BR>
his hat only to chase the rain from it for now he put it on again.
<P>
The reverend had stopped his sermon altogether. There was no sound
<BR>
in the tent. All watched the man. He adjusted the hat and then
<BR>
pushed his way forward as far as the crateboard pulpit where the
<BR>
reverend stood and there he turned to address the reverend's<BR>
congregation. His face was serene and strangely childlike. His
hands<BR>
were small. He held them out.
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen I feel it my duty to inform you that the
man<BR>
holding this revival is an imposter. He holds no papers of divinity
<BR>
from any institution recognized or improvised. He is altogether
<BR>
devoid of the least qualifications to the office he has usurped
and<BR>
has only committed to memory a few passages from the good book
for the<BR>
purpose of lending to his fraudulent sermons some faint flavor
of the<BR>
piety he despises. In truth, the gentleman standing here before
you<BR>
posing as a minister of the Lord is not only totally illiterate
but is<BR>
also wanted by the law in the states of Tennessee, Kentucky,<BR>
Mississippi, and Arkansas.
<P>
Oh God, cried the reverend. Lies, lies! He began reading<BR>
feverishly from his opened bible.
<P>
On a variety of charges the most recent of which involved a girl
of<BR>
eleven years - I said eleven - who had come to him in trust and
whom<BR>
he was surprised in the act of violating while actually clothed
in the<BR>
livery of his God.
<P>
A moan swept through the crowd. A lady sank to her knees.
<P>
This is him, cried the reverend, sobbing. This is him. The devil.
<BR>
Here he stands.
<P>
Let's hang the turd, called an ugly thug from the gallery to the
<BR>
rear.
<P>
Not three weeks before this he was run out of Fort Smith Arkansas
<BR>
for having congress with a goat. Yes lady, that is what I said.
<BR>
Goat.
<P>
Why damn my eyes if I wont shoot the son of a bitch, said a man
<BR>
rising at the far side of the tent, and drawing a pistol from
his boot<BR>
he leveled it and fired.
<P>
The young teamster instantly produced a knife from his clothing
and<BR>
unseamed the tent and stepped outside into the rain. The kid 
<BR>
followed. They ducked low and ran across the mud toward the hotel.
<BR>
Already gunfire was general within the tent and a dozen exits
had been<BR>
hacked through the canvas walls and people were pouring out, women
<BR>
screaming, folk stumbling, folk trampled underfoot in the mud.
The<BR>
kid and his friend reached the hotel gallery and wiped the water
from<BR>
their eyes and turned to watch. As they did so the tent began
to sway<BR>
and buckle and like a huge and wounded medusa it slowly settled
to the<BR>
ground trailing tattered canvas walls and ratty guyropes over
the<BR>
ground.
<P>
The baldheaded man was already at the bar when they entered. On
the<BR>
polished wood before him were two hats and a double handful of
coins.<BR>
He raised his glass but not to them. They stood up to the bar
and<BR>
ordered whiskeys and the kid laid his money down but the barman
pushed<BR>
it back with his thumb and nodded.
<P>
These here is on the judge, he said.
<P>
They drank. The teamster set his glass down and looked at the
kid<BR>
or he seemed to, you couldnt be sure of his gaze. The kid looked
down<BR>
the bar to where the judge stood. The bar was that tall not every
man<BR>
could even get his elbows up on it but it came just to the judge's
<BR>
waist and he stood with his hands placed flatwise on the wood,
leaning<BR>
slightly, as if about to give another address. By now men were
piling<BR>
through the doorway, bleeding, covered in mud, cursing. They gathered
<BR>
about the judge. A posse was being drawn to pursue the preacher.
<P>
Judge, how did you come to have the goods on that no-account?
<P>
Goods? said the judge.
<P>
When was you in Fort Smith?
<P>
Fort Smith?
<P>
Where did you know him to know all that stuff on him?
<P>
You mean the Reverend Green?
<P>
Yessir. I reckon you was in Fort Smith fore ye come out here.
<P>
I was never in Fort Smith in my life. Doubt that he was.
<P>
They looked from one to the other.
<P>
Well where was it you run up on him?
<P>
I never laid eyes on the man before today. Never even heard of
him.<BR>
He raised his glass and drank.
<P>
There was a strange silence in the room. The men looked like mud
<BR>
effigies. Finally someone began to laugh. Then another. Soon they
<BR>
were all laughing together. Someone bought the judge a drink.

<FONT COLOR=#000000>I would be the last one to deny that those
who have followed the Chronicles of InfoWar and/or my posts to
the CypherPunks mailing list would be justified in concluding
that I am a raving lunatic, suffering from some bizarre form of
psychotic delusion which has yet to be properly researched, defined
and categorized by medical science.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>However, please allow me to say a few words
in my own defense, in the hope of giving you at least a modicum
of insight into the method of my madness, and vice-versa.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>I have lived a life which many people would
consider rather remarkable and, in some aspects, rather unbelievable,
as well. {In reality, 'unusual' is probably a more fitting, though
mundane, description.}<BR>
In order to impress upon you that I am not consciously or (too)
subconsciously attempting to pretentiously portray (or inwardly
deem) myself as some kind of eminent, all-wise, all-seeing guru
or genius at the expense of the individual uniqueness, talents
and value of others, such as yourself, let me state that I truly
recognize, even in my moments of cynicism, egoism, or a plethora
of other human states of consciousness and being, that what I
regard as the absolute wonderment of my own life is no less remarkable
than that of each and every other being sharing this corporeal
and metaphysical existence with me.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>If I were able to single handedly bring about
world-peace upon the earth tomorrow, heal all of the sick and
lame, and make life a proverbial bowl of cherries for all humankind,
I would still regard myself as no more remarkable than any man
or woman who is capable of bringing new life into this world.
<BR>
Anyone who has ever been present at the birth of a child is likely
to understand that I am speaking of the folly of our pretensions
and our posturing, in the face of the genuine mystery of creation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Having said this, let me proceed to attempt
to elucidate the reasons for the sincerity I strive for in writing,
no matter how 'right' or 'wrong' I may be in my beliefs, values
and world-view.<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>My life has been a process of going everywhere,
doing everything, seeing and experiencing an amazing variety of
the reality-bytes that life has to offer.<BR>
Many whom I have come in contact with, who have 'settled down'
to live a life very similar to that of their family, friends and
neighbors, find me to be an interesting   fascinating 'character.'
What many of them do not fully realize is that I find them to
be equally fascinating.<BR>
Despite the wild, far-ranging roller coaster of life I have experienced,
I recognize that it is in no way more reality-encompassing than
the life of someone who has borne and raised a child, or children,
or who have dedicated their life to the pursuit of total understanding
of minute area of the total scheme of reality. I have sometimes
been involved in conversations with people who pour out their
woes, their self-doubts, their regrets of 'roads not taken,' etc.,
and I have said, in reply, &quot;You have raised a wonderful child.
You, and everyone else who has done so deserve a Pulitzer Prize.
No one on the face of the earth, however renowned, has ever done
anything which is superior to what you have accomplished.&quot;

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Everyone has things that they have the background
and ability to <B>do</B> and corresponding life lessons and experience
that they have to share with their fellow terrestrial travelers.
<BR>
What I believe I have to share is the perceptive viewpoint of
someone who has garnered a reasonably objective outlook on the
life and society around them, as a result of having always stood
slightly outside the boundaries of whatever situational reality
they were interacting with at any point in time.<BR>
To illustrate, allow me to point out that I have been through
&quot;The End of the World&quot; &#153; twice, in my lifetime
to date.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The first time was as a baptized member of
Herbert W. Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God. (I am not only
Washed In The Blood Of The Lamb, but I also scrubbed behind my
ears-mom would be proud of me.)<BR>
One of the reasons I still regard the members of the WWCOG very
highly is that during my stay in the church I suffered very little
discrimination or judgment as a result of being vastly different
from almost all other members of the church, in ways that would
have resulted, as a member of most organizations (religious or
secular), in my being the target of coercive attempts at 'changing
me for the better', or [Your Example of Infringement of One's
Right To Self-Determination Here].</FONT>
<P>
Hard to believe that hard-core Christians could be this liberal
(Example # 6):<BR>
&quot;We would rather that you didn't strip naked during church
services, paint yourself blue and stand on your head while chanting
'Allah is good&#133;Allah is great. Hopefully, further Bible study
will lead you to understand that these actions are not necessary
for spiritual development. But, hey! We could be wrong.&quot;
<P>
While you may be chuckling at my humorous representation of what
I am explaining, here, let me assure you that this tongue in cheek
example is no more outlandish than 'the real facts.'
<P>
When &quot;The End of the World&quot; &#153; was announced, church
members made preparations for holing up on the specified date,
having a fantastic 'last meal' and preparing for a final night
of fellowship during which most 'masks' would be dropped (being
as how the last day before the end of all physical existence doesn't
lend itself to being pretentious in the hope of receiving future
benefit from misleading yourself and others).<BR>
{FYI: Yes, I <B>was</B> tempted to make the obvious &quot;going
out with a <B>bang</B> &lt;nod-nod, wink-wink&gt;&quot; suggestions,
all in good humor, but this was one of the few times in my life
that I was able to resist my basic urge to be infantile and immature.}
<P>
After the WWCOG members, including myself, awoke the next morning
to find that it still hurt when they pinched their arm, so this
couldn't possibly be Heaven &#153;, the church went through a
major shake-up, with many members becoming disillusioned and leaving
for browner pastures. Most of those who remained in the church
went through great mental and emotional turmoil in the process
of resolving the dichotomy of remaining a member of a 'True Church'
which had failed the ultimate test of 'infallibility'.<BR>
Not me&#133;
<P>
This is part and parcel of what I am trying to explain as an example
of what I regard as an ability on my part to exercise a great
deal of objectivity, even during my active participation in entering
into membership in a particular or specific belief-system.
<P>
I never, at any time, believed that the proverbial &quot;End of
the World&quot; was imminent. Quite the opposite, in fact, yet
I participated fully in the event.<BR>
Why? When you are a member of a bowling team, you bowl ten frames
because that is what you are there to do, as a member of the team.
That is how those involved keep score and the agreed basis upon
which they judge the results.
<P>
I made no attempt to burst anyone else's bubble while preparing
for an event which I was certain would not occur but, when asked
by other church members, I did not attempt to obfuscate my beliefs
in this regard, instead speaking honestly about my view that the
person reading the road map of the future was not aware of the
concept of magnetic deflection affecting the perception of True
North.<BR>
On the other hand, neither did I negate the possibility that I
might, at the appointed time, be proven wrong, as I found myself
swept up into Heaven &#153;, to be confronted by a Supreme Being
who was wagging a finger at me, saying, &quot;You are going to
find your eternal stay in Heaven considerably more enjoyable if
you drop the cynicism.&quot;
<P>
As a result of having the objectivity which comes from being what
I characterize as &quot;an insider watching from the outside,&quot;
I found that I could observe or participate in the debates between
the 'True Believers' and the 'Disillusioned' and manage to separate
the wheat from the chaff, chiefly because I didn't have a 'position
to defend.'<BR>
i.e.-I hadn't given away my bowling ball (metaphorically speaking)
to charity, out of certitude that I would not be needing it the
following day, so I had no need to 'place blame' on anyone for
my having to buy a new bowling ball for the upcoming tournament.
<P>
Although I ceased actively participating in the WWCOG shortly
after The End of the World &#153; , it was a result of having
already learned and experienced most of those things which I was
there to apperceive.
<P>
In the wake of the World inconsiderately failing to End on schedule,
the titular heads of the Worldwide Church of God rechecked their
figures and, sure enough, realized that they had forgotten to
'carry the three' and that it had been a mistake to use the recently
legislated value of pi (3.0) in their calculations.<BR>
I found this to be very disturbing. <BR>
I personally had absolutely no problem with the World failing
to End as predicted, nor with those who had mistakenly (as it
turned out) made the prediction. My beliefs and core values were
neither strengthened nor weakened by the details of the event-I
am proud to say that I felt no need to paint myself 'green' instead
of 'blue' thereafter, in an attempt to rebuild a non-existent
ivory tower of religious/spiritual belief.
<P>
Had those involved not busied themselves with attempting to pretend
that they were still infallible, but bad at math, my sojourn in
the Worldwide Church of God would have undoubtedly lasted a little
longer. As it was, I felt that there were more precipitous routes
to additional knowledge and learning, since advancement of corporal
and ethereal cognitive capabilities had been put on hold in the
church in the interests of regeneration of structures which were
not truly necessary to the objectives of religious spirituality.
<P>
To tell the truth, I find it rather ironic that intelligent, spiritually
oriented individuals who recognize the foolishness of worshipping
golden calves often fail to recognize that the 'semi-worshipping'
of 'wooden' calves may be a step forward, but is equally foolish,
nonetheless.<BR>
<P>
My participation in the second (non-annual) &quot;End of the World&quot;
&#153; was as a member of the Institute of Applied Metaphysics.
<BR>
The event/process was very similar in concept to the WWCOG &quot;End
of the World&quot; &#153;, with only the circumstantial details
being significantly different.<BR>
i.e. - As a member of IAM, I stripped naked, painted my self <B>purple</B>,
and stood on my head during the meetings, conferences and classes.
<P>
Once again, those involved in &quot;The End of the World&quot;
&#153; awoke the next morning to find that it still hurt when
they pinched their arm (or when I pinched their butt). Again,
there was a certain amount of disillusionment in the wake of continued
corporeal existence, but less so than in the WWCOG, since there
was less of a structured, ritual schematization involved.<BR>
i.e. - more people wearing jeans, fewer people wearing suits and
ties
<P>
I eventually moved on to a divergent path in my quest toward finding
new and better ways to investigate the underlying unity within
the boundaries of diversity, once again taking along the lessons
and experiences I had garnered during my hiatus from constant
motion (as opposed to fleeing from the abomination of human fallibility).
<P>
The wake of this second failure of the World to End according
to schedule was of lesser amplitude than the previous one I had
participated in, rocking the boat of established position/beliefs
less than before. I attribute this to the fact that the response
of the titular heads of the Institute of Applied Metaphysics was
not to 'deny' that there had been no failure, only a slight miscalculation
(PolitiSpeak), but was, instead, to 'reveal' to the participants
that the world had, in fact, come to an end, exactly as predicted.
<BR>
The 'loophole' that validated this Nostradamian spin-doctoring
was that the precise wording of the original prediction was &quot;the
world AS WE KNOW IT will come to an end.&quot;
<P>
{Petty and cynical way to have fun with 'voices pontificating
in the wilderness' when they are so foolish as to give a date
and time to their &quot;End of the World&quot; &#153; prediction:
Ask them if the time quoted is Eastern Time, Pacific Time, or
Greenwich Mean Time.<BR>
NostraCanadaIsis: &quot;The 'End of the World' &#153; will be
at 9:00 p.m. (9:30 p.m. in Newfoundland).
<P>
Definition: Spin Doctoring - You are standing naked in the gas
chamber with a thousand of your fellow ethnic outlaws when the
voice of Herr Himmler blares out from the speakers, &quot;I have
decided to spare your lives.&quot; The loud cheers of yourself
and your grateful ethnological comrades are cut short by the sound
of a deadly gas being released from the ceiling vents. A different
voice comes over the speaker, saying, &quot;What Herr Himmler
<B>meant</B> to say, was&#133;&quot;
<P>
Sick humor? Moi&#133;?<BR>
<P>
The two examples above involve group participation events which
are synchronous with individual examples of 'what I <B>do</B>.'
<P>
Everyone has things which they <B>'do'</B>.<BR>
What I am speaking of here is something which I believe most people
inherently understand, but which is difficult to put into words.
<BR>
i.e. - I can only describe my understanding of the concept I am
expressing, in the hope that you can compare and interpret what
I say in the light of your own knowledge and experience, be it
a translation of what I say into a mathematical equation, an emotional
feeling, a graphical representation, or whatever&#133;
<P>
What some people <B>do</B> is to live a life of optimism which
drives cynical people crazy, particularly in light of the fact
that the history of events in the optimist's life confirms that
his or her world-view is valid.<BR>
What other people <B>do</B> is live a life of cynicism which drives
optimists crazy, in light of the fact that the cynic's observations
and logic are irrefutable, thus forcing the optimist to face the
fact that life is not a bowl of cherries for those whose destiny
is not to reflect the benefits of the power of positive thinking
but, rather, the reality that life is a crap shoot.
<P>
i.e. &lt;squared&gt; - Some people <B>always</B> find a parking
space exactly where they need one, and other people <B>never</B>
find a parking space in the needed spot.<BR>

The &quot;End of the World&quot; &#153; is something that I <B>do</B>.
<BR>
'Participate in' might equally describe what I refer to as 'something
I <B>do</B>', if viewed from the perspective of the interplay
between myself and others.
<P>
To explain, on a one-on-one level of individuality, what I am
speaking of, I should explain that, on occasion, people I know,
vaguely know, or don't know from Adam, will show up on my doorstep,
and spend time with me.<BR>
A total stranger sometimes shows up on my doorstep and, without
a word of explanation, spends several days helping me install
a new carpet, trim my hedges, or whatever I happen to be involved
in at the time. All without saying a word before departing at
some point, never to cross my path again before making their exit
from this mortal plane.<BR>
Or, they may show up and sit in my living room for an hour, a
day, a week, and tell me their life story. &quot;I was very young,
as a child&#133;then, this morning&#133;&quot; Once again, after
they have done whatever it is they needed to do, they depart.
<P>
The common link between the people who enter my life to perform
variations upon the above themes, before moving on, is that they
die a short time later.<BR>
What is the 'explanation of'/'reason for' the process I have just
described? I have some opinions and/or theories in this regard,
but the bottom line is that it does not matter in the least whether
I am correct or incorrect in this regard. The bottom line is that
it is something that I <B>do/'participate in'</B> and experience
has taught me that if I try to interpret the 'true meaning and
purpose' of these events, thereby convincing myself that I have
some imagined 'cause of action' by which I can control/influence
the 'outcome' of the event in a 'proper' manner, everything goes
to hell and takes longer than it would have if I had resisted
the impulse to control/interfere.
<P>
At this point, I would like to point out that many people might
regard the preceding as what Tim May refers to as 'magical thinking'
and that they would, in a certain sense, be right. Tim May has,
in more than a few missives, indicated his disapproval of those
who engage in the 'airy-fairy' process of 'magical thinking,'
in contradiction to the known physical laws of reality.
<P>
I have long regarded Tim May as the original Philosopher King
of the CypherPunks mailing list, and I give considerable weight
to his missives, knowing that they are, for the most part, composed
in a process which involves careful thought and analysis of the
issues or technicalities of whatever topic that his missive is
addressing.<BR>
If my first reading of his post to the CypherPunks list seems
to indicate that he is simply 'on the rag' and 'blowing smoke,'
then I read the post again to see if I am correct in the assumption
that he is having a 'bad hair day,' or if I have my head up my
butt and I am failing to understand what Tim is attempting to
communicate.
<P>
Tim May sometimes comes off, in the context of the not-totally-encompassing-media
of InterNet communication, as a bit of a Redneck/Ugly-American/Materialistically-Grounded/Fuck-the-Hippie-Crystal-Worshipers
kind of guy.<BR>
i.e. - Nuke Magical Thinkers<BR>
However, I think he would be surprised, given my above claims,
to find that I agree with him, for the most part-listen closely-within
the context of his definition of 'magical thinking.'
<P>
However, 'magical thinking' is something that I <B>do</B>, and
I believe that it is valid from within the context of my definition
of what the term truly comprises.<BR>
i.e. - I care not in the least whether you (or I) claim that it
is possible to 'psychically will' the balance of a bank account
to increase by $100.00. My view is that this-or-that claim doesn't
matter in the least. What matters is whether the bank account
does or does not increase.<BR>
<P>
What I am getting at is that, as a mathematician, the certitude
of what you recognize and accept is not dependent on my mathematical
ability to understand the concepts which you know and understand.
My belief that 1 + 1 = 3 is not likely to cause you to come to
the belief that your whole life is a lie, and that you should
kill yourself.<BR>
Why is this? Because mathematics is something that you <B>do</B>.
<P>
Likewise, metaphysics is something that I <B>do</B>.<BR>
What I implore you to understand is that I have no more personal,
emotional investment in a blue aura meaning 'this' as opposed
to 'that', than you, as a mathematician, have in 1 + 1 = 2, as
opposed to 1 + 1 = 3.<BR>
Your concern as a mathematician is that the value you recognize
is valid within the boundaries of the logic system within which
you are working. My concern as a metaphysician is the same.
<P>
In effect, what I am saying is that people, be they friends, acquaintances
or total strangers, show up on my doorstep and do whatever it
is they need to do before departing and going off to reunite with
the Spirit of the Cosmic Muffin, or whatever.<BR>
You don't understand? Me neither&#133;
<P>
Do you believe or disbelieve what I am telling you? Do you think
it is a 'good' thing or a 'bad' thing, if true? Do you think it
is the work of God, or the work of the Devil?<BR>
Pick 'one from Column A and two from Column B', or vice-versa-it's
fine by me. Regardless of your or my belief/disbelief, attitude
or opinion&#133;it happens.
<P>
If you feel the urge to show up on my doorstep and spend the next
few decades helping to prove or disprove what I perceive as reality,
feel free to do so, but I believe that there are probably much
better ways to spend your time.<BR>
<P>
I guess what I am haphazardly attempting to explain is my view
of what objectivity truly means, insofar as I understand the concept
and strive to arrive at an objective, truthful perception of existence,
during my journey through 'madness cleverly disguised as sanity'
(or vice-versa).
<P>
Non-Taoists often perceive those who are journeying in a direction
opposite to, or tangent to, their own vector of impetus as being
'in opposition to' themselves.<BR>
>From a Taoist perspective, however, no one is truly 'going the
<B>wrong </B>way.'
<P>
In effect, it is as if we live in a world where traveling both
North and South are required for survival/enlightenment/whatever.
<BR>
Those who are dimly aware that they are traveling North after
having already fulfilled the 'traveling South' part of the equation,
are likely to subconsciously recognize that those traveling in
the opposite direction may be doing so because have already fulfilled
the 'traveling North' part of the equation. Those who have not
yet traversed the opposite side of the equation are more likely
to believe that those traveling in the opposite direction are
'evil incarnate', actively seeking to subvert the will of the
OneWay True God who rules the 'Turn Left To Go Towards Righteousness'
universe.
<P>
I believe that it might help to clarify the concept I am attempting
to express here if I ask you to think of examples from your own
life, and from the lives of others you have observed, which might
serve to illustrate people who unthinkingly shout &quot;You are
going the wrong way!&quot; to total strangers when, in fact, they
have no idea where the person they are shouting at is coming from,
or going to.<BR>
A parallax example would be a mature person trying to impose the
logic of grownup reasoning on a teenager who is firmly ensconced
in the hormonal grip of a still-growing movement toward balancing
reason and emotion.
<P>
The value that our experience and understanding can play in communicating
with others is directly related to the degree to which we have
recognized, faced and resolved those events and situations in
our life that require us to strike a balance between order and
chaos, individuality and communion with the 'other', stability
and evolution-Yin and  Yang.<BR>
<BR>
Obtuse Parallax Non-Involvement Participation Theory: The fact
that life is a crap shoot in no way detracts from the validity
of 'self-determination through the exercise of free will' playing
an essential part in determining the final outcome of the unfolding
of our predestination.
<P>
{Pretty profound, eh? I wonder if it actually means anything&#133;}
<BR>
<P>
But, seriously&#133;I was very young as a child&#133;
<P>
OK, I'll quit kidding around. (Honest!)<BR>
<P>
Despite the extremely multitudinous verbal effusions which I often
use to convey my understanding of life's realities and peculiarities,
much of what my preceding voluminous asseverations are aimed toward
communicating can be summed up in a two-line poem which was written
by an eccentric schizoid component of my overall persona which
lurks omnipresently behind the scar tissue on the periphery of
my brain, as the result of a failed lobotomy attempt by a well-meaning,
but misguided, member of the Manson family.
<P>
<CENTER><I>&quot;<U>All My Lies Are True</U>&quot;</I></CENTER>
<P>

And everything I do, I really am.<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
In short (but time-and-volume expanded to give you the benefit
of enlightenment through overcoming the confusion of my verbal
obtuseness), there exists-in the heart of the time-space continuum
that is conspiring with extemporaneous metaphysical actuality
to bring us all to a sorry end-two separate and distinct enemies
of the current direction and goals of our lifelong aspirations.
<P>
The first enemy is whatever runs contrary to our beliefs, aims
and purpose in life, and which threatens our existence/being/survival
because  of our failure to recognize its value in our life, due
to the fact that it encompasses arenas of life which we have not
yet had occasion to confront and/or experience.<BR>
The second enemy is the 'friendly enemy' which represents those
arenas of life which we have already traversed, and which constitute
a hazard to the evolution of our consciousness only by virtue
of the fact that it is always tempting to bathe in the glory of
treading familiar ground, deluding ourselves that our competence
in rehashing already-learned lessons in life is a sign of superiority
to those poor souls we pass by as they stumble and fall in their
evolutionary journey through unfamiliar territory.
<P>
For those of you who have consumed less than a quart of Scotch
in the last half-hour, and are thus mystified as to what I am
talking about, here, I will point out that what I have just expressed
might be considered to be the equivalent of those who teach second-grade
math indulging themselves in the bizarre and obscene delusion
that the godlike reverence which the six and seven year old children
impute to them as a result of their superior understanding of
the mysteries of multiplication is somehow reflective of their
innate superiority to the entirety of humanity around them.
<P>
Or, as a parallax example, a school yard bully who considers himself
to be a 'tough guy', despite the fact that he is six-foot eight,
two hundred and forty five pounds, forty three years of age, and
is still in the third grade.<BR>
[No, asshole, this example is <B>not</B> based on my own life
experience.]<BR>
<P>
As you may have already guessed, I have pretty much lost track
of what the hell it is I had originally intended to communicate
in this duplicitous soliloquy concerning the divine triad of incremental
quaternion.<BR>
So perhaps it is best that I toss my Thesaurus in the trash and
entrust to my limited lexicon the responsibility of conveying
an important, though insipid, axiom of life which should serve
as an shining beacon which has the capacity to enlighten the waters
beyond the rocky shores of my limited attention span, and open
the door to a complete understanding of how to properly interpret
and evaluate the Chronicles of InfoWar.
<P>
In other words-in plain English-articulating my unknown thoughts
in a manner which accurately expresses my lack of social skills
and my disposition toward not really giving a fat rat's ass if
my efforts at elocution are appreciated, or whether I am just
pissing in the wind&#133;<BR>
I am the living, breathing incarnation of the Jules Pfiefer  elucidation
of the &quot;Mad Dog in possession of the last false smile.&quot;
<P>
I AM the TruthMonger.
<P>
If you think that my irreverence, sick humor, and my propensity
toward expressing myself in a manner which will lead those reading
my mad ramblings to conclude that I am an uncouth, insane asshole
is an indication that I am not totally sincere in seeking to share
the enlightenment that it has been my blessing to experience during
the course of my life, then Fuck You!
<P>
We are all born into a predestined domain wherein our role as
a warrior is to fight the battles which can be waged by none other
than ourselves.<BR>
My predestined battle is to rail loud and long against the anal-retentive
scourge of counterfeit substantiality which we and our fellow
anthropological sycophants kneel in obeisance to, for lack of
true belief in the primacy of our sovereign franchise which not
only deems us to be the captain of our ship of life and master
of our ultimate destiny, but which also <B>demands</B> that we
recognize our divinity and our obligation to throw off the bondage
of  outside authority, accepting total responsibility for living
our life according to the dictates of our conscience and our innate
soul pattern.<BR>
<P>
