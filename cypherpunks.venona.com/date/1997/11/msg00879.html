Addressing Tim May, Anonymous &lt;nobody@replay.com&gt; wrote:
&gt;Do you really hope that D.C. gets nuked?  Do other list readers
&gt;agree?  How many people would this kill?  Over half a million live in
&gt;the city proper, with millions more in the surrounding areas.  You
&gt;have now said that you would hope to see many of these millions of
&gt;people killed.

There is probably a double standard in play here.  (BTW, one advantage
of persistent identity is that it creates a context for the discussion
which makes it possible to explore deeper ideas.)

Very few people eschew violence completely or are overly troubled by
the deaths of innocents in the process...

&gt;You're not even the worst.  Other posters have supported this kind of
&gt;sickening violence even more openly.  No one complains.  Apparently
&gt;everyone with an ounce of moral sense has left the list long ago.

..so when you claim that nobody with any moral sense would favor
violence, you have essentially declared that most of the human race is
without moral sense.  It's an interesting proposition, but it is by no
means obvious that it is true.

Also, it is puzzling that you have singled out a few subscribers to
this list for attention.  There are literally millions of people all
over the globe who are actively involved with planning and executing
horrible acts of violence.  In this company, the readers of this list
are pretty insignificant.  I do not know of a single act of violence
associated with any list member.  In practice, you would be hard
pressed to find a more peaceful group anywhere in the world.

One of the things that appeals to me about the tools the cypherpunks
are developing is the likelihood that they will end war.  What
percentage of wars are instigated and organized by governments?  That
is, how many wars can we think of in which a war originated in the
population of country and dragged its unwilling government into the
fray?  I cannot think of any.
