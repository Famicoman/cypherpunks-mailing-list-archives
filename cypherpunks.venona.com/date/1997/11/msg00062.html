Well, first of all I was being facetious, because of how people are always
saying we need Leadership (tm) and need to elect another President in order
to have a more Perfect Union.   But I said we need a "good" lawyer - a
libertarian lawyer - because I expect that it would take someone who had
studied the legal system and made it their project to be well-educated and
articulate on these matters, to be able to successfully represent the
Consitutional values which we subscribe to.   Maybe not.  I myself don't
think I could do it, although I would lend all kinds of backend support to
whoever would, and frankly I don't think I would select you, either, Jim,
because I don't think your arguments would be effective.   I would be
thrilled if someone like Tocqueville existed.   He would get my vote.

&gt;Has there ever been a law suite brought against the Supreme Court or
&gt;Congress claiming their actions were unconstitutional? The amendment
&gt;relating to taxation for a start, repeal individual taxation and return to
&gt;the system originaly intended by the founding fathers. 

I don't know.   But this is the sort of issue I was thinking of.

&gt;Also, let's start something relating to the 2nd. We should also move to [.
. . ]

Okay, you first. heh.  You're being quite free with your recommendations.
Remember, right now we're just a bunch of people sitting around their
computers talking.  Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
