&gt; Subject: Re: Further costs of war (fwd)

&gt; While I have no love for the japs, I mus point out in all fairness that
&gt; FDR was attacking them on all fronts for years: 1) stopping the japs
&gt; from immigrating into the us, 2) cutting off their supplies of raw
&gt; materials (and therefore pushing the japs to conquer the territories
&gt; that would assure the supply). In particular, right before the japs
&gt; attacked pearl harbor, the US embargoed oil shipments to the japs.
&gt; The japs had said previously that they'd consider such an embargo
&gt; as a declaration of war. In particular, their line about p.h. was
&gt; that it wasn't a "sulplise attack", and that the US had previously
&gt; declared war on the japs by imposing the embargo.

The Japanese joined the Tri-partite on Sept. 27, 1940. 5 days later it began
its first attacks in Indo-china, 13 months prior to the attack on Pearl
Harbor. America was shocked by these acts and interpreted them as openly
hostile and tended to strengthen Chian Kai-shek's claims as the legitimate
Chinese authority. Prior to this signing Japanese forces had advanced up the
Kowloon Peninsula to glair through the wire at Hong Kong. Tokyo demanded the
British close the Burma Road and cease all war material trade with China. The
British requested the Americans invoke a general embargo as well as moving
naval forces to the western Pacific. The Americans rejected all these
suggestions. They had moved the Pacific Fleet from the West Coast to Pearl
Harbor. Because of the upcoming election it was felt that such actions would
be interpreted as support for the British colonialism which was politicaly
unacceptable to much of America. The British responded by offering to close
the Burma Road for 3 months (during the monsoon season when there was little
traffic to interrupt). Only in July of 1940, 2 months before Japan signed the
act, did Roosevelt finaly put an embargo in place which covered aviation fuel,
lubricants, and certain scrap iron and steel. In September the regulations
were tightened. Only in Nov. after being re-elected did he include copper,
zinc, brass, oil-drilling equipment, and other strategic materials.

It's important to note that as early as January 1941 the Emporer had ordered
Yamamoto to review the attack on Hawaii. Presumably because he felt
uncomfortable with the entire thing.

So the time line is something like this:

15 months prior to Pearl Harbor the US places an embargo on Japan presumably
because of their aggressive policies.

13 months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor the Japanese sign the
Tri-partite Act.

12 months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor the Emporer gets cold feet
and orders a review of the plan.

&gt; My recollection is that Hitler's generla staff was busily designing the
&gt; plans for invading the US, to be implemented after he  was done with
&gt; the GB and the USSR. They involved invading via his latin american
&gt; allies (notably mexico) and possibly canada. However there was no
&gt; way to sell the war against germany to the american public, except
&gt; as part of a package deal with the war on japs.

Actualy at the time, German invasion through Mexico was felt to be a real
possibility. There was significant build-up of both covert agents in Mexico
as well as military forces along the border during this time.

Note, I would appreciate any references to the regulation of Japanese
nationals transiting through or applying for residence in the US during this
period. Can't say that I've ever seen this issue in anything I've read.
