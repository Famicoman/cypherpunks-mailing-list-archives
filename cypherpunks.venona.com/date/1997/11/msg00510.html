This is an interesting spin doctoring of Jim Bell's situation.  I picked
this up off the psychoceramics list.  Why it was there is unclear...

&gt;&gt;From <A  HREF="http://www.usnews.com:80/usnews/issue/971117/17weap.htm">http://www.usnews.com:80/usnews/issue/971117/17weap.htm</A>

&gt;Terrorism's next waveNerve gas and germs are the new weapons of choice
&gt; BY DAVID E. KAPLAN
&gt;
&gt;Jeff Gordon thought he had seen it all. A veteran IRS investigator,
&gt;Gordon's job since 1988 had been to probe threats and assaults against
&gt;his fellow agents. There was no shortage in recent years--stabbings,
&gt;fires, mortar attacks, and big unexploded bombs outside IRS offices in
&gt;Los Angeles and Reno, Nevada. But in the first months of this year,
&gt;Gordon found himself working on the strangest case of his career. From
&gt;an informant, he had learned of a Portland, Ore., man named James Dalton
&gt;Bell. Bell owed some $30,000 in back taxes and served as a juror in a
&gt;local "common law court." Dozens of these self-appointed tribunals have
&gt;issued "fines" and even death sentences against public officials.
&gt;Bell was also active in antigovernment forums on the Internet, where he
&gt;had posted a dark scheme threatening murder of troublesome federal
&gt;agents. Participants could send encrypted messages to each other, Bell
&gt;proposed, offering donations to whoever "predicted" how long a targeted
&gt;official would live. The winner, presumably the assassin, would be
&gt;rewarded with electronic fund transfers from anonymous donors, 
&gt;hesuggested.
&gt;Gordon checked further. Bell, it turned out, was an electronics engineer
&gt;at a nearby circuit board manufacturer. He was also an MIT-educated
&gt;chemist who had been arrested eight years earlier for making
&gt;methamphetamine, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. According to
&gt;court records, Bell had once told a friend: "The first thing to remember
&gt;is: Never make a chemist angry at you."
&gt;In February, the IRS docked Bell's wages and seized his 10-year-old car.
&gt;Inside the vehicle, Gordon found instructions for making bombs and
&gt;molotov cocktails. There was also far-right literature, a printout
&gt;listing large amounts of cyanide, and detailed information on
&gt;fertilizer, a key ingredient in the Oklahoma City bomb. But with no
&gt;evidence that Bell had hurt anyone, Gordon could not move.
&gt;A burning stench. Four weeks later, on a Monday morning in March, IRS
&gt;officials encountered a terrible nose-burning stench as they arrived at
&gt;their building in Vancouver, the Portland suburb where Bell lived.
&gt;Investigators traced the smell to a welcome mat dosed with propanethiol.
&gt;The chemical is used by utilities in minuscule concentrations to give
&gt;natural gas its noticeable smell. "It's Bell," Gordon told his boss.
&gt;"I'm sure of it." Bell had attempted twice to buy propanethiol from a
&gt;chemical-supply company in Milwaukee, Gordon then learned. Worried that
&gt;the stink bomb was a trial run for something much worse, on April 1,
&gt;authorities raided Bell's home. They seized five computers and three
&gt;semiautomatic assault rifles, then opened his garage door. Before them
&gt;stood dozens of containers filled with chemicals. There were volatile
&gt;solvents, explosives ingredients, sodium cyanide, nitric acid, and
&gt;diisopropyl fluorophosphate--one of several ingredients that, if
&gt;properly mixed, form nerve gas--all in a residential neighborhood. "The
&gt;level and type of chemicals were extremely unusual," said Leroy
&gt;Loiselle, who managed the cleanup for the Environmental Protection
&gt;Agency. "You don't need nitric acid to keep aphids off your flowers."
&gt;On Bell's computers, Gordon found two other items: the names and home
&gt;addresses of over 100 public officials--IRS employees, FBI agents, local
&gt;police officers--and a 169-page document, The Terrorist's Handbook, with
&gt;detailed instructions for making chemical weapons and high explosives.
&gt;Bell's friends told investigators that he had tried using green beans to
&gt;make botulin toxin, which causes botulism, and that he claimed to have
&gt;successfully made sarin, the nerve gas used by Japanese cultists in
&gt;their 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway.
&gt;Bell was arrested. In July he pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction
&gt;of IRS agents and use of a false Social Security number, and also
&gt;admitted to the stink bomb attack and the cyberassassination scheme. He
&gt;faces up to eight years in prison and $500,000 in fines. Bell declined
&gt;to comment, but he contended earlier that he is merely "a chemical
&gt;hobbyist" and the assassination scheme only an abstract proposal. "I'm a
&gt;talker, not a doer," he said. The IRS's Jeff Gordon remains wary.
&gt;According to court records, after his arrest Bell boasted to a friend
&gt;that police never found his most dangerous chemical weapons. Gordon
&gt;believes they could include a secret stockpile of sarin.
&gt;New generation. Characters like James Dalton Bell are giving federal
&gt;officials fits these days. Bell, they believe, is one of a new
&gt;generation of tinkerers and technicians, of college-educated extremists
&gt;threatening to use biological, chemical, or radiological weapons to
&gt;achieve their goals. Since the Aum cult's Tokyo nerve gas attack, FBI
&gt;officials say the number of credible threats to use these weapons has
&gt;jumped from a handful in 1995, to 20 last year, to twice that number
&gt;this year. Among the incidents was the 1995 mailing of a videotape to
&gt;Disneyland, showing two hands mixing chemicals and a note threatening an
&gt;attack on the theme park. Despite a major investigation, the sender was
&gt;never caught. Just last April someone sent a petri dish labeled anthrax,
&gt;an animal disease deadly to humans, to the B'nai B'rith headquarters in
&gt;Washington, D.C. That proved to be a hoax.
&gt;But other threats appear to be quite real. Four militia members in
&gt;Minnesota were convicted recently of planning to assassinate federal
&gt;agents with a biological toxin. In Ohio in 1995, a white supremacist
&gt;pleaded guilty to wire fraud in illegally obtaining three vials of
&gt;bubonic plague bacteria. Investigators have found biochemical agents in
&gt;the hands of political extremists, extortionists, murderers, and the
&gt;mentally ill. U.S. News has learned that the FBI has 50 current
&gt;investigations of individuals suspected of using or planning to use
&gt;radiological, biological, or chemical agents. Bureau officials say a
&gt;major attack in the United States no longer seems unlikely. "The
&gt;consensus of people in the law enforcement and intelligence communities
&gt;is that it's not a matter of if it's going to happen, it's when," warns
&gt;Robert Blitzer, head of the FBI's terrorism section. "We are 
&gt;veryconcerned."
&gt;To prepare, federal agencies have scrambled to set up new
&gt;counterterrorism strike forces (story, Page 32). Behind all this is the
&gt;very real fear that the world has entered a new stage in terrorism.
&gt;Widespread technical education and high-tech communications have vastly
&gt;increased the number of people with knowledge of how to synthesize
&gt;chemicals and culture bacteria. Books and videos on creating these
&gt;substances--and turning them into weapons--are now available on the
&gt;Internet, at gun shows and survivalist fairs, and through the mail.
&gt;While its effects would be the most destructive, a nuclear incident is
&gt;actually the least likely scenario, according to security experts. More
&gt;likely, they say, would be a biological weapon attack; a chemical attack
&gt;is the next likely possibility. The impact could range from the
&gt;poisoning of an individual to sophisticated attempts at mass murder. So
&gt;far, the majority have been limited efforts by loners or small groups.
&gt;Most worrisome to officials is the possible involvement of more
&gt;established, state-sponsored terrorist organizations--such as
&gt;Hezbollah--with international reach.
&gt;While the number of terrorist attacks, both in the United States and
&gt;abroad, has gone down since the end of the cold war, there is a flip
&gt;side. Individual acts themselves have grown more deadly, as illustrated
&gt;by the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. In its annual
&gt;terrorism report issued last April, the State Department sees a trend
&gt;"toward more ruthless attacks on mass civilian targets" and the use of
&gt;more powerful weapons.
&gt;Threshold crossed. Until this decade, biological and chemical weapons
&gt;were the province of superpowers or renegade states like Iraq and North
&gt;Korea. But all that changed with Aum Supreme Truth, an obscure sect of
&gt;New Age fanatics based at the foot of Mount Fuji, 70 miles outside
&gt;Tokyo. Recent court testimony from sect members shows how the cult's
&gt;young scientists produced not only anthrax and botulin toxin but also
&gt;various nerve agents, including the sarin used on Tokyo's subway. Later
&gt;attacks were planned for New York and Washington, D.C.
&gt;Still, it is one thing to produce deadly agents and another to use them
&gt;effectively. Aum's attack killed only 12 people of the thousands in the
&gt;subway system, and on seven other occasions, attempted Aum attacks were
&gt;dogged by equipment failures and human error. "Trying to produce 100,000
&gt;casualties is much more difficult than is often stated," observes
&gt;Jonathan Tucker of the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
&gt;Tucker notes that problems abound with delivery systems, meteorological
&gt;conditions, and the agents themselves. Still, he warns that even crude
&gt;weapons can easily cause mass disruption. Aum's nerve gas, for example,
&gt;was full of impurities, yet it sent thousands to the hospital.
&gt;What worries police is growing evidence that others share similar
&gt;ambitions. In 1993, two years before the Aum attack, Canadian border
&gt;agents stopped an American electrician named Thomas Lavy and searched
&gt;his car. They found four guns, 20,000 rounds of ammunition, 13 pounds of
&gt;gunpowder, neo-Nazi literature, and $80,000 in cash. Lavy also had
&gt;recipes for biological and chemical weapons and a plastic bag filled
&gt;with white powder. Had the agents opened the bag, they likely would have
&gt;died of respiratory failure and paralysis. Tests showed the substance to
&gt;be ricin, a lethal toxin extracted from the castor bean plant. (Ricin,
&gt;dabbed on a tiny pellet fired from an umbrella-gun, was used by Soviet
&gt;agents to murder a Bulgarian in London in 1978.) The poison is 6,000
&gt;times more toxic than cyanide, and there is no antidote. Lavy had a
&gt;quarter pound of the stuff.
&gt;In 1995, a man named Larry Wayne Harris was arrested after he obtained
&gt;vials of the bacteria that cause bubonic plague (Page 28). Harris is an
&gt;Ohio microbiologist and recent member of the white supremacist Aryan
&gt;Nations. He says his friends will strike at government officials with
&gt;biochemical weapons, if provoked. "If they arrest a bunch of our guys,
&gt;they get a test tube in the mail," he told U.S. News. And, he says, far
&gt;worse could come. "How many cities are you willing to lose before you
&gt;back off?" he asks. "At what point do you say: `If these guys want to go
&gt;off to the Northwest and have five states declared to be their own free
&gt;and independent country, let them do it'?" Authorities take Harris's
&gt;comments seriously.
&gt;The recipes for such poison cocktails are available from underground
&gt;publishers and on the Internet. One popularizer is an Arkansan named
&gt;Kurt Saxon. Through books and videotapes, Saxon has been putting out
&gt;ricin recipes for at least nine years. Convinced that the U.S. will be
&gt;invaded and that the federal government can't be trusted to defend the
&gt;country, he has fashioned various homemade explosives and poisons,
&gt;including cyanide grenades and ricin applicators. In one segment of a
&gt;$19.95 video, Saxon performs like a sinister Julia Child, blending salt
&gt;water and solvents with castor beans. ("Pour in about 4 ounces of
&gt;acetone," he says, "and shake it up nice.") "Uncle Fester," another
&gt;near-legendary figure in the chem-bio underground, has authored such
&gt;family classics as Silent Death, Improvised Explosives, and a guide to
&gt;methamphetamine and LSD manufacture. Fester claims degrees in chemistry
&gt;and biology, and his Silent Death describes how to produce poison gas,
&gt;botulin and shellfish toxins, and ricin.
&gt;Similarly, entire manuals for making homemade explosives--TNT, plastic,
&gt;napalm--can be downloaded from the Net, as well as plans for building
&gt;triggers, fuses, and timers. At least 11 online vendors offer books with
&gt;recipes on biological or chemical weapons, including Silent Death and
&gt;Kurt Saxon's The Poor Man's James Bond. All are based in the United
&gt;States. Adding to the problem, many of the chemicals used to make nerve
&gt;gas and other agents have perfectly legitimate uses and are readily
&gt;available. "The genie has always been out of the bottle," says one
&gt;intelligence analyst. "People are just discovering it."
&gt;The genie is also loose in the Middle East. According to intelligence
&gt;sources, notebooks and computer files recently seized from Hezbollah,
&gt;the Iranian-backed Islamic militia, contain information on how to
&gt;produce chemical agents. Hezbollah has also taken delivery of protective
&gt;gear, including gas masks and bodysuits, and obtained Katyusha rockets
&gt;able to deliver chemical warheads to Israel from their base in Lebanon.
&gt;Hezbollah's interests are shared by at least one other Islamic
&gt;terrorist, Ramzi Yusef, a trained engineer and reputed mastermind of the
&gt;1993 World Trade Center bombing. Yusef's organization researched making
&gt;sarin and reportedly planned to assassinate President Clinton in the
&gt;Philippines with phosgene gas. The trade center bombers also packed
&gt;cyanide into the charge that rocked the building; the chemical
&gt;apparently evaporated in the explosion.
&gt;Some analysts believe there have been other, unnoticed, attacks in the
&gt;United States. "It's almost certain there have been uses of biological
&gt;agents that have gone undetected," says Seth Carus, a proliferation
&gt;expert at the National Defense University. "Most cases are known because
&gt;they came to the attention of law enforcement through informants, not
&gt;because of medical authorities." Health officials, for example, were
&gt;mystified by a mass outbreak of salmonella poisoning in Oregon in 1984.
&gt;The cause--an attack by a nearby religious sect--went undetected until
&gt;the cult's demise a year later.
&gt;Exotic poisons are attracting not only terrorists but also murderers and
&gt;extortionists. Several recent trials have featured ricin as a murder
&gt;weapon. Product tamperers, too, are increasingly turning to biological
&gt;agents. Says Lori Ericson of Kroll Information Services: "We're seeing
&gt;E. coli, cholera, salmonella, HIV." In one British case, microbiologist
&gt;Michael Just threatened to contaminate the products of five food
&gt;companies with dysentery-causing bacteria. To make his point, he sent
&gt;the firms test tubes filled with the pathogen.
&gt;Society can likely tolerate the occasional murderer or extortionist
&gt;wielding biological or chemical weapons. The greater challenge
&gt;undoubtedly will come from those with broader grievances, from
&gt;terrorists steeped in extremism and political hatred. Perhaps scariest
&gt;of all are the criminally insane, who may bring technical ability, but
&gt;little judgment, to their homemade laboratories. Last April, authorities
&gt;raided the house of one Thomas Leahy in Janesville, Wis. Leahy, who
&gt;takes medication for schizophrenia, was obsessed with creating "killer
&gt;viruses" to stop his enemies, both real and imagined, according to
&gt;police. He pleaded guilty to possessing ricin, but a search of his home
&gt;also found animal viruses and vaccines, staph bacteria culture,
&gt;fungicides, insecticides, hypodermic needles, and gas masks. As Leahy
&gt;reportedly told his wife, you can "never have too many poisons."
