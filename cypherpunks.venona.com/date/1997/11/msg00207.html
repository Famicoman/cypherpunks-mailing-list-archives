I have worked out a plan whereby we can auction off the role of
Cypherpunks Chief Spokesperson in order to fund CAP's.
The idea for a Spokesperson pyramid scheme came to me after
realizing that the list has not only a variety of individuals
competing as the chief list 'Fed baiters', but also quite a
number of people who enjoy 'Christian baiting', as well:

TruthMonger, playing with his private parts, wrote:
&gt;  Why does it not come as a surprise that this Dumb Cunt Nazi Christian
&gt; Bitch (TM) is hiding behind 'the children,' hoping that it will prevent
&gt; her from being a target of reprisal for the bullshit she is flinging
&gt; at others?
&gt; Why doesn't someone shoot this Dumb Cunt Nazi Christian Bitch?
&gt; If it saves the life of just one child...

Eric Cordian spit out:
&gt; "Puritanism" might be defined as the fear that someone, somewhere, is
&gt; having a porn-induced orgasm.  Stable people tend to worry about their
&gt; own orgasms, and not their neighbors.  Perhaps if you had a few
&gt; orgasms yourself, you might lose interest in the orgasms of others.
&gt; [Nonsense Deleted]
&gt; Please bite my enormous throbbing love sausage with an ice cube in your
&gt; mouth. 

Jesus Christ wrote:
&gt; If you will check the Biblical Archives, I think you will find
&gt; that Peter never really fooled anyone, either.
&gt;  {Speaking of which, do you also plan to censor the parts of the
&gt;   Bible which quote my use of the word, "cock?"}

There is no telling how much money we could raise by appealing to
the macho male egos on the list who lock horns in CypherPissing 
cock-size wars, if we were to take bids on the honor of being the
Cypherpunks' authorized 'Fed-baiter' or 'Christian-pisser', etc.

Given the wide variety of individuals, groups, organizations, 
corporations, government agencies, etc., which have been the
target of vicious attacks on this list, there is no end of the
number of CypherPisser Ambassadorships we could invent to fill
the Cypherpunks Action Projects coffers.

Cypherpunks Chief MLM Spokesman
