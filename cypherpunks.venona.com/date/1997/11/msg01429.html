Yep. Or, as Bob likes to say:

"Well, spank me dry. I do feel like I've got a "kick me" sign on my back or
something.... Ding! You rang? Welcome to Random Acts of Kindness, Inc....I
do think my own powers of hucksterism are improving, though.... I just blew
Diet Coke out of my nose again."

&gt;You've taken Tim's comments out of context and done yeoman work
&gt;for the enemy. If (or when) they ever find an excuse to bother
&gt;him, they won't be showing _his_ posts to the jury -- they'll
&gt;be showing _yours_, you clueless fuckwit.

Yes. Bob claims to be an "ex-liberal," but he shows himself to be just
another bleeding heart, there-ought-to-be-a-law, simp wimp.


&gt;If you had two brain cells to rub together you would have
&gt;taken your lumps in Tim's first brushoff and shut up. He's
&gt;got a right to his position and you haven't got shit. What

And, hackneyed though this may sound, I didn't even _start_ this thing! In
fact, the last few major "Bob vs. Tim" wars have been triggered solely by
Bob. He got overexercised that I didn't care to give a "keynote" at his Mac
Crypto cheerleading party, and wrote a vicious, over the top, rant that
even Lucky Green reacted to by saying "Get back on your Ritalin!"

This rant, called "Watching the MacRubble Bounce" (or somesuch) viciously
attacked me. And also one of his business associates, a thinly veiled
longtime Cypherpunk.

I mostly skip Hettinga's "e$-rants," as they are long on "creative writing"
chops, or so he thinks, and short on substance.


&gt;No, Grasshopper, it is just a _little_ paranoid to suggest
&gt;that it might be a possibility. You're putting words in
&gt;Tim's mouth again. You can probably assume that if Tim
&gt;were really convinced that that were going to happen, they
&gt;would find only an inflatable Tim sitting in front of a
&gt;'puter relaying email through an indirect dial link. Or
&gt;something like that. He's just concerned. I'm concerned.
&gt;Anyone with a brain above room temperature is concerned.
&gt;Ugly things are in the wind.

Yep, again. Ugly things are in the wind. Hettinga can rant about his
"geodesic economies," but the clampdowns are continuing. Too many to list
here.

I am still hopeful, longterm, but we may have to go through some dark,
ugly, periods of war. And in this war, we know who the enemy is.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; to attempt to force a confrontation in hopes of
&gt;&gt; preciptating a revolution, or even gratuitous publicity
&gt;
&gt;Why, Grasshopper! He's done no such thing and you well know it.
&gt;You are the one making such characterizations (as if any of
&gt;us needed that). Had I the time and the interest, I would
&gt;check what archives there are to see if you did the same
&gt;favor for Jim Bell.  Fuckwit!
&gt;
&gt;Well, there's more, but your time's up. See you in the camps.
&gt;
&gt;We Jurgar Din

Amen.
