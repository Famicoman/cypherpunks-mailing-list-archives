                           Internet Books Editor's Recommended Book,
                           11/01/97:
                           For all the talk about the Internet's very real
security weaknesses,
                           information safety is not all that difficult to
achieve. Yes, most
                           Internet technology does a better job of making
information
                           accessible than it does of protecting privacy.
Still, modern
                           cryptographic products and techniques have made
more than
                           adequate security available to just about
anyone who needs it. In
                           Internet Cryptography, network security
consultant Richard
                           Smith explains the basics of online security.
He avoids getting
                           technical with too much cryptographic theory or
the mathematics
                           behind the magic. Instead he focuses on
providing just enough
                           information to enable information systems
managers and
                           administrators to make wise decisions. In fact,
Smith pays close
                           attention to matters of system configuration
and operation,
                           showing how even the best encryption methods
can be ruined by
                           careless operation. From there, Smith explains
how today's
                           techniques can protect information from being
forged, altered, or
                           stolen. Smith devotes most of his discussion of
various
                           cryptographic options to products that are
presently on the
                           market. Therefore, the techniques he describes
are generally
                           within the reach of most businesses and
organizations. He
                           progresses from the simplest to most complex
approach,
                           examining the strengths and weaknesses of each.
As a result,
                           readers wind up with a solid understanding of
cryptographic
                           security as well as a good feel for the level
of security they
                           require. 

                           Book Description :
                           "This book provides an excellent overview of
how encryption is
                           used, its strengths and weaknesses, and what to
look for when
                           building or choosing real-world solutions. This
is a must-have
                           book for anyone considering the deployment of
an important
                           system relying on modern cryptography." -
Marcus J. Ranum,
                           Chief Scientist, V-ONE Corporation.

                           Here, in one comprehensive, soup-to-nuts book,
is the solution
                           for Internet security: modern-day cryptography.
Written by a
                           security expert with a wealth of practical
experience, this book
                           covers network and Internet security in terms
that are easy to
                           understand, using proven technology, systems,
and solutions.
                           From the client workstation to the Web host to
the e-mail server,
                           every aspect of this important topic is
examined and explained.
                           The once-daunting subject of cryptography is
demystified and
                           applied to today's security challenges. Topics
include: essentials
                           of cryptography; networking and Internet
fundamentals;
                           encryption building blocks; virtual private
networks; legal
                           considerations; setting realistic security
objectives; secured
                           electronic mail; World Wide Web transaction
security; and
                           Internet Firewalls.

                           This book is written for people who want to
move data safely
                           across the Internet and protect corporate
resources from
                           unauthorized access. Using real-life case
studies, examples, and
                           commercially available software products,
cryptography is
                           presented as a practical solution to specific,
everyday security
                           challenges.
