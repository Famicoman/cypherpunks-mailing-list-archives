&gt;  FREEDOM WRITER PRESS RELEASE
&gt;
&gt;  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 28, 1997
&gt;  CONTACT: Skipp Porteous (413) 528-3800
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Robertson advocates stoning for UFO
&gt;  enthusiasts
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Great Barrington, MA -- In a recent
&gt;  pronouncement, television evangelist and
&gt;  head of the Christian Coalition, Pat
&gt;  Robertson, advocated death by stoning for
&gt;  UFO enthusiasts.
&gt;
&gt;  Freedom Writer magazine, in its July/August
&gt;  issue, mailed today, disclosed Robertson's
&gt;  statement. Freedom Writer is published by
&gt;  the Institute for First Amendment Studies,
&gt;  a group that monitors the right.
&gt;
&gt;  Robertson used the news of the July 4th
&gt;  Mars landing to promote his extreme
&gt;  beliefs. A segment on the July 8, 1997
&gt;  broadcast of The 700 Club featured news of
&gt;  the Mars Pathfinder mission. Employing the
&gt;  historical event as a starting point, the
&gt;  program delved into the possibility of the
&gt;  existence of UFOs and space aliens.
&gt;
&gt;  While Robertson viewed the space program
&gt;  with suspicion, on a more serious note, he
&gt;  launched into a diatribe against those who
&gt;  entertain the existence of space aliens and
&gt;  UFOs. He said, in a rambling discourse, that
&gt;  if such things exist, they are simply demons
&gt;  trying to lead people away from Christ.
&gt;  According to Robertson, the threat is so
&gt;  serious that people who believe in space
&gt;  aliens should be put to death by stoning --
&gt;  according to "God's word."
&gt;
&gt;  "The Bible says the Earth belongs to man,
&gt;  but the heavens belong to the Lord,"
&gt;  Robertson said.
&gt;
&gt;  "He has given us the Earth. He also warned,
&gt;  way back when Moses was writing down not
&gt;  only what is the Ten Commandments, but
&gt;  Deuteronomy, which is almost the Second Law.
&gt;
&gt;  "Here is what he said to the children of
&gt;  Israel about this whole matter:
&gt;
&gt;  "'If there is found among you, within any
&gt;  of your gates which the Lord your God gives
&gt;  you, a man or a woman who has been wicked in
&gt;  the sight of the Lord your God, in
&gt;  transgressing His covenant, who has gone
&gt;  and served other gods and worshipped them,
&gt;  either the sun or moon or any of the hosts
&gt;  of heaven which I have not commanded you,
&gt;  and you hear of it, then you shall inquire
&gt;  diligently. And if it is indeed true and
&gt;  certain that such an abomination has been
&gt;  committed in Israel, then you shall bring
&gt;  out to your gates that man or woman who has
&gt;  committed that wicked thing, and stone to
&gt;  death that man or woman with stones.'"
&gt;  (Deuteronomy 17:2-5, NKJV)
&gt;
&gt;  "Now, that's what Moses said to the
&gt;  children of Israel about those who worship
&gt;  the sun and the moon and the hosts of
&gt;  heaven, because these things, at best, are
&gt;  lifeless nothings, or, if they are
&gt;  intelligent, they're demonic. And, yes,
&gt;  there is a host of heaven. There are angels
&gt;  and there are fallen angels. There is no
&gt;  question about it."
&gt;
&gt;  "Can a demon appear as a slanty-eyed,
&gt;  funny-looking creature? Of course he can,
&gt;  or it can. Of course they can deceive
&gt;  people. And if they can lead somebody away
&gt;  from the true God, or away from Jesus
&gt;  Christ, anyway it happens, it doesn't
&gt;  matter, you will lose your salvation. It
&gt;  doesn't matter how they get you. The
&gt;  question is, did they get you, and under
&gt;  what guise?
&gt;
&gt;  "This is man in rebellion against God, who
&gt;  refuses to take God's Law. And God says,
&gt;  'My covenant says you won't do this. And if
&gt;  I find anybody in Israel,'-- "which is his
&gt;  pure nation" -- 'If I find anybody in
&gt;  Israel that's doing this sort of thing,
&gt;  then I want you to take him out and dispose
&gt;  of him."
&gt;
&gt;  "It's a clear violation of God's word."
&gt;
&gt;  Skipp Porteous, Freedom Writer publisher,
&gt;  commented: "As the founder and chairman of
&gt;  the Christian Coalition -- a group
&gt;  dedicated to becoming the most powerful
&gt;  political force in America -- Robertson's
&gt;  extreme ideas need to be taken seriously,
&gt;  for they not only negate pluralism, but
&gt;  condemn to death those who dare to believe
&gt;  differently."
