Oct 13-14 IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC)

The International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) is the first
annual conference on computers that are worn as clothing.  The
conference is peer reviewed and sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society.  The purpose of ISWC is to bring together researchers,
product vendors, research sponsors, and other interested persons to
share information and advances in wearable computers and augmented
reality.  The conference will include paper presentations,
exhibitions, and poster sessions.

	Registration is now open at

<A  HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/wearcon/">http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/wearcon/</A>

	Reserve your space before SEPTEMBER 1ST for the best hotel rates.

	A list of topics from the CFP and the advance program is below.

	Please forward!
