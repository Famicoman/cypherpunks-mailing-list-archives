Andy Dustman &lt;andy@CCMSD.chem.uga.edu&gt;
&gt; &gt; Wasn't there an email forgery web page around for a while.  The idea
&gt; &gt; was that you filled in the details of who you wanted to send to, what
&gt; &gt; address you wanted it to appear you had sent it from, and paste your
&gt; &gt; message in this form box.  It did some kind of crude sendmail forgery
&gt; &gt; for you.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm. Someone has recently been forging mail to appear to be from cracker
&gt; through something like this (very bad forgery, headers are all wrong).

I said "wasn't there", as in past tense.  It got nuked years ago now
(literally) because of complaints.  When I looked at the page it still
had the text but a note that it was disabled, and why.

Just wandering if anyone knew if anyone else had set up something more
recently that still worked.

&gt; &gt; You'd not want to use the same public access account regularly.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not thinking of an account so much as maybe a PC in a university
&gt; computer cluster. Pick one and go. At a big university there should be
&gt; several clusters around campus.

You might get away with that for a pretty long time, I guess.

&gt; &gt; I think the connecting to the web based interface of one of those free
&gt; &gt; web gateways via www.anonymizer.com web based interface has potential.
&gt; 
&gt; It does, but I know The Anonymizer blocks some sites, at their request.

Right.  So there is one anonymizer, and if we make a big game of using
this method, Lance will get threats, and at best be asked to block
them.  We need something more distributed.

That network of anonymizers isn't here yet.

&gt; &gt; How much trouble can you get in with ISPs for forging email?  Do they
&gt; &gt; care?
&gt; 
&gt; Mindspring cares. My ISP was absorbed by them about two weeks after I
&gt; signed up. They say in their terms of service that impersonating someone
&gt; else is forbidden, but they specifically allow the use of anonymous
&gt; remailers and nicknames. I assume this means forging is frowned upon,
&gt; unless you are impersonating someone who doesn't exist, I guess.

Well I was thinking along the lines of:

	bubba@dev.null

type addresses yes.  You ain't imitating anyone there.  I wonder if
they frown on generating non-replyable email addresses though.
Non-existant domains.  I speculated in the previous post that perhaps
the habit of using: 

	gizmo@netcom.com.NOSPAM

might make ISPs accustomed to having people use non-replyable email
address all the time.
