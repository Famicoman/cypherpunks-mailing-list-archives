I used to think things like this would be quickly declared
unconstitutional, but not any longer. The New Order is making things like
this all too predictable. I just hope Adam Shostack does not get in even
more trouble for speaking out.

&gt;
&gt;From the New Yerk Tomes cybertimes:
&gt;
&gt;Proposed U.S. Rules Would Place Prior Restraint on Publishers
&gt;
&gt;By PETER MAYNOR
&gt;
&gt;Under a proposed set of rules being circulated by the Commerce
&gt;Department, the Clinton Administration is considering regulating
&gt;Web servers that allow publishing of political tracts and other forms
&gt;of information. Among the sites that would be affected are those now
&gt;operated by organizations like Planned Parenthood, the National Rifle
&gt;Association, and Citizens for the Destruction of Washington, all of
&gt;which distribute publications over the Web. Under the proposed rules,
&gt;access to such sites would be more tightly controlled or could disappear
&gt;altogether in the future.
&gt;
&gt;The requirement for Federal approval of a Web server, however, is
&gt;buried inside the densely written, virtually impenetrable document,
&gt;and the change is not even noted in the executive summary at the
&gt;beginning. The new regulation would require that anyone setting up
&gt;a Web server offering published materials seek an "advisory opinion"
&gt;from the Bureau of Thoughtcrime Affairs.
&gt;
&gt;The opinions carry no weight in court and only serve as an indication
&gt;of the agency's view on the matter at a given moment. A company
&gt;could later be prosecuted for publishing materials despite receiving
&gt;permission in an advisory opinion, although the existence of the
&gt;opinion should offer some emotional support with the court. Failure to
&gt;seek &gt;permission will likely be interpreted by courts as evidence of
&gt;criminal tendencies.
&gt;
&gt;The purpose of the rule is to force the Web server to take all prudent steps
&gt;to ensure that publications do not violate the laws of the United States.
&gt;
&gt;The proposed regulations do not set out any hard and fast guidelines
&gt;for an organization to meet.  The new regulations hwould effectively force
&gt;&gt;organzations to shut down their Web servers until the Ministry of Truth
&gt;could rule on the material -- a process that can take several months.
&gt;
&gt;Brewart Staker, a former general counsel for the Ministry of Truth who now
&gt;&gt;practices at the Washington law firm Goldsgtein, Blair &amp; Orwell, said
&gt;that the &gt;difficulty the regulators face is that the regulations must
&gt;adapt to a quickly &gt;changing Internet environment.
&gt;
&gt;"They're saying 'Here's the basic standard. Show us what you're trying to
&gt;do. If you're doing what we feel is a good faith effort, then we'll
&gt;approve it,'" &gt;Staker said. "They don't quite say that, but I suspect
&gt;that's what's going on."
&gt;
&gt;To draw an analogy, he compared the action to a hand check in basketball, a
&gt;move by which a defensive player warns someone with a ball that they're
&gt;there by touching them. "Think of this as just as a friendly &gt;warning from
&gt;Big &gt;Brother, telling you he loves you and is looking out for your best
&gt;interests."
&gt;
&gt;Adam Shostack, a Boston-based Cypherpunk facing imprisonment for
&gt;belonging to a subversive organization,  said that the current rules were
&gt;already making it difficult for his clients to publish their ideas. The
&gt;new &gt;regulations, Shostack predicted, will just make matters worse.
&gt;
&gt;"We've never needed the permission of the government to publish
&gt;anything in this country," Shostack said. "I don't see where their
&gt;legal authority comes from."
