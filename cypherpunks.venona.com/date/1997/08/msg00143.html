&gt; &gt; Tim, you're in my killfile now too so I'm not going to respond directly to
&gt; &gt; your comments.
&gt; 
&gt;   Me neither. I'm going to use email.

OK. I was trying to not-so-elegantly back out of the big hole I dug for
myself.
To be completely honest, I am fascinated (I don't know if this is the right
word
here...) by this discussion and if we were f-t-f I would probably still be
engaged
but I find Tim's arguments too deep to write off, but I find myself without
enough
time right now to engage with my full attention...and if I don't give this my
full
attention, I'm sure I'll lose... so, I gave up... for now. I'll formulate my
thoughts
and next time, I'll think before I write. Maybe I'll wait for a chance to take
a
stab at Tim later on.

&gt; &gt; Any journalist in Europe or in the U.S. would be seen as having
irreparably
&gt; &gt; compromised his journalistic objectivity by serving on such a panel! And
&gt; &gt; properly so, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; As long as they were representing their personal opinions and not acting as
&gt; a journalist (ie being paid by a 3rd party) and they disclose the action
&gt; there would be compromise on objectivity.

Jim, I hope you meant to say "wound not be compromising" in the above
statement.
This may sound like an afterthought, but one of the reasons that I did
such a stupid thing as post my association with a police study group 
here was as a part of being very open about what I was doing and
trying to ask for advice on that basis. Also, FYI, I am not being paid
by the government or any 3rd party. I am not a "consultant" to the
government. I am an "outside expert". I am not representing the police
to the people of Japan, I am trying represent the peoples' interest to
the government... but I'll stop now before I get bashed again.

- Joi
