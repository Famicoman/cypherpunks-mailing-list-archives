&gt;Encryption's In The Federal Spotlight
&gt;(08/05/97; 9:00 a.m. EDT)
&gt;By Darryl K. Taft, Computer Reseller News
&gt;
&gt;WASHINGTON -- President Clinton is determined to push electronic
&gt;commerce forward, but when it comes to encryption, some safeguards need
&gt;to remain in place because of law enforcement and national security
&gt;concerns, said William Reinsch, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
&gt;undersecretary for export administration.
&gt;
&gt;Speaking at the National Computer Security Association's (NCSA)
&gt;Electronic Commerce Security conference here, Reinsch reiterated that
&gt;the
&gt;president and U.S. policy favors an electronic marketplace that is not
&gt;regulated by the government.
&gt;
&gt;"It's obvious our policies about encryption is a piece of the large
&gt;puzzle that
&gt;doesn't quite fit our definition of a free market," said Reinsch,
&gt;adding, "The
&gt;increased use of encryption carries with it serious risks for public
&gt;safety and
&gt;our national security. Any policy on encryption must address these risks
&gt;as
&gt;well if it is to be in the national interest. Our policy provides that
&gt;balance by
&gt;working in close consultation with the private sector and by working
&gt;with the
&gt;market, not against it."
&gt;
&gt;William Murray, an executive consultant with Deloitte &amp; Touche,
&gt;disagreed.
&gt;Murray said the present government policy favors security and ease of
&gt;investigation over crime prevention and "the lawless over the law
&gt;abiding. I
&gt;know of no criminals who are worried about the administration's
&gt;policies, but
&gt;my law-abiding clients are."
&gt;
&gt;Murray, who also spoke at the NCSA conference, said he believed the
&gt;government's policy is "sowing so much fear, uncertainty and doubt that
&gt;it is
&gt;the single most incapacitating thing we have to deal with."
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, Reinsch outlined several areas where he said he felt the
&gt;administration's policies regarding export control and key management
&gt;are
&gt;making a difference. Reinsch said new regulations creating a license
&gt;exemption that allows recoverable encryption products of any strength
&gt;and
&gt;key length to be exported freely after a single review by the Department
&gt;of
&gt;Commerce, the Department of Justice and the Defense Departments.
&gt;
&gt;To encourage the development of recoverable encryption products, the
&gt;government created a special two-year liberalization period during which
&gt;companies may export 56-bit DES or equivalent products, provided they
&gt;show that they are working to develop the key management infrastructure
&gt;envisioned by the administration, Reinsch said.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps the best gauge of industry response to the administration
&gt;policies has
&gt;been the flow of applications for exports, Reinsch said. In the seven
&gt;months
&gt;since the policy went into effect, the Commerce department received more
&gt;than 100 license applications for exports, valued at more than $500
&gt;million.
&gt;In addition, Reinsch said 33 companies have submitted plans on how they
&gt;will build key recovery products, and the Commerce department approved
&gt;29 of them with more to come. "None have been rejected," Reinsch said,
&gt;noting that he could only name the companies that have already announced
&gt;their applications, such as Netscape Communications, IBM, Trusted
&gt;Information Systems and Digital Equipment.
&gt;
&gt;Reinsch said the market continues to be confusing because "companies
&gt;might
&gt;say one thing in private with the government and then take a totally
&gt;different
&gt;position publicly." Murray said, "The government does the same thing."
&gt;
&gt;Moreover, Reinsch said industry concerns that foreign availability of
&gt;encryption products appear to be exaggerated. "We do not yet see
&gt;widespread foreign use of encryption," he said. "We've discovered that
&gt;every
&gt;country is going through the same issues we are." 
&gt;
