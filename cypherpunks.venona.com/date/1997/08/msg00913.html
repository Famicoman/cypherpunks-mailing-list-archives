&gt;Microsoft - The Next Generation...
&gt;
&gt;"Star Trek Lost Episodes" transcript.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts at finding
&gt;a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have you been able to access their
&gt;command pathways?"
&gt;
&gt;Geordi "Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching through
&gt;our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology."
&gt;
&gt;Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.
&gt;
&gt;Riker looks puzzled. "What the hell is `Microsoft'?"
&gt;
&gt;Data turns to answer. "Allow me to explain. We will send this program, for
&gt;some reason called `Windows', through the Borg command pathways. Once inside
&gt;their root command unit, it will begin consuming system resources at an
&gt;unstoppable rate."
&gt;
&gt;Picard "But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter their
&gt;processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"
&gt;
&gt;Data "Yes, Captain. But when `Windows' detects this, it creates a new version
&gt;of itself known as an `upgrade'. The use of resources increases exponentially
&gt;with each iteration. The Borg will not be able to adapt quickly enough.
&gt;Eventually all of their processing ability will be taken over and none will
&gt;be available for their normal operational functions."
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Excellent work. This is even better than that `unsolvable geometric
&gt;shape' idea."
&gt;
&gt;. . . 15 Minutes Later . . .
&gt;
&gt;Data "Captain, we have successfully installed the `Windows' in the Borg's
&gt;command unit. As expected, it immediately consumed 85% of all available
&gt;resources. However, we have not received any confirmation of the expected
&gt;`upgrade'."
&gt;
&gt;Geordi "Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and CPU
&gt;capacity, but we still have no indication of an `upgrade' to compensate
&gt;for their increase."
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Data, scan the history banks again and determine if there is
&gt;something we have missed."
&gt;
&gt;Data "Sir, I believe there is a reason for the failure in the `upgrade'.
&gt;Appearently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan by not sending
&gt;in their registration cards."
&gt;
&gt;Riker "Captain, we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin emergency
&gt;escape sequence 3F ...."
&gt;
&gt;Geordi, excited "Wait, Captain! Their CPU capacity has suddenly dropped
&gt;to 0% !"
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Data, what do your scanners show?"
&gt;
&gt;Data, studying displays "Appearently the Borg have found the internal
&gt;`Windows' module named `Solitaire', and it has used up all available CPU
&gt;capacity."
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Let's wait and see how long this `Solitaire' can reduce their
&gt;functionality."
&gt;
&gt;. . . Two Hours Pass . . .
&gt;
&gt;Riker "Geordi, what is the status of the Borg?"
&gt;
&gt;Geordi "As expected, the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to compensate
&gt;for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they successfully
&gt;increase resources I have setup our closest deep space monitor beacon to
&gt;transmit more `Windows' modules from something called the `Microsoft
Fun-pack'.
&gt;
&gt;Picard "How much time will that buy us?"
&gt;
&gt;Data "Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest time
&gt;span of 6 more hours."
&gt;
&gt;Geordi "Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Identify."
&gt;
&gt;Data "It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft' logo..."
&gt;
&gt;Over the speakers "THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE MICROSOFT FLAGSHIP
&gt;MONOPOLY. WE HAVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE IN THIS
&gt;SECTOR. SURRENDER ALL ASSETS AND WE CAN AVOID ANY TROUBLE.  YOU HAVE 10
&gt;SECONDS TO COMPLY."
&gt;
&gt;Data "The alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and released
&gt;thousands of humanoid-shaped objects."
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft!"
&gt;
&gt;Riker "My God, captain! Those are human beings floating straight toward
&gt;the Borg ship - with no life support suits! How can they survive the tortures
&gt;of deep space?!"
&gt;
&gt;Data "I don't believe that those are humans, sir. If you will look closer
&gt;I believe you will see that they are carrying something recognized by
&gt;twenty-first century man as doeskin leather briefcases, and wearing Armani
&gt;suits."
&gt;
&gt;Riker and Picard, together - horrified "Lawyers!!"
&gt;
&gt;Geordi "It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up and sent hurtling into
&gt;the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."
&gt;
&gt;Data "True, but appearently some must have survived."
&gt;
&gt;Riker "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with all types
&gt;of papers."
&gt;
&gt;Data "I believe that is known in ancient venacular as `red tape'. It often
&gt;proves fatal."
&gt;
&gt;Riker "They're tearing the Borg to pieces!"
&gt;
&gt;Picard "Turn the monitors off, Data, I can't bear to watch. Even the Borg
&gt;don't deserve such a gruesome death!"
