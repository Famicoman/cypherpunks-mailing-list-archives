&gt; You know, you are just about the biggest idiot I have ever had the
&gt; displeasure of reading. For one, the largest religion in the US right
&gt; now *is* in fact judeo-christian. The largest is Roman Catholic with
&gt; Pentacostal Protestant following right behind. 

judeo-christian isn't a religion.  Christian is.

&gt; Next, this country was
&gt; founded on christian beliefs, or have you failed to read the words of
&gt; the constitution of the US. Considering the apparent ignorance you have
&gt; displayed thus far about the makeup of the US, I would venture to say
&gt; that you probably have not read it.

I have read the Constitution and the history behind it.  The US was
founded by people trying to escape religious persecution and/or trying
to get rich.  In case you can't figure it out, forcing your views down
my throat IS religious persecution -- exactly the same sort that sent
the Pilgrims off on the Mayflower.

&gt; Next, you attack christians for
&gt; trying to control the content made available on the internet. At least
&gt; the site ratings plan is better than alot of other plans I have seen.
&gt; Besides, Oh Godlike TruthMonger, where is *your* surefire plan to halt
&gt; the spread of trash that *most* humans would want out of of the reach of
&gt; their children? I have not seen you *once* offer a straightforward clear
&gt; cut plan to efficiently handle *any* issue placed for discussion on this
&gt; listserv. I have seen you do nothing but slam, belittle, and degrade
&gt; others and their beliefs and ideas. 

That statement is somewhat similar to saying that if you don't like your
chains you are free to suggest the stocks or perhaps rope.

&gt; You do this under the unimpressive
&gt; tag of "TruthMonger". If anything, you are anything but a TruthMonger.
&gt; When you can come up with a plan that even *remotely* seems like a
&gt; logically thought out, planned, and intelligent proposal on how to
&gt; handle the issues presented everyday on the internet that affect the
&gt; computing industry balanced with a concern for the children, then I will
&gt; listen. 

As long as the scum that gravitates toward LEAs and the Government
continue to do so it is relatively stupid to express (or defend) views
outside the accepted norm in an open fashion.  (I guess that makes me
sorta stupid, huh?)

&gt; (And yes, I do agree that the parents of the children have an
&gt; obligation to monitor the content they are exposed to. It's called
&gt; responsible parenting which unfortunately is not a well practiced
&gt; ideology. And to take the wind out of your sales, I have 2 children and
&gt; as a parent I limit them to what is appropriate to their ages.)

I have two of my own and I don't see how "protecting" them in the ways
that you seem to like would do anything other than warp their worldview
to such a level that they will be esay prey for whatever scum they run
into in the meatworld.  

&gt; Until
&gt; such time as you can fulfill the obligations to us, the adult computing
&gt; population, and our offspring, the children (just in case your fuddled
&gt; mind does not know what they are), I suggest you rest those busy little
&gt; fingers of yours and listen to the underlying theme of the issues before
&gt; us. 

I don't know about TruthMonger but I did listen to the underlying theme
of the issues before us and I found that it was actually scum-suckers
and other bottom feeders trying their damnedest to steal my freedom. 
That's why I'm typing here and now.

&gt; Until then, HateMonger, I have one suggestion for you..... Shut Up!

The hatemonger that I see in this interchange is not TruthMonger and
it's not me -- Let's see, I guess that leaves . . .

Not the TruthMonger,

Paul H. Merrill
