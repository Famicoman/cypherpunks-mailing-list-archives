&gt;"They started screaming, 'Put your hands where we can see them.' They

&gt;masks and carried machine guns. They kept her handcuffed for two hours.

Nazi Fascism at work.  Legalized thugs, the NEW brownshirts.

&gt;The target of the raid? A 6,500-acre bow-and-arrow hunting ranch, the last
&gt;bastion of private property on the island. The raid resulted in three
&gt;arrests -- volunteer Rick Berg, 35, and caretakers Dave Mills, 34, and
&gt;Brian Krantz, 33 -- on suspicion of robbing Chumash Indian graves and
&gt;taking human remains and artifacts, charges they denied.

All that shit to arrest some guys who may or may not have taken things from graves???  Someone explain to me how we need to have people with Automatic Weapons arrest some guys for a trivial crime?  Nazi Fascism at work.

&gt;The agency responsible for all this was not the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
&gt;and Firearms, nor the FBI, nor any other agency typically associated with
&gt;such "dynamic entries." This raid was the work of the National Park
&gt;Service.

You've gotta be shitting me.  Forest Rangers with Automatic Weapons????? I'd hate to see what they'd do to a guy lighting a match in a forest camping ground.

&gt;Surprised? So were local residents. Though no lives were lost, the raid
&gt;inspired a firestorm of protest. "It saddens me that the Park Service has
&gt;resorted to Ruby Ridge tactics," said Marla Daily, president of the Santa
&gt;Cruz Island Foundation, referring to the September 1992 standoff between
&gt;the FBI and Randy Weaver that resulted in the death of Weaver's wife. "This
&gt;incident clearly crosses the line," Daily said.

This incident demands armed rebellion and government overthrow.  It demands people going to parks to carry automatic or semi-automatic rifles.

&gt;If the use of the Park Service in commando-style operations seems strange,
&gt;it shouldn't. At a time when elected legislative bodies from city councils
&gt;to Congress -- have been passing laws that restrict the rights of
&gt;law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms, federal agencies within the
&gt;executive branch have been quietly authorizing dramatically increased
&gt;numbers of armed personnel -- often heavily armed with military-style
&gt;assault weapons.

If this isn't pure evidence of preparing a takeover of fascist forces, then i don't know what its.

&gt;Today, there are nearly 60,000 federal agents trained and authorized to
&gt;enforce the over 3,000 criminal laws Congress has passed over the years,
&gt;plus the hundreds of thousands of regulations which now carry criminal
&gt;penalties.

This is another big leap past what our Founders intended.

&gt;"Good grief, that's a standing army," said Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of
&gt;America. "It's outrageous."

Then it's time for all citizens of this country who love freedom to form a militia, controlled by citizens.  Arm yourselves.

&gt;According to a recent report from the General Accounting Office, as of last
&gt;September, the number of law enforcement personnel stood at just under
&gt;50,000 -- distributed through 45 agencies -- an increase of about 12,000
&gt;agents in 10 years with 2,436 added in 1996 alone. These are full-time
&gt;agents, authorized to execute searches, make arrests, and/or carry firearms
&gt;"if necessary."

If necessary is another double-talk bullshit term meaning carry weapons dangerous to freedom-loving citizens everywhere.

&gt;But that number is not complete. When some 7,145 Customs inspectors and 317
&gt;Customs Department pilots are added -- all of whom have the above listed
&gt;law enforcement powers -- the total is pushing 60,000. Why doesn't the GAO
&gt;count them? Not because they aren't armed and dangerous, but because they
&gt;have different retirement benefits.

And some beaureacratic bullshit along with Fascism.

&gt;Also, a GAO staff consultant explained that the report doesn't include
&gt;contract personnel or personnel from agencies with less than 25 officials
&gt;in law enforcement -- which is why some agencies, the Federal Emergency
&gt;Management Agency, for example, aren't on the list.
&gt;
&gt;The recent GAO report is the third and final in a series requested by Rep.
&gt;Bill McCollum, R-Florida, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime, to
&gt;gather information on agencies charged with investigating violations of
&gt;federal law.

Someone PLEASE bump off Bill McHitler.

He's the same jackass that was proposing the "Dangerous Predators" bill jailing kids with adults.

&gt;An earlier report, released last year and presenting figures through Sept.
&gt;30, 1995, dealt with the 13 biggest agencies -- those with 700 or more
&gt;investigative personnel. Not surprisingly, the FBI topped the list with
&gt;over 10,000 agents, followed by the INS, Drug Enforcement Administration,
&gt;and the U.S. Marshalls Service -- all in the Department of Justice.
&gt;Treasury agencies follow -- the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Secret
&gt;Service, Customs, BATF and the Postal Inspection Service. Then the National
&gt;Park Service, U.S. Capitol Police, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service
&gt;and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security in the State Department.

Why not go ahead and just for ministries of Peace, Truth, Plenty?

&gt;The final report deals with the 32 agencies that employ about 9 percent of
&gt;the law enforcement personnel. It's among these 32 that you'll find the
&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife, EPA's Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics and
&gt;Training, the Bureau of Land Management's Law Enforcement division and
&gt;other law enforcement bodies not usually traditionally with guns.
&gt;
&gt;Yet, the proliferation of firearms is even greater in these agencies: from
&gt;a total of 2,471 law enforcement employees in 1987 to 4,204 as of Sept. 30
&gt;last year, a 70 percent increase.

It's time we the people started doing the same.

&gt;But beyond the flat figures loom questions of how agencies are using, or
&gt;abusing, the powers they have in everyday law enforcement. Sting operations
&gt;and other entrapment tactics, hidden-camera surveillance, phone tapping --

Don't forget interrogation beatings, and illegal search and seizures.

&gt;these have become commonplace practices in the name of investigation. So,
&gt;too, has the use of dynamic entry teams -- the kind witnessed at Waco and
&gt;Ruby Ridge.

And they wonder why the Davidians were armed to the teeth.

&gt;David Kopel, director of the free-market Independence Institute in Golden,
&gt;Colorado, is an outspoken critic of the usurpation of local and state
&gt;police authority by the federal government and the growing use of violence
&gt;in law enforcement. According to Kopel, the FBI has 56 SWAT teams that
&gt;"specialize in confrontation rather than investigation, even though
&gt;investigation is, after all, the very purpose of the bureau."

Also purposes include fighting strong crypto among citizens, and threatening makers of crypto.

&gt;"Whereas (J. Edgar) Hoover's agents wore suits and typically had a
&gt;background in law or accounting, SWAT teams wear camouflage or black ninja
&gt;clothing and come from a military background," he said. "They are trained
&gt;killers, not trained investigators."

That's why we need to have MORE citizen militias then EVER.

&gt;Even worse, other agencies are trying to match "FBI swashbucklers." BATF,
&gt;DEA, U.S. Marshalls Service, even the National Park Service and Department
&gt;of Health and Human Services -- all have their own SWAT teams.

If I start seeing postal agencies with swat teams I'm joining a militia.

&gt;Contacted by telephone, Kopel said he was "not shocked " at the growing
&gt;size of the community of federal law enforcement personnel as reported by
&gt;the GAO, "in light of the trends over the past 20 years." "Of course," he
&gt;added, "it would have astonished and frightened the authors of our
&gt;Constitution."

As I said, Nazi Fascism, and usurping of freedom.

&gt;"There's a continuing imperative (for an agency) to get power, and they'll
&gt;come back again and again until they get it," says Eric Sterling, president
&gt;of the Washington-based Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and a counsel
&gt;for the House Judiciary Committee in the 1980s. Sterling, who describes
&gt;himself as a liberal, is particularly alarmed by the arming of agencies
&gt;with military weapons, such as machine-guns.

I'm increasingly astonished at the rate we citizens lose military weapons.

&gt;"The machine-gun is an indiscriminate weapon, and is singularly
&gt;inappropriate for the FBI and other agencies," he said. "Its use by a
&gt;government agency is a horrifying prospect."

Yes, horrifying that soon it will lead to Dictatorship.

&gt;In full agreement is Greg Lojein, legislative counsel for the American
&gt;Civil Liberties Union. He deplores not only the expansion of the federal
&gt;law enforcement, but the lack of constraining mechanisms.

There is a constraining mechanism, bombs and military rifles in the hands of citizens.

&gt;"Local police are subjected to review (by civilian boards), but not federal
&gt;agents," he noted. "When the Department of Justice investigates (an agency
&gt;incident), the results are not nearly as trustworthy as when an independent
&gt;entity investigates. Just ask Richard Jewell about this."

Well, the Feds are above the law anyway.

&gt;Lojein called attention not only to the procurement of military weapons
&gt;themselves, but to the acquisition of heavy equipment such as military
&gt;helicopters and tanks as well -- "heavy equipment," he said, "more
&gt;characteristic of war than of law enforcement."

War against citizens.

&gt;"The last thing people want to see is a tank on a city street," he said.
&gt;"That's what you expect to see in Bosnia, but not in Boston."

Time to see more bomb-throwing freedom fighters here in America.

&gt;Kopel sees the federalization of law enforcement and the growth of the FBI
&gt;as parts of a larger effort to establish a national police force. He cites
&gt;in particular the involvement of the FBI in local law enforcement. "Besides
&gt;traffic tickets, there aren't many crimes where the FBI isn't involved in
&gt;the prosecution," he said.

Nazi Fascism at work.

&gt;Eventually, he predicts, federal law enforcement agencies will be merged
&gt;--beginning by moving the Treasury agencies under the control of the
&gt;Justice Department, as Al Gore has recommended. "But a separation of powers
&gt;is at least a small check on the movement towards total police power
&gt;consolidation and keeps them from going completely overboard," said Kopel.

It's time to rebel.

&gt;Others are concerned that the militarization of the federal government has
&gt;already gone too far -- that once-benign agencies have been given
&gt;incentives to become armed and dangerous.

Many citizens have been given the incentive to make themselves armed and VERY dangerous to fascism loving nazis like Clinton and Freeh.

&gt;The raid at Santa Cruz, for instance, wasn't the first for the Park
&gt;Service. It wasn't even the most horrific in terms of outcome. Just one
&gt;month after the Weaver debacle at Ruby Ridge, Malibu millionaire Donald
&gt;Scott was gunned down in his home in a mid-morning assault involving 14
&gt;agencies, including NASA, Immigration and Naturalization Services and the
&gt;L.A. County Sheriff's Department. The alleged reason for the attack was
&gt;that Scott was suspected of growing marijuana.

&lt;sarcasm&gt;Obviously, a dangerous crime to society.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

&gt;None was found. There, as at
&gt;Santa Cruz Island, the lead agency was the NPS; and there, too, the real
&gt;reason was to acquire Scott's estate for the Park Service.

Stealing land from citizens for use by the rulers.  I'm telling ya, it's FASCISM.

&gt;At Santa Cruz, the National Park Service had been trying to obtain the
&gt;6,500-acre ranch -- which covers 10 percent of the island. The Nature
&gt;Conservancy owns the other 90 percent. The three arrests occurred as the
&gt;National Park Service had obtained orders from Congress to seize the ranch.

Seize it for what?

The time has come for all people to revolt with weapons; bombs, guns, knives, and anything that can kill Fascist Nazis and their supporters.  Aquire weapons, form militias, retake the country.  It's time to reinstate Democracy.

If this continues, we're going to see more Oklahoma Cities.

Arm yourselves, arm your neighbors, arm freedom lovers.  Fight Fascism.  That is the ONLY answer.

And they still wonder why McVeigh said "Enough!!!"

FreedomMonger
"There's something wrong when Ranger Rick gets and automatic weapon, and Federal agencies become blurred with the Military."
