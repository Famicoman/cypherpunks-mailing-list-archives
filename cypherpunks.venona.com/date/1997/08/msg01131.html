&gt; Subject: Re: Reproductive Rights and State Benefits (fwd)

&gt; &gt;Would you be so kind as to explain exactly what the 14th brings to the
&gt; &gt;table that was not already covered in the original document? We didn't
&gt; &gt;need the 14th and still don't. It was, and still is, a political ploy to
&gt; &gt;get people to willingly (through ignorance) comply with a bunch of
&gt; &gt;schills.
&gt; 
&gt; Nice try but it was you who brought up the 14th in your original reply to
&gt; my message. An intresting debating technique present and argument then
&gt; blame your opponent for brining up that argument.

You're the one trying a straw-man, I was simply asking a question based upon
several comments you have made both in this exchange and in others as well.
It had nothing to do with your original question but rather an attempt on my
part to expand the discussion to include the 14th which it must to be whole.

Or is your view that you are the only party who may bring other issues into
this discussion? Because, my personal opinion is that I don't need your
permission to include other issues in the argument as long as I feel they
are relevant and can justify them.

&gt; Clause 2:  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which
&gt; shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall
&gt; be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
&gt; Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any
&gt; Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
&gt; notwithstanding. 

&gt; This trumps any argument you have made on this issue so far.

Not really as it clearly states in the first clauses where that authority
comes from and the 10th clearly puts limits on what expansions the courts
and legislature can do with the Constitution. The last clause also clearly
states that the constitutions and laws of any state are not superior (but
does not deny equality as granted in the 10th) to the laws and treaties of
the federal government. The last clause also provides even less reason for
the 14th.

Face it bud, you ain't got a foot to stand on.
