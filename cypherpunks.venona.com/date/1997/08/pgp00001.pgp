I agree that spam presents interesting issues if addressed as a denial
of service attack.  However, a few nits to pick:

* I don't think having a central authority issuing "spam-free certificates" to 
everyone who wants one is a deterrent to spammers.  People spam once, get
another spam-free certificate, spam again, etc.  It doesn't matter that they
get revoked each time.  Spammers switch email addresses/domain names
frequently enough nowdays

* Any solution which requires host administrators to filter user actions will
fail because it is so trivial to run one's own system connected by ppp/slip/
some other ip protocol.  It's not hosts which cause problems, it's people.

* At one extreme, I might choose only to read email pgp-signed by people
I already enjoy speaking with.  New mail would just get dropped on the floor
(I already do this with my pager-email gateway, only pgp signed mail from
people I really want to talk to gets forwarded, the other stuff waits for
me to log in).  At another, I would read everything anyone posts with
equal lack of prejudice.  Somewhere in the middle, there might be "certifying
agencies" which try to verify that their users won't spam -- users pay some
small administrative fee, perhaps, and as a result get accreditation, which
would be revoked if they were spammers.  As well, the prestige of the rating
agency would go down if it had to revoke too many certificates.  Users would
then choose which user-filtering agencies they trusted to filter users, and
only read mail which came with those signatures.  This kind of loses unless
you can guarantee a spammer will never subvert a user's account, be willing
to sign up as a member of a service, get through its screening measures
(which would varying according to the level of verification they wanted to
have, ranging from just signing up to paying money to leaving a large deposit
check to having had a reputaton established prior to this which could be
verified).  In general, the approach seems doubtful to work on a network-wide
scale, at least to me.

* I'm extremely wary of any system which allows a "they" to control the
posting rights of a user by sheer volume.  What reason is there to think 
the CoS couldn't get a bunch of its disciples to claim someone is spamming
for expressing an anti-CoS sentiment somewhere?  Etc.  Something which has
an organization with which a user freely associates and chooses to follow
certain rules and then enforces those rules itself would be much saner.  
Particularly if there are a multiplicity of such services providing different
kinds of service.


An approach which I think might work well would be if users formed 
self-regulating communities which exchanged communications freely among
themselves and had access to the outside negotiated through shared keys/etc.
Then users would be free to treat mail from inside the group, where everyone
adhered to certain standards or was punted, and where user authentication
was strong enough to prevent a spammer from stealing someone's account, as
worthwhile correspondence, and treat all of the other material as unfiltered,
potentially trash.  There could be different levels of trust for different
groups, etc.  You could encourage your friends to sign up with agencies you
used or trusted, or just use traditional user-to-user authentication to
recognize their mail.  Forums could come up with lists of commonly accepted
providers to ease discourse -- perhaps these providers would help subsidize
these forums in some way.  There isn't as much of a need to authenticate
users who are in continual contact already, but rather to filter messages
from people one hasn't yet met.

Sounds disturbingly like a feature which should find its way into pgp 6.0.
eeek.
