EAT THE FOODS YOU LOVE
NO WILL POWER REQUIRED
**************************************
Anyone who has struggled to lose weight, like I did, 
can tell you DIETS ALONE DON'T WORK !  
That's because the difference between thin and overweight 
individuals has more to do with metabolic rate than what 
they eat.  It's believed most lean individuals have a
metabolism designed to BURN FAT !

We have designed a product that works
several ways to help you achieve maximum
results from your weight-loss program. This
unique blend of herbs, botanicals and Chromium
Picolinate, improves your metabolism so
your body relies more on stored fat and 
less on stored proteins.
"LOSE THE FAT....
       NOT THE MUSCLE"

Typically, up to 30% of lost weight is
muscle.  This lowers your metabolic rate and
slows calorie-burning.  This lowered metabolic
rate makes it hard to keep lost pounds from
creeping back.  Result: the "Yo-Yo" syndrome
in which weight is repeatedly lost and then 
regained.  After each lose-gain cycle the 
portion of fat increases.

To break this vicious cycle, it is important
to lose only fat while maintaining, or even 
increasing muscle.  Studies show that optimal
chromium nutrition is an effective part of long-term
fat-loss programs.  Our unique formula of 
specialized herbs and botanicals is coupled 
with the best source of chromium available,
patented Chromium Picolinate.

HERE'S EVIDENCE !

Several double-blind crossover studies
conducted along with clinical and laboratory
tests at a leading university and hospital have 
proven that the ingredients in this product are 
effective.

Without changing dietary or exercise
habits, over a six-week period, subjects in 
separate studies lost an average of 23% body fat or
approximately 4.4 lbs. of fat, and increased lean 
body mass by 1.5 lbs.

People over the age of 46 did even better,
and women seemed to do the best.  People
with elevated cholesterol levels averaged a 10%
drop in LDL cholesterol.

          WHAT EXACTLY IS 
      CHROMIUM PICOLINATE?

It's a bioactive chromium with clinically
proven benefits.  Chromium is vital to
good health and is essential for the efficient
functioning of insulin.  Poor responsiveness to 
insulin is common and is linked with increased
risk of being overweight, heart disease, elevated
blood fat, high blood presure and diabetes.

Over 90% of American diets provide much
less than the minimal amount of chromium
recommended by The National Academy
of Science.  Most forms of chromium are not
easily absorbed by the body, but chromium
picolinate, being bioactive, is easily absorbed.
In fact, it has been shown to reduce body fat,
lower cholesterol and even reduce elevated
block-sugar in diabetics.

THE DIET BREAKTHRU OF THE CENTURY !!

"Over the last 10 years, I have tried a variety of 
weight loss methods, spent thousands of dollars 
and failed at all of them.  By December 1995, I
was the heaviest I had ever weighed-235 lbs.
I had no energy.  My self-esteem had hit rock
bottom... I was introduced to Thermo Lift and 
have never looked back! My energy level has
boosted and my weight loss increased... In total
I have lost 70 lbs. and went from a size 22 to a
size 12.  The most amazing part - It's So Easy!"
Becky

"I began using Thermo-Lift the seventh week of 
gymnastics training to achieve a specific result: a
washboard stomach.  By the end of the eighth week
all I could see were solid stomach muscles!  I
recommend Thermo-Lift to all my muscle therapy
clientele for its superior fat burnng and muscle toning
abilities."   Chris

"I had tried everything to lose weight but nothing worked.
With Thermo-Lift I was amazed at how quickly I lost
weight - 4 pounds in 4 days! My energy level has 
sky rocketed and it's helped me curb my chocolate  
binges.  Thanks!!"       Gloria
