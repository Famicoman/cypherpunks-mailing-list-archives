&gt;&gt; Meethinks (not speaking for Tim) that years under a fascist natzi-like
&gt;&gt; regime bent on ripping out all out freedoms one by one and confiscating
&gt;&gt; all things threatening to it would cause any awake person to lose any
&gt;&gt; compassion for the scum that run our Freeh country.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;BULL SHIT.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is a cop-out, used by emotionally stunted men to excuse
&gt;themselves from their solemn responsibility to ethically
&gt;justify their own actions and to deal fairly with their fellow
&gt;humans.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By reciting mantras to one another emphasizing their sense of
&gt;having been mistreated and their sense of having
&gt;_unquestionable_ moral superiority, people in this situation
&gt;persuade each other to become more and more fanatical in their
&gt;attitudes, less and less in touch with reality, and less and
&gt;less compassionate towards the "others" who have been demonized
&gt;in the process.

I have written truly large numbers of posts explicating my philosophy. You
may not agree with my point of view, but characterizing me--as I assume you
were in your response to this thread about "Tim's heart"--as merely
reciting mantras to others is false.

It is you, B., who have generally been inactive on the list for quite some
time, only occasionally dropping in to snipe. Referring to us as
"emotionally stunted men",,,now there's a solid argument for whatever it is
your position is.


&gt;Note that this process _always_ includes a group of other
&gt;humans which are demonized in order to serve as a scapegoat and
&gt;as a concrete focus for the participant's negative emotions.

You mean like "emotionally stunted men"?

Or do you mean like the characterization of list members as "socio-economic
cult" members?

&gt;But I will _never_ take one of these actions while intoxicated
&gt;by a cloud of hatred and self-righteousness.  I will _never_
&gt;tell myself that I am part of a sacred jihad which absolves me
&gt;of all guilt, and I will _never_ re-classify my enemies as
&gt;sub-human in order to justify my treatment of them.
&gt;
&gt;So take a fucking BREAK man.  Just get up from the computer and
&gt;go for a fucking walk in the mountains and think about your
&gt;fucking family and loved ones.

You sound like you're ranting to me. Lecturing others on their anger while
writing "take a fucking BREAK man" and foaming about sacred jihads and
emotionally stunted men....

Physician, heal thyself.
