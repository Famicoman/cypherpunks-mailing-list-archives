&gt; &gt; I can't fuly agree. In Europe, both communism and fascism started from the

&gt; The fascists called themselves Socialists for the same reson that the
&gt; main pro logging group calls themselfs _The Forest Protection Socity_ as a
&gt; returorical techneek to sucker peaple.

Socialism tends to lead to a fascist society.

&gt; &gt; and both accept the "... idea of a political party which embraces all 
&gt; &gt; activities of the individual from the cradle to the grave, which claims
&gt; &gt; to guide his views on everything, and which delights in making all
&gt; &gt; problems questions of party...," F.A. Hayek, The Road to Surfdom.

That's a reasonable expose' of the similarities.

&gt; Replace political party with free market and you get the econmic
&gt; reationalisum/thatureisum that has chocked socity.  The freandly
&gt; socilisum that both the GNU mannifesto and most of the net works on
&gt; has no such totalitarian tendencies.

The free market is much closer to the freedom of the net than you
might imagine.

eg. Socialism says that the state will steal from by force (guns,
imprisonment, etc follow quickly if you resist the theft) to give to
others who `need'.  Needs are unbounded.  How do you measure `need'?
By who has the most expensive lobyists, who can afford to pay the
highest bribes to politicians?  By who is the laziest and has allowed
their personal affairs to slip into the most disgraceful state.

In a free market economy such `needs' are met by charity.  People give
of their own free will, and give to charitable organisations that they
view as the most efficient at handling the causes they individually
think worthy.

If people don't want to give to this charitable cause, well then it
isn't worth supporting, to them.  If you have to take their charity
and gun point, it isn't charity, it's theft.

Socialism is based on theft.  So is Fascism.  It's forced labour, or
at least forced theft of assetts.

`Social contract' foo.  What social contract did I sign with the
crooks milking the political system?
