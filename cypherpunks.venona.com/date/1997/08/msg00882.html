&gt;Personally, when I email politicians and the like, I usually use
&gt;anonymous remailers, including the Georgia Cracker, so that I don't
&gt;have to worry about being discriminated against and/or investigated
&gt;and/or imprisoned for being afflicted with a physical and mental
&gt;condition which causes me great discomfort when I am forced to tell
&gt;polite lies under the guise of free speech.

Remailers are here to help the weak against the powerful.

I use em 10 times a day.

&gt;  In short, a ratfucker is a ratfucker is a ratfucker, and if anyone
&gt;objects to being called one, then they should make an effort not to
&gt;be one, rather than calling for my head on a platter because I call
&gt;a spade a spade (or a "fucking shovel").

Damned right.

&gt;  Two nights ago I began to teach my niece and her high-school girl
&gt;friend how to use remailers for anonymity to communicate with others
&gt;in a manner that will not leave them vulnerable to tracking/stalking
&gt;by strangers.

Good Ideas...  How about publishing how to use remailers and post it to a
high school Bulletin Board?

&gt;  If someone wants to spam me, or threaten me, or whatever, through
&gt;the use of anonymous remailers, fine--I have a delete key and I have
&gt;mail filters.

A many a Christian bunghole forgets that instead of forcing their god down
people's throats, (Tyranny of the MINORITY) they should make an effort to
realize there's such a thing as the real world, were god doesn't matter to
some people.

&gt;  Every time some Nazi piece of shit announces his or her intention
&gt;to "protect" somebody, my freedom, privacy and human rights seem to
&gt;get thrown in the trash. 

Yeah, "We gotta protect the children from the pedophiles and cypherpunks!"
I've heard shit like that often from politicians.

&gt;  I'm growing tired of those who want to lock all of the doors on
&gt;the InterNet and control the keys so that the citizens will be
&gt;imprisoned behind an ElectroMagnetic Curtain where they are only
&gt;allowed to travel at the discretion of a higher authority.

Damn right again.

&gt;  My advice to well-meaning fascist censors is to stay the fuck out
&gt;of the InterNet regulation business, because there are too many 
&gt;people on the InterNet who have experienced its freedom and who will
&gt;no go easily into the dark night.

Damn right for the third time.

&gt;  I was in Poland shortly after the fall of The Wall, and was talking
&gt;to a lady who was describing how hard life had become in the resulting
&gt;"chaos of the new." I asked her if she thought that the citizens would
&gt;return to the former political system if conditions got bad enough.
&gt;  She said, "Over my dead body."

Which describes my similar views of the growing socialism in America.

&gt;  Someone wants to shut down your remailer? Fine. I'll start one up.
&gt;They want to shut down my remailer? Fine, but what about the Eternity
&gt;Servers?
&gt;  Don't know about the Eternity Servers? They are waiting to route
&gt;around the damage caused by shutting down remailers, and there is
&gt;another technology waiting to replace the Eternity Servers if they
&gt;get shut down.

If they knock em out, another one just takes over and fills in.  Kinda like
Dynamic Routing.

&gt;  I, for one, am not going to stand by listlessly while fascists
&gt;attempt to build an ElectroMagnetic Curtain around me.
&gt;  I have a byte, and I'm not afraid to use it.

Heheh, "Take a byte out of Net.fascists"
