&gt;  FREEDOM WRITER PRESS RELEASE
&gt;
&gt;  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 28, 1997
&gt;  CONTACT: Skipp Porteous (413) 528-3800
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Robertson advocates stoning for UFO
&gt;  enthusiasts
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Great Barrington, MA -- In a recent
&gt;  pronouncement, television evangelist and
&gt;  head of the Christian Coalition, Pat
&gt;  Robertson, advocated death by stoning for
&gt;  crypto enthusiasts.
&gt;
&gt;  Freedom Writer magazine, in its July/August
&gt;  issue, mailed today, disclosed Robertson's
&gt;  statement. Freedom Writer is published by
&gt;  the Institute for First Amendment Studies,
&gt;  a group that monitors the right.
&gt;
&gt;  Robertson used the news of the July 25th
&gt;  Senate Commerce Committee hearing to promote
&gt;  his extreme beliefs. A segment on the July 27,
&gt;  1997 broadcast of The 700 Club featured news
&gt;  of the Senate hearing. Employing the
&gt;  historical event as a starting point, the
&gt;  program delved into the possibility of the
&gt;  existence of anonymous free speech on the
&gt;  Internet.
&gt;
&gt;  While Robertson viewed the Internet with
&gt;  suspicion, on a more serious note, he
&gt;  launched into a diatribe against those who
&gt;  entertain the existence of uninhibited free
&gt;  speech on the Internet. He said, in a
&gt;  rambling discourse, that if such a thing
&gt;  existed, it would simply create demons that
&gt;  would lead people away from Christ.
&gt;  According to Robertson, the threat is so
&gt;  serious that people who believe in free
&gt;  speech should be put to death by stoning --
&gt;  according to "God's word."
&gt;
&gt;  "The Bible says the Earth belongs to man,
&gt;  but the Word belongs to the Lord,"
&gt;  Robertson said.
&gt;
&gt;  "He has given us the Earth. He also warned 
&gt;  us in the book of Matthew of the dangers of
&gt;  corrupting forces such as the Internet which
&gt;  can be used for evildoers:
&gt;
&gt;  "'A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can
&gt;  a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that
&gt;  does not bear good fruit is cut down and 
&gt;  thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their
&gt;  fruits you will know them. (Matthew 7:17-20)'
&gt;
&gt;  "And you see, there is only one Word, and
&gt;  that is the Word of God:
&gt;
&gt;  "'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
&gt;  was with God, and the Word was God. (John 1:1)'"
&gt;  'For the Word of the Lord is right; and all his
&gt;  works are done with faithfulness. He loveth
&gt;  mercy and judgment: the earth is full of the
&gt;  mercy of the Lord. (Psalm 32:4-5)'
&gt;
&gt;  So there is no question about it."
&gt;
&gt;  "Can a demon appear as a slanty-eyed,
&gt;  funny-looking computer hacker? Of course
&gt;  he can, or it can. Of course they can deceive
&gt;  people. And if they can lead somebody away
&gt;  from the true God, or away from Jesus
&gt;  Christ, anyway it happens, it doesn't
&gt;  matter, you will lose your salvation. It
&gt;  doesn't matter how they get you. The
&gt;  question is, did they get you, and under
&gt;  what guise?
&gt;
&gt;  "This is man in rebellion against God, who
&gt;  refuses to take God's Law. And God says,
&gt;  'My covenant says you won't do this. And if
&gt;  I find anybody in Israel,'-- "which is his
&gt;  pure nation" -- 'If I find anybody in
&gt;  Israel that's doing this sort of thing,
&gt;  then I want you to take him out and dispose
&gt;  of him."
&gt;
&gt;  "It's a clear violation of God's word.
&gt;  Stone them."
&gt;
&gt;  Skipp Porteous, Freedom Writer publisher,
&gt;  commented: "As the founder and chairman of
&gt;  the Christian Coalition -- a group
&gt;  dedicated to becoming the most powerful
&gt;  political force in America -- Robertson's
&gt;  extreme ideas need to be taken seriously,
&gt;  for they not only negate pluralism, but
&gt;  condemn to death those who dare to believe
&gt;  differently."
