&gt;A European parliament study evaluating `Feasibility of censoring and
&gt;jamming pronography and racism in informatics':
...

&gt;7.1.2 It is concluded that available technology does no and is
&gt;      not likely to provide any satisfactory means for
&gt;      automatically classifying such material. Such judgements
&gt;      will therefore have to be made by humans.

The perfect kind? (One wonders what sort of humans would be drawn
to such a job, and which humans will choose or be forced to pay
them?)

...
&gt;      - it can not be absolutely guaranteed that Internet
&gt;        anonymity services can not be used to frustrate
&gt;	detection of offenders in certain circumstances.

Ahh, the double-negatives of understatement.

...
&gt;7.2.9 It is concluded that only implementation of the most
&gt;      intrusive surveillance technology could be exspected to
&gt;      impact heavily upon abuse of the Internet on committed
&gt;      offenders (because of their ready access to strong
&gt;      encryption and covert communication technologies). To
&gt;      enable this policy scenario, it would be necessary for
&gt;      access providers to constrain the equipment used by
&gt;      subscribers to access the Internet to be such that:
&gt;
&gt;      - no content could be removed;
&gt;
&gt;      - all content and processing could be subject to
&gt;        automatic and manual surveillance.

Achtung, information-Juden!

&gt;7.2.10 The technical and economic feasibility of the necessary
&gt;      technology is evidenced by the emergence, with purely
&gt;      commercial motivations, of technical systems which privde
&gt;      the basic facilities required to implement the necessary
&gt;      measures. It is notes that this coincidental emergence of
&gt;      such systems may raise siginificant privacy issues
&gt;      outside of the scope of this study. The economics of
&gt;      manual surveillance, however, can not be assessed.

How 'bout "tax-and-spend"? That's an assessment.

...
&gt;      Detecting offenders
&gt;      
&gt;7.2.13 If access providers and service providers maintain
&gt;      proper subscriber authentication systems and system
&gt;      management environments, offending actions at the site to
&gt;      which the subscriber authenticates can be traced to the
&gt;      offender. Detection of offenders committing offences 'at
&gt;      a distance' (ie a subscriber in a country committing an
&gt;      offence in another), however, would require:
&gt;
&gt;      - access and service providers to take steps to ensure
&gt;        subscriber identity information is carried in their
&gt;	transmissions;
&gt;
&gt;      - monitoring of services provided on the Internet to
&gt;        prevent subscribers misusing anonymity services to
&gt;	remove such information.

This kind of monitoring, were it actually possible to implement,
would mean the effective end of anonymity services. Thankfully,
it is presently merely a statist pipe dream.

&gt;7.2.14 Whilst a variety of means exist to attach identity
&gt;      information, detection of anonymity services is not
&gt;      straightforward. However, monitoring such services would
&gt;      be exspected to limit the number available for overt, eg
&gt;      to transmit offensive material to innocent parties,
&gt;      offensive use.

Translation: "Shut as many of 'em down as possible."

&gt;7.2.15 Legally, handling offences detected through voluntary
&gt;      authentication would be relatively straightforward as the
&gt;      offending subscriber would be resident in the country
&gt;      where the offence was committed. However, offences can
&gt;      only be detected through forced identification, ie those
&gt;      committed 'at a distance', would currently be subject to
&gt;      extradition arrangements and it is not clear that new
&gt;      opportunities for prosecution would arise in practice.

Oh boy - "opportunities for prosecution," WHEEE!

&gt;      Meanwhile, it may be that the social implications of
&gt;      forced and general identification of Internet subscribers
&gt;      would leave subscribers open to a variety of forms of
&gt;      intrusion on privacy and discrimination.

Oh, but "we" can trust Craig Livingstone, Louis Freeh, Aldrich
Ames, and the rest of the spies, can't "we."

Why am I feeling so worried these days, anyway?
