&gt; Subject: Re: Reproductive Rights and State Benefits (fwd)

&gt; Well you are complicating the issue by assuming that we are in two
&gt; different states.

No, I am making no such assumption the Constitution however does. Quite
clearly I might add.

&gt; If you and I are citizens of the same State you do not
&gt; have the right to deny me my rights protected under the Constitution of
&gt; the United States of America regardless wether you are in the majority
&gt; view or not.

Which is completely irrelevant since the federal government has no authority
over intra-state disagreements that do not involve some resource that lies
outside the state of residence of the parties involved...

I quote from the Constitution again...&lt;sigh, doesn't anyone actualy read the
whole damn thing?&gt;

Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, 
arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties 
made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; -- to all Cases affecting 
Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; -- to all Cases of admiralty 
and maritime Jurisdiction; -- to Controversies between two or more States; -- 
between a State and Citizens of another State; -- between Citizens of 
different States; -- between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under 
Grants of different States; -- and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, 
and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. 

Section 1.  Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the 
public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And 
the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, 
Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. 
 
Section 2.  The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges 
and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. 


				ARTICLE X. 
 
	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, 
or to the people. 

 
			       ARTICLE XIV. 
 
Section 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and 
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States 
and of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce 
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens 
of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, 
liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person 
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 

Section 2 through 5 deleted &lt;again&gt;. 


Would you be so kind as to explain exactly what the 14th brings to the table
that was not already covered in the original document? We didn't need the
14th and still don't. It was, and still is, a political ploy to get people
to willingly (through ignorance) comply with a bunch of schills.
