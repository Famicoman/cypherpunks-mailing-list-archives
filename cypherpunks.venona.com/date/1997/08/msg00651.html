Or, if our government actually got smart, they could offer a bounty on the
Mexican drug lords.  There are a lot more poor people in mexico.  A
Mequilladora (spelling?) to export drug policy?  I think if they offered
to make Tijuiana a protectorate and infuse a billion or two in cash after
the last drug lord was eliminated the border problems would cease.

If you wanted to use individual bounties, the problem is proving that you
were the one who killed the target.  Snipers usually can't wait around to
collect the scalp (Encrypted VCR through the viewfinder maybe?).

I think that Harry Browne suggested this more economic approach to
terrorists in his book and campaign last year.

But the US doesn't consider this "fair".  They would rather send our
military in as they did in Haiti and Panama, have lots of people on both
sides killed, and bring them back for a show trial, or battle to a
stalemate like with Iraq and Somalia.

But instead, they are going to raid the homes of more people who install
central air conditioning so their electric bills go up, which is reported
to the police who cannot concieve of anything except a basement full of
grow-lites over marijuana plants as using any electricity.

10 years from now they will still probably be paying informants in person
with $20 bills with consecutive serial numbers, but only if they insist on
not getting a check or direct deposit :).  Where is BCCI when you need it.
