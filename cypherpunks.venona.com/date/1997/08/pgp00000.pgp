I've been looking at the current eternity server, and it's a nice thing, but
I'm kind of convinced no system like this which does not allow for electronic
payments for those taking the risks will be successful.  Perhaps I'm wrong,
but I don't think so.  It takes money to run a secure data store.  (my 
current project depends upon secure distribued available data storage,
so I've been looking into this for a while)

Would anyone else be interested in working on a real reliable distributed
data store, more like what Anderson described than the current Eternity
server?  Specifically, something with payment systems built in, a multiplicity
of ways to pass messages from server to server, and a multi-level design in
which a maximum amount of anonymity is preserved?

I'm not saying I don't like the current eternity server, just that I'd like
to work on one with payment systems built in, and more closely following 
the original idea for an eternity server (which I thought was a great one).
