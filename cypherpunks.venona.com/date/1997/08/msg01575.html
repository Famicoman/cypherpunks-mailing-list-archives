To be removed from our email list, send a blank email to 
      remmee@answerme.com
We will also send you the URLs of two sites where you can go to have your 
name removed from hundreds of mailing lists!             
======================================================================

       The BEST Deal On Email Addresses Is Right Here!

You can find email lists all over the place. If you buy from the wrong
source, you will end up paying too much and recieving all flames and no
orders.
                      Not if you buy your list here!

Our email lists are compiled from a number of different sources. Each list
we sell is checked against our extensive remove list to reduce the number
of flames you recieve. In addition, we make our lists available at very
reasonable prices.

Just look at what our competition is charging for their lists:

                        10,000               $50.00
                         20,000              $100.00
                         30,000              $150.00
                         40,000              $200.00
                         50,000              $250.00
                         60,000              $300.00
                         70,000              $350.00
                         80,000              $400.00
                         90,000              $450.00
                        100,000              $500.00

                        These prices are OUTRAGEOUS!

Because we believe that everyone should have access to email lists, we are
offering our lists for the low, low price of $99 per million!
That's right! Only $99 gets you a list of 1,000,000 prospects to email your
ad to! 
                 UPDATE******************************UPDATE
As of Monday, July 14 we will be offering our complete email list for sale.
The list consists of 40 million email addresses gleaned from a variety of 
domains. By purchasing the entire list, you can save BIG! The addresses will 
be shipped on CD ROM in plain text files. 

NO UNZIPPING!!
Because the files are on CD-ROM, they do not have to be zipped in order
save space. 

NO PASSWORDS!!
Why should you waste your time looking up codes to unzip your address files
when you could be making money?
   --You Shouldn't!
That is why our CD will contain no password protection or zipped files. They
are truly ready to be mailed.

This list of 40 million prospects can be yours for the amazingly low price
of only $349.95.  

These addresses will be checked against our extensive remove
list to reduce the chance of you being flamed. Of course, there is no sure
fire guarantee against flames, but this will definitely help.

**No one can flame you if they don't know your email address. Only give
your email address to your customers. Not only does this reduce flames, it
also protects your internet account from termination.

                     How do I protect my email address?
1st of all, send your email with the Stealth Mass Mailer. This program will
protect your email address while sending your mail at speeds of up to
250,000 messages per hour (28.8 connection).
2nd, collect your inquiries and remove requests via AutoResponders . Using
AutoResponders, you don't even have to read the flames. Just move them to
your remove list and forget about them!
