I was having dinner with Don Haines, a friend of mine who's a legislative
counsel with the national ACLU, when the McVeigh verdict came down.

A Canadian prosecutor who was having dinner with us said: "So McVeigh did
it after all."

Don replied: "No. He was found guilty of the crime."

There is a difference.

&gt; 
&gt; Okay folks...what the hell is wrong with you? First off, this whole McVeigh 
&gt; Crap is a bit off topic..but we all know this. The amazing thing about the 
&gt; string of posts has been that people have forgotten that He has been found 
&gt; guilty of murdering quite a few people. Guilty,  Guilty,  Guilty. Jury of 
&gt; his peers, dare I say, people like us all. Randomly selected. This is how 
&gt; our system works.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes there are flaws in the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes the US govt. has it's problems in the past, present and future.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes people have died because schnooks in DC have had thier heads up thier 
&gt; ass. Or not.
&gt; 
&gt; So whether or not you belive he did it.....how can anyone be _for_ what 
&gt; _happened_. People died senselessly, I can't believe that anyone (in this 
&gt; case Duncan Frissell frissell@panix.com, lets give credit where it is due) 
&gt; can be so callous and , frankly, sick , to say :
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&gt;
&gt; As to the Children of OKC, people who turn the care of their children over 
&gt; to
&gt; government employees or contractors do not place too high a value on those
&gt; children.
&gt; &lt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Are you serious? You should be ashamed that you think this way. Do you 
&gt; really
&gt; think those children who died weren't cared for? You are a sick person who
&gt; should seriously consider therapy. Anyone who read this and said "Yeah!" 
&gt;  is
&gt; on the same plane.
&gt; 
&gt; To all the people who defend blowing shit and people up to get thier point 
&gt; across....
&gt; 
&gt; Okay..so the IRA does it, and HAMMAS does it, and the CIA does it. So does 
&gt; the
&gt; PLFP the FARC and a zillion other terrorist groups. And it appears McVeigh 
&gt; did it.
&gt; But that doesn't make blowing up children in freakin' day care all right. 
&gt; Do you
&gt; understand this? There is no reason to blow up kids. It's wrong. For any 
&gt; reason.
&gt; Bad. Duncan...looking over your past posts.. .I've got to wonder if you 
&gt; were on acid
&gt; when you wrote this, many of your posts were fairly cozigent. But this? Do 
&gt; you have
&gt; children? Any  cousins who are children? A nephew or neice? Do these 
&gt; children
&gt; who may be important to you have parents who "care" about them enough to
&gt; scour the planet to find a good,safe day care that isn't withing the blast 
&gt; radius or
&gt; shooting range of :
&gt; 
&gt; A government office.
&gt; A large corporations headquarters.
&gt; A law firm.
&gt; A post office.
&gt; A town square.
&gt; A restaurant.
&gt; A bank.
&gt; Anywhere some asshole might have a gun and go loopy.
&gt; Anywhere some asshole might have a car be drunk and go loopy.
&gt; Anywhere some asshole might have a gun and a car and be drunk and go loopy. 
&gt; 
&gt; If they even could, I'm someone somewhere will find a way to fuck up that 
&gt; safe place.
&gt; 
&gt; You get the point, I could go on....but I won't.  Perhaps you should think 
&gt; and read
&gt; over your posts before you post again. The only good thing (and I mean 
&gt; ONLY) to
&gt; come out of the whole Mcveigh thing being discussed here on cypherpunks, is
&gt; that it has allowed me to add to my killfiles people who have for some 
&gt; reason,
&gt; had a prefrontal.
&gt; 
&gt; To all the dipshits who could possibly think otherwise. I should also 
&gt; mention it
&gt; is an EQUALLY fucked up thing to blow up adults.
&gt; 
&gt; Like my fellow Santa Clara County Resident Bill Frantz said :
&gt; 
&gt; For cypherpunks this comes down to: Make code, not bombs.
