Actually the profile doesn't look too evil.
One wonders who's pushing him on this, since he
doesn't come across asa crypto expert ;)


Below is from the Project Vote Smart pages...

Senator J. Robert 'Bob' Kerrey

                            Performance Evaluations by Special Interest
Groups



                                               How to Interpret These
Evaluations

These evaluations are in percentage form. They represent the percentage
of 
time that the incumbent voted with that organization's preferred
positions on a number of
votes that they identified as key in their issue area. Remember, by
definition, these r
atings by special interest groups are biased. They do not represent a
non-partisan stance. In addition, some groups select votes that tend to
favor members 
of one political party over another, rather than selecting votes based
solely on
issue concerns. However, they can be invaluable in showing where an
incumbent has 
stood on a series of votes over a year's time, especially when ratings
by groups
on all sides of an issue are compared. Descriptions of the organizations
offering p
erformance evaluations are available. 

Project Vote Smart collects performance evaluations from ALL special
interest groups 
who provide them. If there is a group you that feel is missing from our
database, either they do not compile performance evaluations, they would
not allow 
Project Vote Smart to distribute them, or we are unaware of the fact
that the
group does ratings. Please let us know if you think we are missing a
group's 
ratings and we will contact the group immediately. 

A final note: The clearest way to read these percentages is, "In [year],
the X
YZ organization gave Senator/Representative X an 80% rating. That means
that on
votes they identified as key in their issue area during that time
period, he/she 
voted with the group's preferred position 80% of the time." The
exception to this is the
evaluation done by the National Taxpayers Union, which represents how
often a 
representative or senator voted to decrease, or not increase, spending.
