&gt; June 21, 1942, Fort Stevens at the mouth of the Columbia in Oregon is fired 
&gt; upon by the deck gun of a Japanese submarine. The first continental costal 
&gt; battery to be attacked by a foreign enemy (not counting those Southerners) 
&gt; since the War of 1812.  The Japs fire 17 shells. No apparent damage.  Fort 
&gt; Stevens is unable to depress its guns sufficiently to hit the submarine.  A 
&gt; draw.

Two Jap subs were sunk in San Francisco harbor. Unfortunately I can't find
the dates, will keep looking.

&gt; Oregon also suffered the U.S. Mainland's only domestic casualties due to 
&gt; enemy action when a teacher and members of her family on a hike in southern 
&gt; Oregon were killed by a Japanese balloon bomb.  (These bombs were attached to 

Actualy it was a man, his wife, and two children. The two kids were playing
with it when it went off. My memory tells me that the women and two kids
were killed. Don't remember if she was a teacher or not. There was an
interesting video recreation on TDC last month on this incident on a special
on the Japanese balloon bombs.

&gt; balloons released from Japanese submarines off the coast.)

Actualy most of them were released from the Japanese mainland at specific
points. If you do further research on this you will learn how they used the
ballast sand in the balloons (mechanicly complicated) to track their source.
All the sites were bombed and the baloons ceased.
