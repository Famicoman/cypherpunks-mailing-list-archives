      Cypherpunks June 97 Physical Meeting Announcement
      (SF Bay Area, Northern California chapter)

           Date: 14 June 1997 (second Saturday as usual) 
           Time: 12pm - 4pm 
           Host: Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. 
           Contact: Dave Del Torto - 415.596.1781 voice 

Agenda for 14 June 97 (subject to slight variations):

1.Angelos Keromytis &amp; Hugh Daniel on their Linux IPSEC work: 
	Hot news from the recent IPSEC interoperability bake-off in Michigan

2.PGP 5.0 Source Code Release &amp; Public Review: The first release of *all* 
	final PGP 5.0 source code to the People! PGP engineers will be
	present to discuss technical details and answer specific questions. 
	A number of copies will be available (free) to attendees who wish 
	to review the cryptography code (note: we recommend that you
      bring a box or bag, as it's 14 volumes and nearly 7,000 pages). 

3.HIP97 Trip Planning Committee: A group from California is planning on
	attending the 
	     Hacking in Progress '97 
	event sponsored by XS4ALL in the Netherlands (8/9/10 Aug). 
	This event is followed by the IETF meeting in Munich, and some will 
	continue on. We'll discuss our cooperative travel plans. 
	Cf. N.B.: Contact ASAP for flight info as flights are being booked 
	up rapidly (high tourist season). 
		[Editors Note:  _High_ tourists in Amsterdam??]

4. Ian Goldberg's Cool Canadian Crypto Software for Pilot Organizers
	If somebody from Berkeley can give Ian a ride,
	he'll demo the crypto libraries and applications he wrote
	while out of the US.

PGP Building Access:

This is an Open Meeting on US Soil and it is free for anyone to attend. 

      There is a minor building security formality due to the facilities
	being in a bank building:  anytime after 12 noon, approach the 
	Bayview Building's Information window (in the plaza, see below for
	directions), and ask the Guard on Duty to let you up to the 
	2nd Floor for the Cypherpunks meeting (use the passphrase 
	"cypherpunks release code"). If you have any difficulty 
	(eg. if the guard is on a break), simply call me at 415.730.3583 
	and I'll let you in. 

      You can arrive at any time during the scheduled meeting hours, 
	though earlier is better if you want to hear the interesting stuff. 


Directions to PGP:

      Pretty Good Privacy's HQ is located at: 

      2121 South El Camino Real 
      9th Floor - (the meeting is on the 2nd Floor) 
      San Mateo CA 94403, USA 

                         Directions available here 
			<A  HREF="http://www.pgp.com/pgpcorp/contactpgp.cgi#head">http://www.pgp.com/pgpcorp/contactpgp.cgi#head</A>
                                    or 
  follow DDT's Directions to PGP's HQ in San Mateo (fossil fuel version): 


                                    MACRO 

      From the North Bay: 

      Hwy 101 South (use right lanes after passing SFO) 
      EXIT Fwy 92 West (move to center lane immediately after ramp)... 
      or 280 South (take Hwy 92 East toward the Bay)... 

      From the South Bay: 

      101 North - EXIT Fwy 92 West (toward Half Moon Bay)... 
      280 North - EXIT Hwy 92 East (toward the Bay)... 

      From the East Bay: 

      San Mateo Bridge (Hwy 92 West) 
      GO past Hwy 101... 



                                     MICRO 

      Once you're on Hwy 92 (from either 280 or 101) 

      EXIT at SOUTH El Camino Real 
	(From 101 it's about a mile, and there are two El Camino exits!)
	(From 280 it's about 7 miles, after you've come down a steep grade,
	levelled out and passed under an overpass) 
      Curve around and down under freeway: you're now travelling south on
	El Camino Real. 
      Get in the LEFT lane *immediately*. (Directly in front of you, 
	you can see the Bayview Building a couple of blocks away: 
	it's the only highrise around.) 
      LEFT on 20th (The very first traffic light after exit ramp. 
	Taco Bell is on left). 
      RIGHT turn at next stop sign (residential street: Palm). 
      PROCEED 1.5 blocks. (Parking Garage entrance at rear of Bayview 
	building is on your right.) 
      PARK on the 2nd level. 

                                     NANO 

      Once you've parked your vehicle in the Garage (it's free): 
      STAIRS (or Elevator) to the main level, step out and... 
      WALK WEST across the courtyard to the main (tallest) building. 
      PASS through the doorway in the stand-alone exterior "glass wall" 
	and approach the "Information" window (also the Guard Station) 
	on the north side of the building. 
      GET the guard's attention (preferably *not* by waving a firearm).
	Use the passphrase and you'll be admitted.  If the guard's on a 
	break, call me at 415.730.3583. 
      ELEVATOR to 2nd Floor. (The meeting room is on left side, slightly
	down the hall) 

      Public Transit

      For CalTrain, get off at the San Mateo station near the Bay Meadows
	horse racing track and head for the tallest building around with
	the huge "Bayview" sign on top. It's a short walk or cab ride. 

      By bus, take any line running on El Camino Real to the intersection
	of 20th in San Mateo and dismount. Look up: you're there.
