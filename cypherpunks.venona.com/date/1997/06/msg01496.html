I thought I would pass this along.  Just downloaded it and am looking at
it.  Interesting application for Win 95/NT users.  The download page
starts at <A  HREF="http://www.luckman.com/anoncookie/anoncookie.html">http://www.luckman.com/anoncookie/anoncookie.html</A>

&gt;Freeware Helps Keep Your Cruising Confidential 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;by Brian McWilliams, PC World NewsRadio 
&gt;
&gt;June 24, 1997
&gt;Concerns about Internet privacy are running hot since the recent privacy
&gt;hearings sponsored by the Federal Trade Commission. New laws as well as
&gt;technology standards may soon come to the assistance of Net users. In the
&gt;meantime, a California company is releasing a freeware tool to help users
&gt;gain some control over their online privacy.
&gt;
&gt;Luckman Interactive today posted a utility for Windows 95 and NT called
&gt;Luckman's Anonymous Cookie for Internet Privacy.
&gt;
&gt;According to chief technology officer Marco Papa, the beta software works
&gt;with browsers from Microsoft and Netscape. It installs in your Win 95
&gt;system tray and enables you to switch in and out of "anonymizer mode,"
&gt;that is, controlling whether or not a Web site can write to and read your
&gt;browser's cookie file. This file is used by some sites to personalize
&gt;their content and in some cases to track your activities online.
&gt;
&gt;"We save all your cookie files and replace them with either an empty
&gt;folder or a file that can't be overwritten," explains Papa. "When you turn
&gt;cookies back on, you actually replace whatever may have changed with your
&gt;original cookie files."
&gt;
&gt;Luckman's Anonymous Cookie program is actually technology that was
&gt;developed for the company's WebSweep utility, which is scheduled for
&gt;commercial release later this summer. But Papa says the firm decided to
&gt;pull the cookie piece out now to give users some much-needed control over
&gt;online privacy.
&gt;
&gt;Dierdre Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology says cookie
&gt;files are at the heart of many privacy problems on the Net. Her group is
&gt;especially critical of companies like DoubleClick, which she says violates
&gt;the spirit of the cookie concept by passing user information on to third
&gt;parties. She welcomes tools like Luckman's, but she notes that add-ons
&gt;don't help protect the millions of less experienced Net users.
&gt;
&gt;"If you really want people to have an easy-to-use way to protect
&gt;information or to control what their kids are going to see on the Net,
&gt;build it into the browser. Everybody has one, and they don't have to go
&gt;buy an extra program or figure out how to install it," Mulligan said.
&gt;
&gt;Brent Luckman, chairman of Luckman Interactive, said that's a great idea,
&gt;but he doesn't see much impetus for browser makers to give up access to
&gt;valuable marketing information.
&gt;
&gt;If you're a privacy guerrilla, you can grab your free copy of the
&gt;Anonymous Cookie program from Luckman's Web site.
