Hi,

Forwarded message:

&gt; From: "Peter Trei" &lt;trei@process.com&gt;
&gt; Date: Wed, 4 Jun 1997 11:33:54 -6
&gt; Subject: Re: Webpage picketing (fwd)

&gt; [Jim wants to be able to 'cyber-picket' - force people to read his 
&gt;  opinions before they can browse sites he does not like. He is 
&gt;  attempting to claim that the net backbones corrospond to public
&gt;  spaces, where his local government permits him to picket.]

Quit taking the drugs they are affecting your attention span.
You should also quit trying to divine persons motivation, you are terrible
at it.

&gt; 'Publically funded network backbones'? Can you name one (in the US)? 

Actualy I have already named two.

&gt; None of which have the slightest relevance - Internet II is a 
&gt; proposed (and still vaporware) project for an academic-research-only
&gt; network

Actualy the Internet II documents that I have seen have specificaly
mentioned letting students at public schools use them as well as people
doing research both private and publicly funded. I understand that it should
start to take physical shape just after the turn of the century.

The High Speed Supercomputer network is also going to be available for use
within just a  couple years as well. 

 - it's future existence has no impact on those of us using
&gt; the private backbone system of today.

You have obviously missed the entire point, today is not the issue. It is
tomorrow that we should be looking at and the clear indications that Uncle
Sam puts out about funding/supporting future expansion. The federal
government can't afford to keep its fingers out of the pie.

&gt; Question: if you get the ability to put up your 'cyber-picket' frame,
&gt; how about cyber-counter-pickets? Cant the picketee put a page in 
&gt; front of yours? Who gets priority? Where does it stop? 

Yes. Yes. First come first served. When the funds run out.

&gt; Jim, your idea is roadkill on that horribly imprecise analogy, 
&gt; the 'information superhighway' (spit). It can't be resuscitated 
&gt; by asking for 'information super-sidewalks' or claiming the existance 
&gt; of 'information super-public-spaces'. The underlying metaphor is 
&gt; fatally flawed.

In your opinion, which so far has been nothing but inuendo, ad hominim
arguments, and pure opinion. How about some reasoning to go along with 
it?
