I sent this out last night, leaving the Cypherpunks distribution as
"cypherpunks@einstein.ssz.com." Alas, it does not seem to have propagated
to my site.

So here it is:


&gt;Date: Tue, 3 Jun 1997 19:09:30 -0700
&gt;To: Jim Choate &lt;ravage@einstein.ssz.com&gt;, cypherpunks@einstein.ssz.com
&gt;(Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer)
&gt;From: Tim May &lt;tcmay@got.net&gt;
&gt;Subject: Re: Hacker Links page (fwd)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;When I was on the Cyberial-l list, for lawyers and others interested in
&gt;cyberspace law issues, this issues of URLs being infringements came up a
&gt;couple of times.
&gt;
&gt;I think the answer is very clear: nobody needs permission of others to
&gt;print URLs.
&gt;
&gt;URLs are like footnotes. They are not actually links or tunnels of any
&gt;sort. They are just like "machine readable footnotes." If I refer a reader
&gt;to "Applied Cryptography," either by citing the book title and ISBN numer,
&gt;I do not need the permission of Bruce Schnier to cite this information. No
&gt;copyright law has ever been held to apply to the recitation of such cites.
&gt;
&gt;A URL is just an address, much like a ISBN number.
&gt;
&gt;In modern browsers, clicking on such a URL may be perceived as "taking you
&gt;there," and in some sense it does. But what the clicking really does is to
&gt;invoke the commands needed to send stuff to the address specified in a URL
&gt;and ask that site to send some stuff back.
&gt;
&gt;Jim and others know this, of course, so I am not lecturing them. Rather, I
&gt;am framing the debate in terms that copyright lawyers will surely
&gt;understand.
&gt;
&gt;Now, it may be true that Don Lancaster has decided, for example, that he
&gt;doesn't "like" the association of his URL with "hacker" topics. Too bad.
&gt;
&gt;It would be no different if Lancaster were to object to Timothy McVeigh
&gt;providing a reference or footnote to Lancaster's "The TTL Cookbook." Even
&gt;if McVeigh were to say he found the "TTL Cookbook" essential for building
&gt;bomb timers. (Not that far-fetched, actually.)
&gt;
&gt;"Fair use" extends to even including chunks of another's writing for
&gt;purposes of comment, critique, agreement, discussion, etc. It clearly then
&gt;applies to cites of the author's books.
&gt;
&gt;And more than just "fair use," citing the influence of others and saying
&gt;where more information can be found is the essence of free speech.
&gt;
&gt;(Which means I have the feeling Electronic Frontiers Georgia may be
&gt;entering the case on the side of Lancaster!)
&gt;
&gt;And Lancaster's choice to make his URL publically accessible means that
&gt;anyone can click on it. Open and shut.
&gt;

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
