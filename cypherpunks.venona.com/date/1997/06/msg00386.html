&gt;   God bless Timothy McVeigh for exposing the mindless hypocrisy of the
&gt; American people, as well as the _mindful_ hypocrisy of the Government
&gt; Rulers of Amerika.

Indeed, while McVeigh, or the guilty person if it was not McVeigh, can be 
categorised as evil, because of his acceptance of the death of a few 
innocents just to get at the guilty, his acts are certainly interesting 
in terms of the reactions they elicit from people and the level of 
reactionism they provoke, of course, it is virtually impossible to have a 
reasonable discussion with any of the sheeple about an issue like this, 
they get scared.

&gt;   Billy Graham, as the populist representative of Christianity, visits
&gt; the White House but we are little likely to see him visiting McVeigh
&gt; because some children's lives seem to be more precious than others, and
&gt; those who take them are subject to different moral judgments.

Of course, the consent of the majority of the people in your particular 
corner of the world puts you above the law. Some innocents are more 
innocent than others.

&gt;  Waco was nothing more than a "wake-up call" that many Americans slept
&gt; through. Timothy MvVeigh did not--he woke up and crowed loud enough for
&gt; all of us to hear. The American government, people and press, however,
&gt; want merely to shut him up and go back to sleep, pretending that there
&gt; still isn't enough light to see their own sins and rectify them.

Acts of terrorism always have the same response though, of course McVeigh 
has been painted by the media as public enemy number 1 in the new 
Amerika, a far right extremist, I`m quite suprised actually the 
government didn`t try to put a racist spin on the killings.

&gt;  Americans are now loudly calling for McVeigh to receive an electrical
&gt; message complaining about the high cost of the breakfast bill on the 
&gt; expense report he provided us.
&gt;  I wouldn't be surprised if his final words were, "Eggs is eggs."

Of course, if a government building in some middle-eastern "dictatorship 
of the week" country had been blown up with great loss of life, the 
american press and elected scum would have been falling over themselves 
rushing to congratulate the "heroic American soldier" who had carried out 
this "great act of liberation". By the way, did you know bootlace 
production is up 300% and tobacco rations are going up comrade?
