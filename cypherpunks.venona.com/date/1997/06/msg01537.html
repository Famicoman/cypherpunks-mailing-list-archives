&gt; &gt; Supervision, plain and simple. However, if you honestly believe your
&gt; &gt; children are going to be harmed in some lasting way by any images they
&gt; &gt; might find there is clearly something wrong with the way you have brought
&gt; &gt; them up
&gt; 
&gt;   Good, strong beatings will also help to deter them from doing
&gt; things that they find interesting or pleasurable. This will help
&gt; to reinforce the concept that things which feel good lead to
&gt; pain and punishment.

Indeed so: Lock and load!

&gt;   Pictures of people burning in hell can be put in prominent places
&gt; in the home, with constant verbal reminders that God will punish
&gt; bad people who have different values than you.

This is a common and well researched technique, which, along with self 
flagellation, can be very effective for moral purification.

&gt;   Impress upon your son that if he wants to have sex with 
&gt; teenage girls under the age of 18 he must move to a foreign 
&gt; country where he can receive millions of dollars in foreign
&gt; aide while he does so. 

I didn`t know the US age of consent was 18? Is this federal or state 
decided? It is 16 in the UK, not that any level is reasonable. 

&gt; Explain that if he has sex with his
&gt; teenage girlfriend in this country that he is an evil person
&gt; and will be convicted as a sex offender (which will delay
&gt; their wedding plans) and be marked for life as a child 
&gt; molester.

Indeed, prison violence by other prisoners against convicted sex 
offenders (ie. 18 year olds who have sex with their 15 year old 
girlfriend or just happen to accidentally pick up a 15 year old 
at a club, both henious crimes obviously) is very common in the UK.

&gt;   Most important of all, carefully explain to your children
&gt; that if their gaze ever happens to fall upon material which
&gt; you find unacceptable that they will end up being murdering,
&gt; drug-dealing pornographers because they are immoral dupes
&gt; with no character or self-will.

Yes, the very sight of a naked woman is enough to turn any 17 year old 
into a raving killer with no respect for human life, of course, the 
moment he turns 18 it is just socially looked down upon, but not 
criminal, this is obvious isn`t it? Shouldn`t there be a law!

&gt;   Use Paul and myself as examples of where libertarian thinking
&gt; leads, in the end. After all, he is writing from DEMON.co.uk and
&gt; I am writing from LUCIFER@dhp.com.

Yes, libertarian thinking is very pervasive. I used to be a minarchist, 
since thinking about the use of cryptography to preserve stable anarchies 
I have gravitated more and more towards an anarchist point of view with 
just a totally minimal NON-LAWMAKING state, ie. just a properly regulated 
police force, jail system, and the other associated bits and pieces, 
commercial methods, although they would be nice to totally purify 
anarchist doctrine &lt;-(for want of a better and less overloaded word), 
just do not seem to work for these services due to the necessity for 
impartiality, the market DOES NOT want impartial judicial systems...

It does not matter where you are located or who you associate with, or 
who you learn your life-view from, and how it develops. Proper 
logical libertarian thinking always leads to the same views, give or take 
the details. 

&gt;   If you are concerned about what your children may encounter
&gt; on the internet that will expose their lack of character and
&gt; morals, there is a program available that is even better than
&gt; Cybersitter. It was sent to the list by fuck@yourself.up a few
&gt; months ago.

I would recommend simply keeping all girls indoors in a cave until the 
age of 18, forcing them to wear a cast iron chastity belt, and arranged 
marriages.

Boys can safely be allowed to go out fucking who they like after they 
reach 16, and not a day before, but do not under any circumstances give 
them proper sex education so they do not get girls pregnant, they must 
face the consequences!
