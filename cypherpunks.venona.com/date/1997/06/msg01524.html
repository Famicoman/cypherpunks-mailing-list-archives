&gt; I'm curious as to why you feel the need to conceal your identity.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When it comes down to flag burning, It really bothers me that we allow our
&gt; &gt; symbol of freedom to be burned.  It's more than a flag and a right.  It's a
&gt; &gt; symbol of the freedom we have.  To allow someone to publicly burn a flag is
&gt; &gt; essentially displaying our freedom being burned.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a symbol, not the thing symbolized. You are confusing the map 
&gt; with the country. 
&gt; 
&gt; Burning the flag is a statement by the burner that they feel that the
&gt; symbol has become empty, and the freedom which the flag symbolizes is
&gt; gone or has been compromised in some manner. It's clearly a form of
&gt; political speech. True, It's a very strong statement, but strong 
&gt; political speech has been protected by the Constitution (at least up till 
&gt; now).
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Bush was a veteran, and Clinton was not.  I take it the ones who are
&gt; &gt; writing on this subject about how we should have the "freedom" to burn the
&gt; &gt; flag have never served in the military or for our country.   
&gt; 
&gt; You are mistaken - some of the people opposing your viewpoint have 
&gt; stated that they are veterans.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Being a veteran myself, I find it very distateful to allow anyone on our
&gt; &gt; soil to be allowed to "BURN" our symbol of freedom.  Think about the flag
&gt; &gt; for a moment and what it really stands for.  Does it not stand for freedom
&gt; &gt; and liberty?
&gt; 
&gt; It does *stand* for freedom and liberty, but only as long those 
&gt; values really exist. It *is* *not* freedom and libery in it's own
&gt; right.
&gt;  
&gt; When what the flag symbolizes is gone, it becomes just a piece of 
&gt; cloth. Burning this cloth draws attention to the loss. It is a dramatic
&gt; statement, but under certain circumstances an appropriate one.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Sorry, I just had to let this out.  I stand behind Bush on this one.  Don't
&gt; &gt; burn the flag unless you would like to live under another flag!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your opinion. You are of course free to express it. And 
&gt; I, and other thoughtful, freedom-loving Americans can oppose it.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about this:
&gt; 
&gt; Would you rather people did not burn the flag because:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. They'll be thrown in the slammer if they do.
&gt; 2. The revere the values for which it stands, and will not descrate a
&gt;    meaningful symbol of these values.
&gt; 
&gt; In (2), we can look at the (very rare) individuals who *do* burn the
&gt; flag, and determine for ourselves if they have a valid point to 
&gt; convey.  
&gt; 
&gt; In (1), we'll never know.
&gt; 
&gt; For Congress to deny the freedom to burn the flag is a desecration of what
&gt; the flag stands for - a descration of the flag by the government itself.
&gt; 

You Crazy Americans . . . I dont think anyone else in the world would 
give a fuck someone burnt their countries flag, certainly not in 
Australia.  What is it about your country?

My friend is a New Zealander.  When she was in school for a short 
while in America, she was beaten up for not reciting the "Pledge of 
Allegiance" in class everymorning.
