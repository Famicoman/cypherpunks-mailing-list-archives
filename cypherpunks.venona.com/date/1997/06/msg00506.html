We are pleased to announce the planned publication of a special issue of
the Jurimetrics Journal of Law, Science and Technology that will
exclusively address public key infrastructure (PKI) -- the law and
technology of certificate-based digital signatures and secure electronic
commerce. This announcement solicits articles for consideration for this
special Winter 1998 issue, which is intended as a forum for attorneys,
technologists, developers, and users interested in the legal aspects and
implications of PKI.

Jurimetrics Journal of Law, Science and Technology, published quarterly, is
the journal of the American Bar Association Section of Science and
Technology and the Center for the Study of Law, Science and Technology of
the Arizona State University College of Law.

The Information Security Committee, Electronic Commerce Division, Section
of Science and Technology of the American Bar Association (ISC) explores
and develops legal policy and foundation to support PKI and secure
electronic commerce. The ICS’s current endeavors include research and work
product concerning: accreditation of certification authorities, commercial
key escrow guidelines, PKI evidentiary issues, digital signature
legislative initiatives, CA and user liability, and other legal issues
relating to secure electronic commerce. The discussions are moderated by
the relevant Work Groups of the ISC, and the ISC is open to professionals
of all disciplines with similar interests. In August l996, the ISC
published the Digital Signature Guidelines.  See Tutorial, Table of
Contents, and List of Contributors of the Digital Signature Guidelines at
