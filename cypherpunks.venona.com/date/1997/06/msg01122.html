People sometimes wonder why I'm moving toward the "just kill them all"
position, meant rhetorically, of course. (I would never, never suggest
that anyone actually kill the criminals McCain or Kerrey, or the other 533
criminals, but they have surely all richly earned whatever befalls them.)

Besides the blizzard of new crypto laws, some proposed, some passed,
similar nonsense can be found in almost every other area of life. Here in
Kalifornia, not even the cops and district attorneys seem to know what's
happening with gun laws, knife laws, insult speech laws, and so on. And
here in my little piece of Paradise, a recent law made it illegal to
"discriminate" against those with rings through their noses, studs through
their tongues, etc. (Some of you, being "punks," may actually be so
adorned. I hope you understand the deeper point that what I do with my
property, including who I hire, is my business, not the "Committee Against
Appearance Discrimination's" bussiness.)

The real problem is that the thousands of professional politicians, the
organized crime families of politics, and the hundreds of thousands of
cops, narcs, judges, bureaucrats, drones, and other criminals keep on
writing more laws, trying to patch the broken aspects of society with more
and more laws. 

Anyway, one of my occasional interests is following the knife community.
After recent warnings that the knife laws in my area may make it illegal
to carry a folding knife either in my pocket ("concealed") or clipped to
my belt ("brandishment"), I started paying close attention to what the
clowns in Sacramento are doing to resolve this situation. As might be
expected, they are screwing things up further.

As with crypto, the laws keep getting more and more complex, with layers
upon layers of cruft making nearly any interpretation a DA (District
Attorney, or Prosecuting Attorney) might want to push possible. As the
famous saying by a corrupt (as most of them are) DA went, "I could get an
indictment against a ham sandwich if I wanted one.")

Here's an insight into the knife laws in California. It makes me want to
climb a tall tower and start shooting. (I won't, of course, but I am
confirmed in my view that the politicians in Sacramento and D.C. ought to
be disposed of as quickly as possble. Hang the bastards.)

&gt; &gt; I am publishing an article in the October 1997 edition of Knives
&gt; &gt; Illustrated, written by Chris Micheli, the gent in Sacramento who is
&gt; &gt; fighting the battle for Buck Knives. The Calif DA's association and the
&gt; &gt; Sheriffs are seeking to have that bill changed again. Why? They claim
&gt; &gt; everyone and his cousin is now on the streets using these knives in
&gt; &gt; combat. We all know this is bull pucky, but they want to change it back.

&gt; Latest news on AB78: After another conference with law &amp; order types,
&gt; they've removed from the bill the part that says it's OK to carry a
&gt; fixed blade knife in a container like a backpack, toolbox, purse,
&gt; etcetera. The part that decrminalizes folders is still there, but if you
&gt; buy a chef's knife in the mall, you can't carry it to your car in a
&gt; shopping bag. You'll have to carry it openly through the mall and scare
&gt; lots of people instead. 
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't a stretch. The Los Angeles public defender's office has a
&gt; pending case where they busted a homeless guy for having a steak knife
&gt; in his backpack. Unofficial word is that he's a little too crazy to
&gt; stand trial, but I can't get it in writing that they'll only do that to
&gt; crazy poor people, and crazy poor people need to eat, etcetera, too.
&gt; 
&gt; The law is an ass. I've squawked to the lobbyist, and my squawk to some
&gt; other people goes out tonight.
