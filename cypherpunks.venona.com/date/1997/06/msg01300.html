I'm reading a book, "Who Will Tell the Truth" with some very clear insights
into
How it All Works.  The bottom line is the Bottom Line and the reason the
crypto
debate is going this way is due to exactly one thing: Money.

I know there are those amongst this readership who feel that there is no
place for the usual political process in dealing with the crypto issues, but
that's not a universal or a given, nor is it necessarily practical in the long
run.  But within the existing structure the missing component in the debate is
the active participation of a lot of dollars.

The weight of Micro$osft + Netscape + (name your favorite list) is
miniscule, and their players woefully inexperienced,
 compared to McDonnell D., G.E. Fed., TRW., Lock/Martin, IBM, and others who
stand to gain hugely from a Federally-mandated and controlled PKI.  Those
heavyweights are all drinking buddies with the  other Washington sorts who
are in search of 
ever-expanding missions in life, and the result is a coterie who's primary
interest
isn't even remotely concerned with Child Pornography, Money Laundering, etc.
but their own aggrandizement measured in personal and corporate dollars.
There are no doubt 
massive investments being made by Industry in the conservative thinktanks
who produce the
intellectual fodder-de-jour that supports the position of this elite, and
overwhelm the
likes of McCain and Kerrey with
impossible-for-the-legislature-to-understand managed 
"information" which boils it all down to the 4 Horsemen arguments.

What's necessary here is a knowledgeable application of the same
techniques, a coalition
organization comprised of large business interests with an awareness of how
Bad this all is,
competing on the same turf.

Noble anarchist or Constitutional arguments, whining about our Rights and
such, are 
insignificant and irrelevant to the players.  

Who will belly up to the bar and provide leadership on terms that will
truly be effective?

&gt;The "Meeting of the Eight," formerly the G7, is happening in Denver.
&gt;Listening to what's coming out of it, it's apparent that the Four Horsemen
&gt;are front and center. Clinton is speaking of a network of banking and
&gt;communications policy coordinators, to detect and halt drug dealing, money
&gt;laundering, and nuclear terrorism.
&gt;
&gt;This fits with the details of reports about global wiretapping efforts,
&gt;about joint intelligence activities, and, of course, with the OECD/GAK laws
&gt;being proposed, passed, and about to be signed into law about "Key
&gt;Recovery" and "Trusted Third Parties."
&gt;
&gt;The fix is in.
&gt;
&gt;It probably won't be long before Stronghold is barred for export from
&gt;either Britain or RSA (the other one); both Tony Blair and Nelson Mandela
&gt;are Friends of Bill, so a few phone calls should take care of that little
&gt;problem. (And Norway and the other Scandinavian countries are part of the
&gt;global wiretap agreement, so I rather doubt free export of PGP 5.x code out
&gt;of Norway will be feasible, despite the OCR effort now underway there.)
&gt;
&gt;(Not that Clinton will mention Stronghold to Blair...that's far too much
&gt;microdetail. Jimmy Carter might have gotten involved at that level, but not
&gt;Bill. Details will be left to underlings.)
&gt;
&gt;The call to Japan, probably the visit by David Aaron, stopped NTT's plans
&gt;for exporting the RSA chip.
&gt;
&gt;Anguilla and other "offshore" havens, will be subject to the same kinds of
&gt;pressure. Mark my words.
&gt;
&gt;It's not hopeless. Physical havens are vulnerable, to all sorts of
&gt;pressures (I doubt many cryptographers want to set up shop in Libya or
&gt;Iraq, not that these places would be hospitable to Cypherpunks sorts of
&gt;goals and methods).
&gt;
&gt;Going underground, using the untraceable features of cyberspace, may be the
&gt;last, best hope.

&gt;There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
&gt;Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
