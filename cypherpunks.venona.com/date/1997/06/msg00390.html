&gt; &gt; Yes, he is guilty of murder and I would favour torturing him to death 
&gt; &gt; slowly, this is not emotional reactionism, merely a desire for justice 
&gt; &gt; and fair punishment.
&gt; 
&gt; You do not know for a fact if he is guilty of murder.  You only know that
&gt; he was judged guilty.  Whatever the truth is, you and I, and everyone else
&gt; discussing this, cannot know.  McVeigh himself knows if he did it.
&gt; Witnesses (if any) would also know.  This is all speculation.

I thought in my post I qualified that statement with a "If he did it" 
line, whatever, it doesn`t really matter, the government will always find 
someone to blame. From now on, in this thread, asssume McVeigh == 
"McVeigh, if he did it"

&gt; Personally, I didn't.  I don't call for slow torture because to me, it
&gt; isn't justice or injustice.  I was not affected by his actions.  If he did
&gt; set off the bomb, life in death, or execution is a valid punishment.  I do
&gt; question your reasoning for calling for torture though.  How is that fair
&gt; punishment and justice?

I don`t really judge it in terms of punishment or as justice or as "fair 
trade". McVeigh took an extreme criminal act of agression against 
innocent people, I believe that implicit in that act (once proven) is the 
removal of his rights, that includes the "right not to be tortured" &lt;tm&gt;.
I was not directly affected by his actions, and I`m not at all affected 
by images of death and destruction anyway, I don`t hate McVeigh, I don`t 
have any personal grudge against him or need to see him punished, I 
merely recognise that he has surrendered his rights, any punishment is 
acceptable, whether it is fitting or not is a different thread.

The only reason I have any reservations whatsoever about the death 
penalty in this particular case is because, although I personally believe 
McVeigh is guilty, there was enough reasonable doubt to get a not-guilty 
verdict.
