Your REFUND from IQ INTERNET IS HERE!

This message is for anyone who was rip’d off by IQ INTERNET  

You can now obtain a FULL Refund paid to these
Bastards by following these simple instructions.

I could also use some help in distributing this REFUND offer!
Please help me by mass emailing this out to the Internet.  I am sure
we could find “others” who would like a REFUND too! (g) LOL!

I just discovered a "way cool" crack for IQ DIRECT / WMRG COM., a pre-paid calling card company.  If you want FREE long distance to any where in the world here it is.!!!

Call 1-800-510-7941 the automated prompt will ask you for a pin number.

Now here is the "Way Cool" Crack ...The pin number is a 10 digit code, for example: 748-700-4162  The first 3 numbers is the 'batch" code and will always stay the same.
The "batch" codes seem to run sequentially. In other words 100, 101,112 ...748,749,....999 end.  The "batch" codes also represents dollars denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500!!! (lol G)

The second and third set of numbers are somewhat random.  However as in the example 748-700-4163, I know of people who have been able to pick up a lot of FREE time just by changing one number in the second or third set of numbers. 

When you dial the 1-800-510-7941 number the automated voice will allow you 5 attempts to enter the correct pin number.  You will be disconnected after the 5th attempt.  But hey, no problem!  Just call back and retry.  I have found on average that within the 10th attempt at entering a pin number, you will find an authorized pin number!

It is really a lot of fun!  Sort of like spinning the Wheel of Fortune and coming up with a jackpot of up to $500 in pre-paid long distance!

This crack is likely to end within 1 week of this posting 6/07/97. 

Do yourself a favor and Hurry!  

Let everyone know about this "limited" opportunity. (G)

Due to high call traffic you may run into busy signals  (lol &amp; G)!!!

$incerely,

Dialing For Dollars$$$
