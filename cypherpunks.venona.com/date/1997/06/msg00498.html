&gt; &gt; The prospectus is a legal document -- part of the contract between the
&gt; &gt; mutual fund and the customer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, the question is, should there be any legal constraints on the
&gt; &gt; "speech" in contracts?
&gt;
&gt; Of course, a contract is a binding document, that does not imply that
&gt; there should be any legal constraint on the speech within that contract.
&gt; If I sign a contract which says that I must kill myself on demand, and
&gt; the penalty for breach of contract in this case is a fine of say $5000, I
&gt; am certainly stupid if I sign such a contract, assuming that is that I am
&gt; logical and not suicidal, I must later decide if I value my life at over
&gt; $5000, I assure you, this is not a difficult question to answer ;-).

I don't know how they phrase it in the UK, but in the US such a contract
would violate "public policy" and is therefore unenforceable.

&gt; The point is that breach of contract shouldn`t be a criminal offence, it
&gt; is a civil offence, and the penalties for breach of contract should be
&gt; agreed during negotiation of that contract. Therefore, I must evaluate
&gt; for myself if I consider the contract to be reasonable and if I consider
&gt; the penalties for breach of that contract too great to risk incurring
&gt; such penaties. There is no reason to suggest that contractural speech is
&gt; protected in this fashion, as it is an agreement and not pure speech.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Can I sign a contract, and later be able to
&gt; &gt; say "Oh, *that* clause!  That was just a *joke*"?
&gt;
&gt; This is a straw man, there is no way you can equate contractural speech
&gt; and other forms of speech, one takes the form of an agreement, the civil
&gt; crime commited on breach of contract is not a form of speech, it is an
&gt; overt act which breaks that contract.

That's a very good point.  If I commit assault/battery on Kent, the
gubmint supposedly has jurisdiction because I've violated "king's peace".

If I advertise that "borshch cures cancer" and Kent buys some borshch
from me, and dies from cancer anyway, then what's the basis for the
gubmint's involvement?
