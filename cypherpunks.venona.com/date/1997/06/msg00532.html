&gt; &gt; &gt;Well I think that there are some that would confuse the issue between 1st
&gt; &gt; &gt;Amendment free speech and the issues surrounding fraud. Especially those
&gt; &gt; &gt;in government who write the laws that regulate commercial speech.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The mistake has been to extend "fraud" laws to non-contract situations,
&gt; &gt; e.g., ordinary speech (as distinguished from contracts).
&gt; 
&gt;   Any time that you see a thread in which Kent Crispin accuses someone
&gt; of trying to "muddy the waters" you can pretty much guarantee he is
&gt; trying to throw a logical curveball of his own.

The ones you really have to watch out for are my logical spitballs.  
But I am deeply flattered that you take me so seriously.

&gt;   Kent added some tripe to the thread supporting his favorite theme,
&gt; which is that it is the job of government to "enforce" contractual
&gt; agreements. Naturally, he also extends the format of these contracts
&gt; to include government authority to enforce criminal penalties for
&gt; statements made by the great grandfather of the second cousin of the
&gt; spouse of one of the person making the contract.

You are completely misrepresenting me here -- I distinctly said 
"grandmother of the first cousin".  And my favorite theme is from one 
of the Brandenberg Concertos.

&gt;   Follow any thread after a Crispin post and you will find people
&gt; arguing over issues he raises which have little basis in reality.

You have a point there.  You will search in vain for a stitch of 
reality in this post.

&gt; &gt; Contracts, with clearly stated conditions and with judgeable or
&gt; &gt; falsifiable/testable conditionals, are a matter for the courts (private
&gt; &gt; courts, in fact), but vague promises, advertisements, propaganda, etc. are
&gt; &gt; not.
&gt; 
&gt;   Dimitri wrote a couple of posts which dealt well with the original
&gt; concept of two parties agreeing on an arbitrator/judge to settle
&gt; contractual disputes (e.g. the court of Prince X) and the following
&gt; usurpment of these free-will agreements by people in power who decree
&gt; that _they_ are now the only valid arbitrator/judge in contractual
&gt; matters.

It's pointless to reply to Dimitri -- he filters my posts.  Of course 
I would be delighted to engage in a civilized discourse with him, but 
it's impossible.

&gt;   We now have a system where if someone breaks agreement with you the
&gt; government locks them in a cage where there is no possibility of them
&gt; paying you what they are contractually obligated to. The government
&gt; doesn't give a fat rat's ass what your desires are for resolution of
&gt; the dispute. They are always busy protecting the nebulous "other"
&gt; rather than someone real, with a real interest in the situation.

A revealing paragraph, indeed.

&gt;   The government mandates that contractual agreements must be 
&gt; settled in a forum where the corporation with an army of lawyers
&gt; can bury the attorney that Joe Average picked out of the yellow
&gt; pages. When you enter into a contractual agreement with someone who
&gt; has a guy named "Big Louie" as arbitrator, however, the government
&gt; calls it organized crime.
&gt;   Pardon me if I fail to see the distinction.

OK
