Hi Duffy,

First, let me say it has been quite pleasant dealing with you on this issue.
I appreciate your even-headed approach.

&gt; My most sincere apologies for any personal inconvenience to you in this
&gt; matter. The sole purpose of the request was just to ask you to delete a
&gt; link to a site. We didn't intend or foresee any problems with the
&gt; request, but there were and I believe a more detailed explanation is in
&gt; order.

Agreed.

&gt; We here at Telecode were notified by Mr. Lancaster several weeks ago
&gt; that he wished that the link(s) we had given to his site be removed. No
&gt; reason was given, and of course, none was required.

Unfortunately in this case my policy was diametricaly opposed to yours.
Unless somebody is a paying customer or has legal justification I don't
comply with a great many external requests, I try to make as few as possible
as well.

I support a wide range of users and they specificaly request that I keep
them up to date with what is going on in a variety of technology areas.
Not only do I send a copius amount of forwards from various mailing lists, 
print sources, etc. but I also keep a webpage with some critical links to
resources they have inquired about. Don's was one of them.

[Deleted chronology]

&gt; I also remarked that I would do my best to contact and ask that the link
&gt; be removed. I did this because it "appeared" to Mr. Lancaster that the
&gt; both yours and our site were somehow "connected". Of which, there are
&gt; not. We do not claim that there is any copyright infringement on you
&gt; part and we also state openly that your are the "true and rightful owner
&gt; of that page". We believe, because of the similarity of the pages, that
&gt; we had a "responsibility" at least to ask that you remove the link. So,
&gt; we did.

A sign of an honorable business.

&gt; Again, I apologize for any inconvenience in this matter.

Not a problem. Sounds like you have been the one inconvenienced by this
the most.
