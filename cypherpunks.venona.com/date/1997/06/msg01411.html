I truly admire how you (and others) infer what you have from my post.
Simply remarkable.

I will keep my statements short and direct for those of you who have had to
much coffee.

I support the constitution.  In the case of the first ammendment: The
freedom it allows you, or whoever, to send spam and indulge in child
pornography is the same freedom provided to those who say those ideas are
wrong.  Got it?

I did not intend to infer any sexuality of any kind.

The question still stands --- please try not to rant --- attempt to post
your constructive thoughs:

How do we deal with child pornography and free speech in such a way as to
allow both to exist and insure our children are not exposed to pornographic
material until they are at a maturity level where they can deal with it?

If pornography is the enemy of crypto then that is enemy that must be fought. 

A battle that must be won without killing the enemy to insure continued
free speech.  Quite a challenge I think.

Now, do you have any idea how to do that?

&gt;
&gt;No you don't.  You believe in free speach for the things that do not tweak
&gt;your worldview.  I am certainly willing to bet that if you had the chance
&gt;to remove the rights of the "bent" people from expressing their views, you
&gt;would not hesitate in the slightest.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I still am concerned about kids being subject to material that is
&gt;&gt; inappropriate for their age group (what ever that may be).  
&gt;
&gt;"Whatever that may be" is a very telling statement.  How can you tell what
&gt;is "appropreate" or "not".  What the media tells you?  What your religious
&gt;leaders tell you?  What the voices in your head tell you?  What the
&gt;government tells you?  All of those values are subjective.  They depend on
&gt;what you may or may not believe is "harmful".  Most of that is based on
&gt;cultural conditioning.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So how do I
&gt;&gt; insure that my son/daugher does not get their hands on _THIS_ material?
&gt;
&gt;Kill them now.  Stick them in a box and feed them through a slot in the
&gt;door. Gouge out their eyes. Cut off their hands.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Twenty seven years ago I took an oath to do whatever was needed to protect
&gt;&gt; and defend the constitution against all enemies (domestic and foreign)  But
&gt;&gt; what is the solution to this problem from a parents point of view?
&gt;
&gt;You view the constitution as a problem?  Free speach as a problem?
&gt;
&gt;Or maybe you have a problem that your children might learn about things
&gt;that you disapprove of?  Maybe they might read something that shows them
&gt;that sex is a part of life, not just something that is a side benefit of
&gt;marriage.  Maybe they might learn that sex is fun!  Maybe they will find
&gt;out that the religion their parents saddled them with is based on lies and
&gt;urban legend.  maybe they will find that their government is not so kind
&gt;and benevolent after all.  Maybe they will find out that their parents are
&gt;human and make mistakes.  Or maybe they will even figure out that the
&gt;material the parents are so afraid of are only harmful to the parents...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Simple
&gt;&gt; - control the material.  Make it like liquor, guns, booze.  Oops.. for some
&gt;&gt; reason this is a violation of the 1st amendment to!
&gt;
&gt;It is also an impossibility.  People have tried to control the natural
&gt;interest in sex since the dawn of time.  Has not worked yet.  Porn has
&gt;existed since man discovered woman.  Some of the earliest existing films
&gt;are porno movies.  What has changed is access and awareness.  Until
&gt;reletive reciently porn has been more underground.  But with the spread of
&gt;technology, it has become easier and easier to supply the demand for such
&gt;things.
&gt;
&gt;Or as a certain math professor once said... "Dirty books are fun!"
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Ok, my mistake, its my
&gt;&gt; problem.  That's easy, no Internet access.  Now my kid is at a
&gt;&gt; disadvantage!  I keep loosing here.  I don't like the way this is beginning
&gt;&gt; to feel!!
&gt;
&gt;Your kid is already at a disadvantage.  His parents have lost perspective.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm sure that the community on this list has discussed this problem at
&gt;&gt; length.  What is the best defense?  How do we get the message out or,
&gt;&gt; better yet, deliver it?  
&gt;
&gt;You assume that it actually is a problem.  Your moral qualms over pictures
&gt;of sexual activity does not a problem make.
&gt;
&gt;it is people like yourself who are activly destroying what little remains
&gt;of the constitution.  You want an exception for this and a rationalization
&gt;for that until thre is nothing left but the blandest and most tasteless
&gt;thoughts and speach.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Whatever that is, we need to do the same thing for the 2nd Ammendment, and
&gt;&gt; the 3rd, and so on.
&gt;
&gt;Like actually follow it?  Wow!  That would be a first.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The challenge to write code could be fun, but maybe we should use our
&gt;&gt; collective wisdom to deliver the best of the best solutions (there may be
&gt;&gt; more than one) to our elected officials.  Load their mailboxes up with
&gt;&gt; solutions to problems.  Sooner or later more than one of them is going to
&gt;&gt; think its his/her idea and push it along.  Web sites can be set up to
&gt;&gt; assist them with details.  I'm sure you get the idea.
&gt;
&gt;You are talking to the wrong group of people.  What you are asking for is
&gt;a way to censor the masses.
&gt;
&gt;Anything an adult can get, a child can get.
&gt;
&gt;Attempts to censor children and control what they hear, see and feel are
&gt;vague attempts to do the same to adults.  You cannot control the
&gt;information feed to children without controling the information feed for
&gt;adults. (But deep down in your heart you would like to see that as well.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just another citizen wondering if anything is going to be left for our
&gt;&gt; grandchildren.
&gt;
&gt;You think this information will harm them?  Actually the control freak
&gt;mentality you want to impose is far far worse.  In actuality, much of the
&gt;problems you would like to blame on porn are, in actuality, borne out of
&gt;this country's hypocracy and neurosis about sex and sexuality.  the reason
&gt;people are so fucked up about fucking is because they have been taught
&gt;that sex is somehow wrong and shameful and dirty.  That appreciating the
&gt;beauty of the sexual act is somehow more vile and disgusting than showing
&gt;someone shot full of holes.
&gt;
&gt;I think you need to examine WHY this information makes you uncomfortable.
&gt;You might learn something about yourself.  But don't expect us to help
&gt;inflict your sickness on the minds of your children.
