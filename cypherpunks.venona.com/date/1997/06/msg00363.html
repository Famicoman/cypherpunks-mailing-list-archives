&gt; Subject: Re: Webpage picketing (fwd)

&gt; Well this is why I had wanted to set the analogies aside. There are some
&gt; real diferences between cyberspace and your metaspace analogy of the
&gt; picket line. In cyberspace there is no sidewalk for your picket to stand
&gt; and for me to pay as little or as much attention as I wish.

But there is, the publicly funded routers on the publicly funded network
which are handling public traffic sitting in nice little queues just waiting
to be processed.

Perhaps a slightly more complicated setup might make it clearer. Consider
that we have some length of fiber laying from Chicago to Salt Lake City.
That fiber is fully owned/funded by the federal government. The two routers
on the end of the cable are also fully owned. Now from those routers extends
another network cable that goes to fully privately owned networks. Now in
Salt Lake City there is a young 14 year old girl that just took an at home
pregnancy test. It turned up positive and she has pretty much lost it. Now
in Chicago there is a webpage for an abortion clinic. Her sister lives in
Chicago. The girl gets on her trusty little bit-pusher and proceeds to
contact that page from a lookup done in Yahoo. Now at this point her parents
still think that what you don't know can't hurt you and her sister has a
vistor for a few days that summer.

Now ask yourself, does a anti-abortion group have any claim to providing
that young girl alternate information that is not pro-abortion?

Perhaps this will better exemplify the demarcation I am making. I admit it
is a thin line, but that is all it takes.

&gt; A more closer analogy between cyberspace and metaspace is that your
&gt; picketors are not standing off to the side but are blocking the door and
&gt; the only way I can enter is to read their signs first. This is the point
&gt; where your picketors have oversteped the bounds of their 1st Amendment
&gt; rights. While the have the right to picket infront of the store they
&gt; cannot interfere with the comming and goings of the customers. The has
&gt; been well tested in the courts. The problem with extending the picket
&gt; analogy to cyberspace is there are no sidewalks. It's all or nothing.
&gt; Either you are blocking the door or you are not

Not at all, blocking implies a stoppage NOT a delay. I suggest you sit
outside an abortion clinic when the picketers are there. I assure you they
are up close and personal. The old ruling of 15ft. seperation was over-turned
just this year I believe. It is true that they may not block you but they are
allowed to delay your journey slightly with civil coverage. I further belive
the court would look at the nature of the Internet and the structure of the
web and determine that a single page at the very beginning or perhaps a
small splash screen first would not be an unwarranted imposition.

I want to make it clear, I am a strict Constitutionalist. I don't see the
government having the delegated authority to spend any public money on the
Internet, human cloning, BATF, DEA, etc. I believe strongly that such
enterprises are best left fully in the state and individuals care. I most
definitely believe that were the 9th and 10th Amendment interpreted and used
actively we would see a massive decline in government intervention and as a
consequence lower taxes.
