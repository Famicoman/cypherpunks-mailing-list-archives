Far better to have more users even if they're not perfectly secure.
They can always get more secure later, and getting people to use crypto
now will mean more people who care when the government tries to ban it.

For situations like the example you gave (lots of users on
a multi-user machine) they'd still be way better off using a shared
copy of PGP than with no encryption at all.
