&gt; &gt; Nope.  Not any of those things (Gee, there's that "statist" word
&gt; &gt; again.  There must be a playbook somewhere).
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. It's from the same playbook which says I now get to call you a "twit".

Uh oh.  Must of touched a nerve...

&gt; &gt; More a "security
&gt; &gt; analyst" notion.  See the cute little book "Chaos and the Capital
&gt; &gt; Markets" (I don't have it handy so I can't give you the author.)
&gt; &gt; Anyway, he makes an empirical of security prices, and demonstrates
&gt; &gt; that they are chaotic.  It was more oriented to practitioners, not
&gt; &gt; theorists...
&gt; 
&gt; Bark. Chaos theory has nothing to say about the capital markets practically
&gt; by definition, but that's a "security analyst" notion, so you probably
&gt; wouldn't understand it.

Sorry.  It's Edgar Peters, "Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets", 
John Wiley, 1991.  I'm sure you will rush out and buy a copy :-)

&gt; &gt; Chaotic is not the same as stochastic.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, chaotic behavior is a subset of stochastic behavior. I stand by
&gt; what I said. 

Clearly, you don't know what you are talking about.  Strictly 
speaking, chaotic behavior (as mathematically defined in chaos theory) is 
completely *deterministic*, not random.  The conundrum is that 
chaotic behavior *looks* random, and indeed, it can be very hard to tell 
if a set of data is generated by a determinstic chaotic procedure or a 
stochastic procedure.

Pretty pictures of Mandelbrot and Julia sets are generated by selecting 
points *determinstically*, iterating through a *determinsitic* algorithm, 
and looking at the result.  It's the mathematics that creates the 
complexity, not randomness.

(To be fair, of course, I must also state that some fractals are 
generated by starting with random numbers and running them through 
some algorithm.)

&gt; Just because a random variable is predictable within certain
&gt; parameters doesn't mean that you can call say, every flip of a coin 100
&gt; times. When you get to the limit of predictability, you are as "efficient"
&gt; as you can get.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There are obviously stochastic
&gt; &gt; factors in markets.  Equally obviously, they are not the only factors.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure. What? The devine right of kings? The inherent good of the
&gt; surveillance state? I say that stochasticity, including chaos, is the only
&gt; factor that matters.

No, you described it just above when you said "just because a random 
variable is predictable within certain parameters".  So, for example, 
I know that if a head is worth $1 and a tail is worth -$1, my net 
worth won't jump by $100 on a single toss.

&gt; &gt; The fact that markets demonstrate a chaotic element is potentially
&gt; &gt; exploitable as a trading strategy.
&gt; 
&gt; That statement, is, of course, an another oxymoron, just like "market 
&gt; control".

I don't know whether you are expressing your flatulent ignorance of
chaos theory, or whether you are referring to the term "trading
strategy".  I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the
latter, and agree that the term "trading strategy" is at least 
suspicious. 

&gt; &gt; I heard that's why trading houses
&gt; &gt; were hiring physicists, incidentally -- most of the expertise in
&gt; &gt; Chaos Theory was developed in the context of physics.
&gt; 
&gt; Rediculous. Most of the "expertise" in chaos "theory" is in the hands of
&gt; dillitantes who like to draw pretty pictures. 

A lot of those, for sure.  But Mandelbrot did some of his first work
on chaos studying cotton prices with Hendrik Houthakker, a Harvard
economist.  But how about Edward Lorenz (of the "Lorenz attractor")
studying weather, studies of turbulence, Feigenbaum &amp; Co at Los
Alamos, the Dynamical Systems Group at Santa Cruz, etc etc.  The 
pretty pictures are pretty, but even I can do those.

&gt; Most of the physicists hired
&gt; by Wall Street were people who discovered market analogs to physical
&gt; processes. A friend of mine, for example, who used Monte Carlo simulations
&gt; to analyze sonar returns, and now uses Green's functions to get faster
&gt; results on interest rates and total return scenarios on bonds. Or another,
&gt; who did 2D magnetohydrodynamic code once, and now does fun stuff in the
&gt; currency markets.

Sure, that too.

&gt; The problem with simulating a market with emergent systems is that you
&gt; can't say anything about a given market when the simulation is over. Just
&gt; about the simulation. Otherwise (duh?) it's not chaotic enough. Which, by
&gt; the way, was my point. When you get to "chaos", you're as "efficient" as
&gt; you can go.

I wasn't referring to simulating markets; I was referring to studying 
real markets.

[...]

&gt; &gt; That's "Crispin", Mr. Applethwaite.  I hate being mislabeled.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah. Another ad hominem. 

No, just a joke.  Boy, I must really have hit a nerve.  Sensitive big 
ego, perhaps?

&gt; See "twit", above. You're ugly, and your mother
&gt; dresses *you* funny, too. By the way, I'm sorry I misspelled your name. For
&gt; some reason, it seems I didn't respect you enough to get it right...

That's ok.  I just attribute it to a fragile ego, anyway.

&gt; &gt; I never said anything about planned economies being efficient.  In
&gt; &gt; fact, I never mentioned planned economies at all.
&gt; 
&gt; You said that "chaotic" markets aren't efficient. I said exactly the
&gt; opposite. That they are the ultimate in efficiency, and that if you believe
&gt; that chaotic markets are not efficient, you must favor planned economies,
&gt; because they're the only alternative. 

It's understandable that you might make this mistake, given your 
misunderstanding of dynamic systems.

&gt; I figure this tendency towards
&gt; stringent control must be from where you work or something. Oops. Another
&gt; ad hominem. So sorry. They must be in the air this evening.

That nerve must really be throbbing.  Sorry.

&gt; &gt; Obviously I can't "prove" markets are not efficient -- that's an
&gt; &gt; empirical matter, not a mathematical matter.  However, no one can
&gt; &gt; prove they are efficient, either (that's why it's the "Efficient
&gt; &gt; Market *Hypothesis*").  There are many other examples of persistent
&gt; &gt; inefficiencies in markets,  the presidential election year cycle
&gt; &gt; being the first to come to mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Right. And the increasing American importation of bananas throughout the
&gt; 20th century caused an increase in suicide. Another informal fallacy.
&gt; You're nine for nine tonight, Mr. Ch^hispin. Of course there are actual
&gt; exceptions to the efficient market hypothesis, fools' markets being the
&gt; most famous example.

You don't like my example, but agree to my point.  I like that.  So 
now we both agree that "there are actual exceptions to the efficient 
market hypothesis"  (your words).

&gt; However, the crash of any given fool's market is
&gt; completely unpredictable, and, as such, is as efficient a price as you're
&gt; going to get, paradoxically. Which was my point.

You, unfortunately, misunderstand your own example.  It actually is a 
paradox. 

&gt; &gt; [interesting but besides the point argument deleted]
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, it was the *whole* point, but you didn't get it. Another one of
&gt; those "security analyst" notions, which kind of blew by you, in what seems
&gt; to be a rather breezy evening in your neck of the woods...

Plenty of hot air around, as you speak.

&gt; &gt; This inability of a hierarchy to handle as much information or resources as
&gt; &gt; a geodesic is, of course, a major problem with key escrow,
&gt;
&gt; No, it's a theoretical problem that has no impact on practical key recovery
&gt; systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay. I'll tell you this one, for fun, too, since you don't get *it*
&gt; either. In a geodesic network, a single node can not possibly process all
&gt; the information in the network. It chokes, and the network routes around
&gt; it. 
&gt;
&gt; You can bet that any key escrow agent would be innundated with
&gt; surviellance requests 

No, I wouldn't bet that.  Even a lame theory a looks good against a
braindead strawman. 

[rest of braindead strawman deleted]

&gt; &gt; "Whip me! Beat me! Savage me in Cypherpunks!"
&gt; 
&gt; Just lay there and take it, slave. You know you love it, or you wouldn't be
&gt; here.

Actually the most entertaining thing is watching blowhards at work. 
And one thing for sure, Bob -- for all your failings, you *do* know how
to blow.
