&gt; &gt;paul@fatmans.demon.co.uk pissed off Hallam-Baker to the
&gt; &gt;extent that gave up all pretense hiding his support for
&gt; &gt;a New World Order, and wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, like I wrote in "The Laird of the new world order".
&gt; ...
&gt; They said they worked for freedom but they had another plan.
&gt; The only new world order is, obey your Uncle Sam.

 I would like to see the complete work, if you have it
available online. 

&gt; Must be in deep, deep cover.

  I'm a conspiracy theorist. Any particular Crayola colour you
would like me to use to draw the links between yourself and
the Cabal?
 
&gt; I was pointing out that the attempt to claim that the rest of
&gt; us poor slobs didn't see Jim Bell as a shining Messiah was
&gt; not because we were too stupid to understand him as claimed.

  I once recorded a tune called, "He used to take acid, and now
he's found God, but he's still got that look in his eye."
  I can't deny that Jim Bell seems to have "that look" in his eye.
 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't believe that people
&gt; &gt;&gt; are fit judges of their own cause as Bell and you do.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So we should only fight for other people's causes, and not
&gt; &gt;our own? Or not fight at all?
&gt; 
&gt; I think that before you murder someone because you think they
&gt; are wrong you need to at the very least put the matter to an impartial
&gt; arbitrator.

  I believe that the AP system pretty much spreads out the
"arbitration" in much the same manner that the electoral system
does. To me, it is similar to the inter-family dynamics that
take place in Dr. Kevorkian's work, only on a more pervasive
scale.
  I have always seen Jim Bell's work as a theoretical exercise
that deserved a more serious analysis than he, himself, gave it.
It pushed the envelope of issues that need to be dealt with, and
did so in a manner that went beyond seemingly mundane matters
wherein one could easily dismiss the long-term consequences of
the train of logic involved.
  An analogy might be made to those who dismiss a little ass-
grabbing as inconsequential when compared to rape, as opposed 
to those who view it as a precursor to rape.

  Despite my sometimes caustic, irreverent demeanor, I enjoy 
your posts, as they show a thoughtfulness which goes beyond
some of the "Oh yeah! Sez who! Yo' mamma!" threads that 
sometimes prevail on various lists.
  So, don't change on my account, I hate you just the way you
are.  (Please note my aversion to adding little 'happy faces'
to my posts. Humor be humor.)
