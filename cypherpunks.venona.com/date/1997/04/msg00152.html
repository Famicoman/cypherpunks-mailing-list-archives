&gt; &gt;     Gee. I too wonder about that, since I am pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt;sure the Feds don't have to time to read the cypherpunks
&gt; &gt; &gt;list.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is simply not true. Various government agencies/employees read the
&gt; &gt; Cypherpunks list.
&gt; 
&gt; Absolutely! I know quite a few who do.
&gt; 
&gt; Before Oaklahoma I spent some time trying to persuade people to take
&gt; notice of the net.activities of the likes of Ahmed Cosar, an agent
&gt; of the Turkish secret service who posted inflamatory material about
&gt; Armenia into various newsgroups under the name Hasan B. Mutlu and 
&gt; Serdar Argic. I'd guess that at this point the FBI has its own
&gt; version of DejaNews.

Of course, everything Serdar Argic posted to Usenet was 100% documented truth.

The FBI would be better advised to look a close look at the terrorist activity
of one Ray "Arsen" Arachelian, an ASALA sympathizer in the employ of Earthweb,
LLP.

&gt; 
&gt; Its not hard to do analysis of USEnet, a bit of simple graph
&gt; analysis. The real loons tend to turn up on the net.kooks 
&gt; list quites quickly in any case.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is not a matter of thinking ourselves self-important; this is just a
&gt; &gt; simple observation that there aren't a lot of places with more incisive
&gt; &gt; analysis of issues of importance to these folks. 
&gt; 
&gt; Plus not everyone in the agencies are pro the administration line. 
&gt; I've met plenty of CIA and NSA people who think the GAK idea a
&gt; pointless and futile waste of time. 
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect that most analysts read c'punks for the same reason I
&gt; do, to get the widest possible range of views on what the posibilities
&gt; for the future are.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Political advocacy is one thing, but making threats, even veiled ones, is
&gt; &gt; another matter.
&gt; 
&gt; Absolutely, that is why I was keen for people to oppose Bell's views.
&gt; If his ramblings had gone unchallenged he would now be being
&gt; presented as a representative of Cypherpunk/ pro-crypto views.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides anything else Bell was like the party bore with a 
&gt; hobby horse he just has to talk about. I'm somewhat more
&gt; sensitive than most to advocates of murdering government 
&gt; officials, some of my relatives are in government and have 
&gt; had well publicised assasination attempts against them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think that Bell's on-list comments may well have been protected
&gt; speech but I'm not sure about his off list comments. I'm scanning
&gt; through my old mail files at the moment for missives from Bell
&gt; re-reading them. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think that Bell's posts were entirely different from Tim's or
&gt; for that matter almost every other person on the list. Tim 
&gt; demonstrated that a covert information sales organisation was
&gt; possible with Blacknet but he never advocated setting it up. 
&gt; Indeed part of the point was the ethical responsibilities. Bell
&gt; on the other hand was likely to respond to any post with his
&gt; AP piece. I have throughout considered these to be incitement to 
&gt; murder.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems quite likely that Bell may have made a statement to an
&gt; IRS official that in the context of his authoring the AP piece
&gt; may have constituted a threat. If he spouted "Common law court" 
&gt; theories as often to the IRS as he did AP on cypherpunks he would
&gt; certainly have been marked for scrutiny. Its not hard to 
&gt; connect with his AP piece which has been all over USEnet. According
&gt; to the story they got it from a copy left behind in Bell's 
&gt; seized Honda.
