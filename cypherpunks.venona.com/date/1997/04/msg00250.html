Now, how do we get all of these people to use PGP for their e-mail?

(Also interesting to note is the fact, that they'll use 128 bit
crypto, regardless of what the US gov thinks about it...:))

 In&gt; Sweden Gets Wired With Netscape (04/03/97; 8:30 p.m. EST) By
 In&gt; Douglas Hayward , TechWire

 In&gt; STOCKHOLM -- Netscape is negotiating an innovative deal with
 In&gt; the Swedish national postal service aimed at creating a
 In&gt; national intranet covering the whole of Sweden.

 In&gt; Sweden Post plans to use Netscape's Communicator browser and
 In&gt; SuiteSpot server software to offer Swedish households and
 In&gt; small businesses intranet and Internet access services,
 In&gt; according to observers familiar with the proposed deal, which
 In&gt; is worth more than $10 million.

 In&gt; The postal service would use the Netscape Directory Services
 In&gt; product to create a single "white pages" facility covering all
 In&gt; Swedish households wishing to join the scheme, which would
 In&gt; potentially create a national intranet, observers said.

 In&gt; All households joining the network would be given by Sweden
 In&gt; Post electronic mailboxes and a copy of Netscape's
 In&gt; Communicator browser software. The postal service would manage
 In&gt; households' electronic mail services in a manner similar to
 In&gt; the way it manages paper-based mail services. Sweden's total
 In&gt; population is about 8.8 million people.

 In&gt; The email addresses issued by Sweden Post would mimick the
 In&gt; real-life address of each participating household. The goal is
 In&gt; to issue more than 1 million email addresses by this summer,
 In&gt; said Sweden Post spokesman Jan Andersson.

 In&gt; "As far as I know, this is the first time a PTT has offered
 In&gt; this kind of service," Andersson said.

 In&gt; For households without networked PCs, Sweden Post would
 In&gt; translate the incoming email and send it as separate faxes or
 In&gt; print out the messages and send them through the paper-based
 In&gt; mail system, he said.

 In&gt; In addition to email, services offered to users will include
 In&gt; electronic shopping, Web access, Web publishing facilities,
 In&gt; and the ability to set up secure electronic trading outlets.
 In&gt; The service will use 128-bit encryption software and digital
 In&gt; certificates to ensure security.

 In&gt; The idea that each assigned email address would be similar to
 In&gt; the recipient's street address is troubling, said Ian Walden,
 In&gt; a specialist in IT law for the London-based law firm of Tarlo
 In&gt; Lyons. The plan may even violate the European data protection
 In&gt; directive, a 1995 law that is in effect in all 15 nations in
 In&gt; the European Union, he said.

 In&gt; "Is it necessary to make a direct link in the email address to
 In&gt; the physical location? I think it's dangerous," Walden said,
 In&gt; "and I would warn Sweden Post to reconsider such an approach."

 In&gt; Netscape will supply Sweden Post with browser and server
 In&gt; software for an initial fee of roughly $10 million under the
 In&gt; proposed deal, which was agreed in principle early March but
 In&gt; has yet to be finalized. Sweden Post already uses Netscape's
 In&gt; electronic publishing and merchant software in its Web-based
 In&gt; electronic shopping mall -- known as Torget -- under a deal
 In&gt; signed last year.

 In&gt; Sweden Post, which recently lost its monopoly of mail delivery
 In&gt; services in parts of Sweden, wants to become a major player in
 In&gt; the Internet services market in order to compensate for any
 In&gt; decline in its traditional business as a result of the growth
 In&gt; of electronic communications.

 In&gt; "Sweden Post realizes that either it gets into the electronic
 In&gt; services market in a big way, or it loses a lot of business to
 In&gt; Internet service providers. And for Netscape, deals like this
 In&gt; with utilities are a perfect way to overcome Microsoft's
 In&gt; greater marketing power among ISPs," said the observer.
 In&gt; "Netscape believes that if it can to sign up the utilities, it
 In&gt; won't have to worry too much about the ISPs in Europe."

 In&gt; The initial licensing fee would not include the cost of future
 In&gt; software upgrades nor the cost of royalty fees for copies of
 In&gt; browser software distributed to households by Sweden Post.
 In&gt; Lennart Gren, Netscape's director for the Nordic region
 In&gt; including Sweden, declined to confirm that the deal had been
 In&gt; agreed.

 In&gt; Netscape has been targeting utilities and telcos in Europe for
 In&gt; some time. In February, the German national telco, Deutsche
 In&gt; Telekom, said it would promote Communicator as its browser of
 In&gt; choice. The telco added that it would use Netscape's intranet
 In&gt; suite as its product of choice when building intranets for
 In&gt; corporate customers.
