[I think the other exceprt was based on this one, from Charles IX of France in 1563]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Printing press registration may prove essential in making printing and literacy managable <BR>
on an international basis. We are not the only country wrestling <BR>
with the public safety implications of  printing presses. <BR>
France, Israel and Russia recently imposed import and domestic <BR>
use restrictions. Several Asian, South American and African <BR>
countries have had similar restrictions in place for years. Others<BR>
may impose them as  printing presses proliferate.<BR>
<BR>
For many overseas, as well as here, the logic of the need to <BR>
balance business imperatives with public safety concerns argues <BR>
for printing press registration. The European Union and other confederations <BR>
are considering printing press registration-based infrastructures. The world's major <BR>
standards bodies are designing future standards so that printing press registration <BR>
can be accommodated.<BR>
<BR>
International standards and protocols for printing press registration may prove <BR>
essential to hand off national restrictions on  printing and literacy, to <BR>
promote a broad export market for printing presses and to establish <BR>
a infrastructure acceptable for general international <BR>
use. This would accelerate the realization of the promise of information <BR>
technology, and that would be in everyone's best interest.<BR>
<BR>
Working in partnership, government and industry together need to <BR>
lay the foundation necessary to sustain and strengthen information <BR>
security for America. I wish to emphasize that the infrastructure for <BR>
printing press registration will be built by industry as a commercial venture. <BR>
This task is huge. Collaboration among many partners will be <BR>
essential if we are to establish a PPRI that promotes the use of <BR>
printing and literacy worldwide.<BR>
