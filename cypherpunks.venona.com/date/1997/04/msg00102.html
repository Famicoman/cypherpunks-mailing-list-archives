No, there is *not* an echo in here...


                 The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                              Presents
                              (Again!)
                           Mr. Stewart Baker,
                           Steptoe &amp; Johnson
         formerly General Counsel, the National Security Agency

            (who, along with the staff of the Harvard Club,
        was unable to get into Boston for April's DCSB meeting
              because of the April Fool's day snowstorm...)

         "The Clinton Administration's Latest Encryption Policy
                and What It Means for Digital Commerce"



                        Tuesday, May 6, 1997
                               12 - 2 PM
                   The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                     One Federal Street, Boston, MA



Mr. Baker will discuss the details of the Clinton Administration's latest
encryption policy, which seeks to encourage "key recovery" encryption by
offering special export privileges to companies that support key-recovery
systems.  He will also discuss the reaction of American high-tech
companies, foreign governments and consumers.

Mr. Baker, formerly General Counsel of the National Security Agency, has an
international and technology practice at Steptoe &amp; Johnson in Washington,
DC. He is a frequent contributor to WIRED and other publications on topics
such as encryption, national security and Internet law.

This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, May 6, 1997 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$27.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch.
;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets and ties for men,
and "appropriate business attire" for women.

We will attempt to record this meeting and put it on the web in RealAudio
format at some future date

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really*
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, May 3, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

NOTE: If we already have your check for April, and you're still coming, you
*don't* need to send another one. :-)

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Planned speakers for DCSB are:

June      Philip A. DesAutels  W3C Digital Signature Initiative
July      Win Treese           TLS, Digital Commerce, and Export Issues
August    Duncan Frissell*     MarketEarth
September Christof Paar        Elliptic Curve Cryptography
October   Peter Cassidy*       Military Fiat and Digital Commerce

*Invited

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, &lt;mailto: rah@shipwright.com&gt; .

For more information about the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, send
"info dcsb" in the body of a message to &lt;mailto: majordomo@ai.mit.edu&gt; .
If you want to subscribe to the DCSB e-mail list, send "subscribe dcsb" in
the body of a message to &lt;mailto: majordomo@ai.mit.edu&gt; .

We look forward to seeing you there!

Cheers,
Robert Hettinga
