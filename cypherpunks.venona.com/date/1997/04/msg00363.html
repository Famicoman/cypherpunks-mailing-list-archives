JOIN SILICON VALLEY INTERNET POLICY LEADER ANNA ESHOO (D-CA) Live ONLINE!

Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA), walks point for Silicon Valley on
Internet policy issues.  Her career has been marked by outspoken
positive positions on Internet policy, but also for her groundbreaking
work of making the Internet a tool for servicing her constituents
better.

Rep. Eshoo will hold a live online interactive 'town hall meeting'
at democracy.net on Wednesday April 16 at 8:30 pm Eastern (5:30 pm Pacific).

The town hall meeting, moderated by Wired Magazine's Todd Lappin, will be
completely virtual.  The discussion will be cybercast live via RealAudio,
and listeners can join a simultaneous interactive chat discussion and pose
questions to Rep. Eshoo.

This is a unique opportunity for Internet users to discuss current Internet
issues, including how Congress can better communicate with the public
using the Internet, the chances for online speech legislation in the 105th
Congress, Congress' agenda for encryption policy reform, and others.

Details on the event, including instructions on how you can submit questions
in advance, are attached below.

BACKGROUND

  "We need to send a clear, unscrambled message to Washington that our
   nation's encryption policy needs to be reformed, and reformed now."
               -- Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), SAFE Forum, July 1, 1996


Given the 14th District's concentration of high-tech industries, it is
not surprising that Rep. Eshoo serves on the House Committee on
Commerce. Her subcommittee assignments on this committee include the
Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, as
well as the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment.  The Commerce
Committee has policy making  power over high technology, biotechnology,
public health, and the environment.

Through her seat on the Commerce Committee, Rep. Eshoo is well positioned
to assist high technology interests in her district. She fought hard to
ensure that securities litigation reform and telecommunications reform
were signed into law. Rep. Eshoo has introduced the Online Parental
Control Act to fight government censorship and encourage parents to use
technology to control their children's access to online materials. She
has led the fight to improve the Food and Drug Administration's product
review process and played an instrumental role in securing the $238
million B Factory for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

In addition, Rep. Eshoo has pushed to loosen costly export controls on
high technology products, make NASA contractors more liable for the
costs of failing to comply with their contract requirements, and
prevent government laboratories from competing with private industry.
She also played a key role in stopping the Financial Accounting
Standards Board from adopting a rule requiring businesses to charge
stock options against earnings, a move which could have seriously
curtailed the growth of small firms and start-up businesses,
particularly in the high technology industry.

DEMOCRACY.NET STATISTICS

In the two weeks following the original Pro-CODE cybercast hearing,
over eight times as many people (804) listened to the RealAudio archive
than could have fit into the room at the hearing itself!

The hearing transcript continues to be extremely popular, with the
testimony of Jim Barksdale (CEO, Netscape) and  Louis Freeh (Director,
FBI) counting as the two most popular hearing witnesses to listen to.
Over a quarter of our visitors to the hearing archives stop to listen
to Barksdale and Freeh's takes on the encryption debate.

Whether you're a concerned citizen who can't get to Washington, a
student researching the topic of privacy, or a reporter just following
the debate, these archives are here for you.  You can experience
Government Without Walls at the March 19th hearing cybercast archive at
