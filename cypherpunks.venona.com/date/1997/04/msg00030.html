[From CDT.]

105th CONGRESS                                                  DRAFT 3/12/97

1st Session                 H.R. _________________

                   ________________________________________

Mr. _________________ of _________________ introduced the following
bill;  which was referred to the Committee on _____________________


                                A BILL

     To enable the development of a key management infrastructure for
public-key-based encryption and attendant encryption products that will
assure that individuals and businesses can transmit and receive
information electronically with confidence in the information's
confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity, and that
will promote timely lawful government access.

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

                   TITLE I -- GENERAL PROVISIONS

SEC. 101.  SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Electronic Data Security Act of 1997".

SEC. 102.  FINDINGS

The Congress finds the following:

(A)  The development of the information superhighway is fundamentally
changing the way we interact. The nation's commerce is moving to
networking.  Individuals, government entities, and other institutions
are communicating across common links.

(B)  The Internet has provided our society with a glimpse of what is
possible in the information age, and the demand for information access
and electronic commerce is rapidly increasing.  The demands are arising
from all elements of society, including banks, manufacturers, service
providers, state and local governments, and educational institutions.

(C)  Today, business and social interactions occur through face-to-face
discussions, telephone communications, and written correspondence.  Each
of these methods for interacting enables us to recognize the face, or
voice, or written signature of the person with whom we are dealing. It
is this recognition that permits us to trust the communication.

(D)  In the information age, however, those personal attributes will be
replaced with digital equivalents upon which we will rely.  Electronic
digital transmissions, through which many businesses and social
interactions will occur, inherently separate the communication from the
person, forsaking confidence once derived from a handshake or a signed
document.

(E)  At the same time, society's increasing reliance on information
systems in this new environment exposes U.S. citizens, institutions, and
their information to unprecedented risks.

(F)  In order for the global information infrastructure and electronic
commerce to achieve their potential, information systems must e imbued
with the attributes that overcome these risks and must provide trusted
methods to identify users.

(G)  Cryptography can meet these needs.  Cryptography can be used to
digitally sign communications ore electronic documents such that a
recipient can be confident that any message he or she received could
only have come from the apparent sender.  Moreover, cryptography is an
important tool in protecting the confidentially of wire and electronic
communications and stored data.  Thus,. there is a national need to
encourage the development, adoption, and use of cryptographic products
that are consistent with the foregoing considerations and are
appropriate for use both in domestic and export markets by the United
States Government.

(H)  The lack of a key management infrastructure impedes the use
cryptography and, there fore, the potential of electronic commerce.
Users cannot encrypt messages without keys, therefore, they need a
secure and standardized mechanism for the generation of keys, storage of
keys, and transfer of keys between users.  There is currently no
standardized mechanism for the generation of keys, storage of keys, and
transfer of keys between users.  There is currently no standardized
method in the private sector to accomplish all of these tasks, thus
users must individually assume these burdens or forego the use of
cryptography.

(I)  Industry must work with government to develop a public-key-based
key management infrastructure and attendant products that will ensure
participants can transmit, receive, and use information electronically
with confidence in the information's integrity, confidentiality,
authenticity, and origin, while also allowing timely lawful government
access.

(J)  To this end, the government should issue appropriate public key
encryption standards for federal systems and encourage the development
of interoperable private sector standards for use across border.
However, the architecture(s) the government endorses in its standards
must permit the use of any encryption algorithm.

(K)  To effectively serve the public, such a key management
infrastructure must be founded upon a system of trusted service
providers to ensure acceptable standards of security, reliability, and
interoperability.

(L)  While cryptographic products and services are useful for protecting
information and its authenticity, such products also can be sued by
terrorists, organized crime syndicates, drug trafficking organizations,
and other dangerous and violent criminals to avoid detection and to hide
evidence of criminal activity, thereby jeopardizing effective law
enforcement, public safety, and national security.

(M)  Any effective key management infrastructure must not hinder the
ability of government agencies, pursuant to lawful authority, to
decipher in a timely manner and obtain the plaintext of communications
and stored data.

SEC. 103.  LAWFUL USE OF ENCRYPTION.

It shall be lawful for any person within any State of the United States,
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any
territory or possession of the United States, to use any encryption,
regardless of the encryption algorithm selected, encryption key length
chosen, or implementation technique  or medium used, except as provided
in this Act or in any other law.  Participation in the key management
infrastructure enabled by this Act is voluntary.

recovery information only to determine the plaintext of any wire or
electronic communication or of any stored electronic information that
the agency lawfully acquires or intercepts, to test cryptographic
products in the agency+s possession, to prove facts in legal
proceedings, or to comply with the request of a duly authorized agency
of a foreign government.  Once such lawful use is completed, the
government agency shall destroy the recovery information in its
possession and shall make a record documenting such destruction.  The
government agency shall not use the recovery information to determine
that plaintext of any wire or electronic communication or of any stored
electronic information unless it has lawful authority to do so apart
from the Act.
