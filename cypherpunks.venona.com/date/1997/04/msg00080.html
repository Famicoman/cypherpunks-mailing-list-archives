&gt; &gt;That's a good idea, but it'll take up a lot of disk space at the

Let them send pictures and warez. A remailer operator shoudn't care. :-)

&gt; &gt;IMO, the 'net has changed from what it used to be a few years ago.
&gt; &gt;One can no longer send e-mail to an unknown recipient and hope that
&gt; &gt;they're willing to accept anonymous e-mail.
&gt; I'd agree, but from the first anonymous remailers open to the public
&gt; there were people who didn't like receiving anonymous mail :-)

Well... Let me quote the complaint that Jim Ray (himself a one-time
remailer operator) sent to postmaster@dm.com because he didn't like
the anonymous messages that he thought might be coming from me:

Say, didn't this Mmmmm... Black Unicorn shmuck threaten to sue me
for saying someone's on lithium?? :-)

&gt; &gt;unless the remailer knows that the recipient took some positive
&gt; &gt;action to indicate that s/he has a clue (such as, added a key to a
&gt; &gt;keyserver), their anon mail should be immediately discarded and
&gt; &gt;they should instead get a note:
&gt;
&gt; That's an interesting approach - a bit extreme, but the main cypherpunks
&gt; applications for anonymous remailers are things like whistleblowing
&gt; (which can be posted to the net or emailed to people like Foo Inspectors
&gt; who _ought_ to be willing to accept anonymous mail) and potential
&gt; co-conspirators (who _ought_ to be willing to accept it if they're
&gt; interested in co-conspiring), and of course yourself under various aliases.

If the maintenance of destination blocking/unblocking is divorced from
the remailer operators, then the whistleblower might be able to find
out whether the recipient accepts anon e-mail. Under the scheme I sort
of proposed, if I wanted to e-mail X, I might look up via the key servers
whether X accepts anon e-mail. If he doesn't, I ping him, knowing that
my ping will be discarded and instead he'll get a form letter telling
him how to enable receipt. I can check (say) the key servers a few days
later and see if he's ready to recieve anon e-mail; then I send the
real message.

Another advantage: there's no need to put the remailer's real address
in the form line.  Right now most operators say something like
"e-mail foo@bar and/or remailer-operators to be dest-blocked".
Under the scheme I'm not quite proposing yet, you can put any
junk in the from: (it's irrelevant!) and put the instructions
for dest-blocking via a 3rd party in a comment header.
