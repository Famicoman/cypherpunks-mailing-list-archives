THE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION ISSUE
     Recently historian Neil Postman warned against the naive belief that
information is "an unmixed blessing, which through its continued and
uncontrolled production and dissemination offers increased freedom, creativity,
and peace of mind" (1992, p. 71*).  Indeed, information and information
technology raise a host of difficult issues:  

     Who will be authorized to have access to the plethora of information that
is generated by computers in the 21st century?

     Will privacy, that most revered of American values, be passe, given the
power of computers and the invasiveness of information bureaucracy and
technology?

     Will the possession of information mean riches for the possessors, and
will those possessors of information inevitably be the rich nations and
neighborhoods of the earth?

     Who will own information, and who will be barred from access to
information?  How will copyright be administered on the Internet?

These are only a few of the myriad of questions and concerns that occur
to practitioners in a variety of professional fields.

 New York, Vintage Books, 1992.
