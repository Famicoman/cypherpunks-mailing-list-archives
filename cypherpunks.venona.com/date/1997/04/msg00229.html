&gt; &gt; terms of that social contract.  If you chose to reject them, then you
&gt; &gt; should leave -- since the individuals who composed that contract were
&gt; &gt; there before you, their rights take priority.
&gt; 
&gt;         BULLSHIT. I don't have a choice. I would like to leave, but
&gt; everywhere is already claimed by fucking statist pricks. There is no
&gt; place left where a person can go and be free of self important pricks
&gt; who think that it is _their_ right to infringe on _my_ rights.

  Since the land thieves have everything locked up, the only option
is to stand and fight.
  Wise conquerers always leave the disenchanted a small, desolate
place they can go to lick their wounds. The current fascists idiots
in power don't have the sense to do that. The result is a civilization
that is falling apart because those who don't want to take it in the
ass have no option except to stick around and fight.

&gt;         If the contract was written by people who no longer exist, and
&gt; enforced from the top, by force then you _do_ have the right to change
&gt; the system from without. Especially since (in the context of American,
&gt; French, and several other "[un]social contracts") they were themselves
&gt; brought about by force and violence, often with the support of less than
&gt; a majority.

  And you can never ignore the 'majority of one'.
  If the government deems it their right to act as they will, as
a result of being heavily armed, then they complain in vain about
the individual deeming it their right to act as they will, as a
result of being heavily armed.
  What is good for the gander (government) is good for the
goose (postal worker).
