While I'm not entirely unsympathetic with the notion that "information
should be free," your statements below are rather incoherent.

For purposes of analysis, let's talk about a story I report and write
myself. Depending on the article and travel involved, I may have spent
hundreds of dollars working on it. I am unwilling to donate those efforts
to the "public domain" every time; I may later want to sell the article to
recoup my costs. Think property rights. (Of course, I admit the need for
broad fair use rights as well.) 

"De facto public domain" is an idea that deserves to die. Now.

&gt; &gt; Subject: Private property rights on cypherpunks
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I forward articles to cypherpunks that are copyrighted by my employers, or
&gt; &gt; magazines like Playboy and Wired for which I write freelance pieces. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I like to think these articles have some value. I will not forward any of
&gt; &gt; them, nor would I be able to, if they magically became "public domain."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "De facto public domain" is an idea that deserves to die. Now.
&gt; 
&gt; Really? Do you have a priori permission from your publisher, who owns those
&gt; stories, to distribute them elsewhere?
&gt; 
&gt; If not please explain why I or any other person should be a willing
&gt; acomplice? You could also still post them anonymously. You could also
&gt; simply include a 'fair use' proviso somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; In such a case it would be in your publishers best interest to require a
&gt; copyright notice. In that case there is no confusion about who owns those
&gt; rights. Especialy when you consider the traffic is global which means your
&gt; 'implied copyright' here don't mean squat there. I suspect just about
&gt; every place that recognizes a copyright recognizes an explicit one.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of "De facto public domain should die" how about,
&gt; 
&gt; "Implied a priori contracts should die now"
&gt; 
&gt; Lord a mighty, haven't you heard? Information wants to be free. Let the
&gt; thing go. If you really think your words are something that will someday win
&gt; a Nobel or make Mr. Bill look like a pauper note it explicitly. However,
&gt; it would seem to me that implicit copyright works against the axiomatic
&gt; crypto-icon.
