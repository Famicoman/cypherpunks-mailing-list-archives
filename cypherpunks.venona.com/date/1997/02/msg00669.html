&gt; Subject: Re: Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer (fwd)
&gt; 
&gt; 	Someone with more experience correct me if I'm wrong (I'm just
&gt; starting to learn about mailing list management), but isn't saving
&gt; at least the first bounce from a given address good in order to check
&gt; what address is the one that's actually bouncing? Admittedly, this only
&gt; applies to badly-formed bounces. The rest can just have the address
&gt; noted.

Hmmm, I can see saving the address causing the bounce in some sort of array
that is indexed to the majordomo subscription list for a given remailer. It
would not cost anything but overhead to save the entire message. I guess my
motivation was not that I cared their mailbox was full or it was a invalid
address but that I wouldn't be able to deliver at this time. I just don't
see any reason that it helps me to know why they can't receive mail only that
they can't.

[re: bi-directional news-mail gateways]
&gt;&gt; &gt;Want to volunteer?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Give me some idea of how much programming knowledge, time, etcetera
&gt;&gt; is required, please, before I can answer. I'd be renting space on some other
&gt;&gt; computer (e.g., an account on cyberpass.net) to do it in; the only higher-level
&gt;&gt; programming language (i.e., beyond Applesoft Basic) that I know anything of
&gt;&gt; is Perl (and I don't know that all that well); and I am somewhat busy with
&gt;&gt; other stuff. In other words, it depends.

&gt;Hmmm, not shure how much programming it would take - never done it myself.
&gt;I think Perl would be an acceptable language. I certainly hope to do the
&gt;majority of the scripts on the CDR in Perl myself. Perhaps there is somebody
&gt;who knows the fine points of how INN cache's messages. Redbeard and I had a
&gt;short discussion about this issue today relating to tracking messages to
&gt;reduce mail-loops. I will discuss it with him and see what happens.

	So far as I can tell, there are two types of news2mail gateways
in common usage: newsgate, which is in C, and the standard LISTSERV
bit.listserv.* gatewaying. I don't know C and don't have that much
reason to learn it (perl makes a lot more sense to me); therefore, I'd
need to locate a perl version or let someone else take care of the
actual programming end of it, with me just handling what the programming
person didn't. Hmm... I wonder if Lance would be available for the
programming? I'd probably be using an account on cyberpass.net for the
gateway in any event.
