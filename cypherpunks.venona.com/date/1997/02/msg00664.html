&gt; Subject: distributed mailing list architecture

&gt; &gt; I'd suggest a simplier solution: to connect each server with a couple,
&gt; &gt; or maybe three, other servers. This scheme is rather robust, does not
&gt; &gt; consume too much CPU time and bandwidth, and is easy to implement.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what the architecture you are suggesting is, but this is
&gt; what I suggest as the simplest to set up.

I envision it to look like a fishnet.

&gt; Have one main majordomo.

There should be no "one main" anything on this project.

&gt; You subscribe to the main majordomo request address, and it forwards
&gt; your subscription request to a random mail-exploder.
&gt; 
&gt; You unsubscribe to the main majordomo request address, and it forwards
&gt; your subscription to all the mail-exploders request addresses
&gt; (unsubscribe traffic is low anyway, keeping track of who is subscribed
&gt; where at the main major domo doesn't seem worth it).
&gt; 
&gt; Each person who wishes to run an exploder is subscribed (manually) to
&gt; the main majordomo.
&gt; 
&gt; You submit articles to the main majordomo, and it sends copies of the
&gt; articles to it's subscribers (the mail-exploders).
&gt; 
&gt; The mail-exploders send mail to the address on their subscriber lists.
&gt; 
&gt; (John Gilmore suggested this architecture, as a simpler alternative).

Simpler? Hardly.

With the remailer chain proposal we could have a working remailer network
up in a couple of more days. What you propose will take weeks to write
and debug code and then follow it through.

No, this approach is neither simple or efficient.

What I call a fishnet toplogy is much cleaner. Each node only has to
filter messages where it was in the source chain. Easy to do with procmail,
if you look at the first example on the man page, eg how to dump to
dev/null, you find a perfect example of what procmail needs to do. It does
not need to know who else is on the network (as in a star) and its traffic
consists of one copy of each incoming instead of n copies from each of
the 'star' remailers plus the outgoing from the local subscribers. A easy
protocol can be arranged so that if the downstream remailer breaks it
subscribes to the next one in the chain, again easy to do with just a few
lines of code...


  If (bounce count of next site expires)
    {
       subscribe backup feed
    }
  If (next site returns)
    {
       unsubscribe backup feed
    }



As to the actual architecture:


                      A --&gt; D
                     ^ \   ^ \
                    /   v /   v
                   C &lt;-- B &lt;-- E
                         ^
                         |
                         v
                         N  (mail-news gateway)


Again, several nice features are:

  *  Can be gotten up from a stock majordom/procmail install in a
     trivial manner

  *  Site only has to filter mail from itself

  *  It only has to keep up with two sites in the network instead
     of many (support for limited scope and anonymity)

  *  Each site gets a critical feed from only 1 other site so traffic of
     duplicates is a minimum

  *  Except for sites on the boundary of the net every site has two
     places to send its output, adding to robustness, if we allow
     the edges to wrap (eg torus) then no sites have less than 2
     other sites to send traffic to.

  *  Supports various levels of encryption or authentication on a link
     by link basis, not forcing all members to submint to a general
     architecture

  *  Scales easily, something the star model does not do since hub
     machines must grow at a rate dependant on the total number of
     remailers in the chain this equates to mullah and lots of it
     should the network take off

  *  The actual number of machines in a given chain is flexible, I
     would guess the number should match a plane tiling figure,
     triangle (n=3), squares (n=4), or hexagons (n=6)

  *  Traffic analysis and sync floods are harder to impliment in this
     architecture than a star or hub based network

  *  Supports 'little' machines and operators who are not guru's
     or have deep pockets
