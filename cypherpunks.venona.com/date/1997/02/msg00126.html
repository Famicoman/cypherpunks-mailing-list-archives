i do have unix (linux) and stuff, but i can't take a lot of subscribers
-- maybe 200-300 or so.

i actually wrote a proposal for a mailing list without a central control
point, with several advantages being impossibility of control, absense
of a single point of failure, and cryptographic verification of honesty 
of moderators.

if there is any interest, i will post it here.

&gt; I was amused by the similarities of USG crypto policy and the
&gt; moderation of the cypherpunks list.  Recently a number of new
&gt; regulations were announced to go into effect by a certain date.
&gt; Requests for comments were made after the policy was announced.  Many
&gt; of us thought that was pretty sneaky.  I feel the same way about the
&gt; moderation plan.
&gt; 
&gt; Moderation has been a failure.  I'm pretty good at filtering and I
&gt; can sadly report that there is very little signal out there.
&gt; 
&gt; There are lessons to be learned here.  One is that censorship does
&gt; not promote a stimulating and creative dialogue.  The cypherpunks list
&gt; right now is about as interesting as hanging out by the 7-11.
&gt; 
&gt; Another lesson is the danger of choke points.  We can see how
&gt; tempting it is for people to exercise their control.  Even John Gilmore
&gt; was unable to restrain himself from involuntary social engineering
&gt; experiments.  Who would we have considered to be more trustworthy?
&gt; 
&gt; Toad.com is a choke point, not just in terms of moderation but in
&gt; terms of the rate at which it can distribute messages.  Let's
&gt; replace it.
&gt; 
&gt; What we want are many machines carrying the cypherpunks list.  A
&gt; message posted to any machine goes to all of the others.  Each
&gt; machine sends messages to its subscribers only once.  Some of
&gt; these machines should be across borders.
&gt; 
&gt; The mail loop and multiple posting problems are solved by observing
&gt; the message IDs.
&gt; 
&gt; Fast implementation: use moderated mailing list software.  Put a
&gt; filter in the .forward file of the "moderator" account which looks
&gt; at the message ID and forwards the message if it hasn't been seen
&gt; already.  The mailing list machines all subscribe each other.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been looking for a stable machine with a good net connection to
&gt; do this.  I haven't found one.  However, if we have many machines
&gt; sharing the load, the stability of any one unit is not as important
&gt; because the list will survive multiple "hits".  Only the subscribers
&gt; on one machine will be affected by having their messages delayed.
&gt; This greatly reduces the work and responsibility for any one list
&gt; operator.  (As John will attest, keeping a machine running 24 hours a
&gt; day, 7 days a week, rain or shine, is a lot of work.)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, with multiple machines, each unit handles a small amount of the
&gt; load.  This makes more machines available and has less impact on
&gt; people's net connections.
&gt; 
&gt; Last I checked, there were about 1200 addresses on the mailing list at
&gt; toad.com.  All we need are about 10 machines to take 120 subscribers
&gt; each.  (This is a completely manageable load.)
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a Unix machine on the Net?  Does it have sendmail and
&gt; Perl?  Then you have all that it takes to participate.  Send me
&gt; mail and I'll help you set it up.

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I like and respect John and Sandy and I've learned a lot from
&gt; both of them.  While basically well-intentioned, they just made a
&gt; mistake in this instance.
&gt;
