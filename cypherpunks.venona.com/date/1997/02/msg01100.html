NEW "Black Box" Technology !!

GET IN ON THE TOP LEVEL of the Hottest New Program


 
1. GLOBAL COM TECHNOLOGY -GCT- is the name 
of the new company created to handle the basket of telecom-
munications breakthrough technologies we're going to 
represent.  It  is based  in Chesapeake, VA.  GCT has been 
put together by a highly seasoned group including MAJOR 
individuals in the Telecom industry. They have selected 
Kerry J. Young, a skilled executive and administrator, to be 
President and CEO.  They have also assembled a blue ribbon 
support team headed by a top level executive from one of the 
"big three" telephone companies.  This combined powerhouse 
of high-level Telecom experience, management, administration, 
marketing and financial depth promises to  make GCT one of 
the world's premier telecommunications companies.

Their mission: To create the world's largest MLM network to 
deliver advanced Telecom technology at the most competitive 
price.  In short, they plan on delivering products that will stand 
the industry on its ear!

2. GCT has set up a 24-hour information line: 415-273-6121.  
Call it NOW!  It is powerful.  It will introduce several of the 
key players and answer questions about the products, how 
they work and how our business will be structured.

3. The company has announced the official launch date: Monday, 
March 3, 1997. On Saturday, the 15th of March, GCT will be 
holding simultaneous training's/meetings in eight cities across the 
United States.  The locations are: Atlanta + Chicago + Dallas + 
Honolulu + Los Angeles + Orlando + Seattle + Washington, DC.   
The company will add additional cities as you indicate your 
preference.  Seating is extremely limited and must be reserved in 
advance by calling an 800# which will be made available within 
a few days on the GCT hotline.  Price: $59 - includes Distributor 
Kit!

4. What will we be offering?  We will have a FULL RANGE 
of products -- with far more advanced technology and far better 
pricing than is currently being offered by the several, hastily 
launched GCT wannabees.  The first products announced 
include a prepaid calling card at 9.9 cents per minute, long 
distance service at 7.9 cents and WE HAVE the long awaited 
"black box" technology! It comes in three versions (from basic 
to advanced) and will wholesale: $39 - $69.  In addition, there 
are several more advanced products which will be brought into 
our portfolio.  As more information becomes available, it is 
increasingly clear: We are poised to bring the world what 
everyone has been promised  -- but ONLY WE CAN DELIVER!

6. Beware of other companies who have attempted to preempt 
GCT by implying they can duplicate the various products that 
we already have on board.  This program is not merely an 
application form and compensation plan offering a single, 
7.9 cent product.  GCT is a major new Telecom company 
assembling a full range of leading edge telecommunications 
technology.   The success of this program requires the contacts 
and know-how of the Telecom industry that can only come from 
years of experience at the highest levels.  Bringing these 
exceptional products to market is not a project for well-meaning 
amateurs.  

7. The only way to participate in the program described 
above is to join GCT. They are the ONLY COMPANY with 
the contracts in hand, technical skill and telecommunications 
experience to deliver.  Global Connections is a group of very 
experienced marketers and networkers who have an Independent 
Distributorship positioned directly at the top level of GCT.

8. We are signing up the frontline on Monday &amp; Tuesday...  I can place you on the top levels...
