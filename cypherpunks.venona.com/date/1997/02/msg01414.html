&gt; &gt;&gt;        Was anyone else besides me amazed by the guy
&gt; &gt;&gt;from Deloitte-Touche at the Internet Privacy Coalition luncheon
&gt; &gt;&gt;last week? I mean, he all but advocated violent overthrow of
&gt; &gt;&gt;the government. [...]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For the benefit of those of us who were not at this luncheon (probably
&gt; &gt;not even in the same country), could you please say more about this,
&gt; &gt;Marshall?  What was the subject?  What _did_ the DT speaker say, exactly?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; After a while, I stopped taking notes, because I was so astounded at
&gt; what he was saying.
&gt; (Maybe someone with more complete notes could post a better summary)
&gt; 
&gt; But, here a brief overview of the luncheon:
&gt; 
&gt; Last Wednesday, January 29th, the Internet Privacy Coalition had
&gt; a "policy lunch" in San Francisco. It was in one of the hotels hosting
&gt; the RSA conference, and at the same time that the conference was
&gt; breaking for lunch, so it was easy for attendees to "switch lunches".
&gt; 
&gt; The speakers (as I remember, apologies to any I miss) were:
&gt; 	Whit Diffie
&gt; 	John Gilmore
&gt; 	Kenneth Bass (counsel in Karn vs. Dept of State)
&gt; 	Herb Lin (who ran the NRC staff for the crypto study)
&gt; 	Marc Rotenberg
&gt; 	William Hugh Murray (Deloitte &amp; Touche)
&gt; 	and a couple others that I missed, as I left early.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Murray gave a long, impassioned speech.
&gt; 
&gt; He said that the government is going to crack down on
&gt; domestic possession and use of crypto, that they
&gt; were looking to increase their wiretapping capabilities
&gt; 100-fold, and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; He was very emphatic about not trusting anything
&gt; that the government says, and that once they got
&gt; their "foot in the door", that they would seek to
&gt; expand their abilities to regulate, etc, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; He advocated deployment of strong crypto. He
&gt; insisted that there was no way the government
&gt; could stop the export of strong crypto. He exhorted
&gt; people to refuse to obey the ITAR/EAR regulations,
&gt; and to lobby their congresscritters to get the
&gt; PRO-CODE bill passed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It wasn't really what he said that amazed me, because
&gt; I had heard most of it (in bits and pieces) before. It
&gt; was presenting it all in a package, in an emotional
&gt; manner, by an elderly, conseratively dressed
&gt; accountant who was representing a large
&gt; corporation whose job it is to help people obey the
&gt; government.
&gt; 
&gt; [ My father was an accountant. He worked for
&gt; Deloitte-Touche, in fact. I don't expect accountants
&gt; to be passionate about government regs, and
&gt; especially not to advocate disobediance. Maybe
&gt; that's why this affected me so strongly. ]

&gt; 

I think Bill Murray might take offense at being called an accountant.
