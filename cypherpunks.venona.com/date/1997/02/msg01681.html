    Thank you for writing to President Clinton via electronic
mail.  Since June, 1993, whitehouse.gov has received over one
million messages from people across the country and around the
world.  

    Because so many of you write, the President cannot
personally review each message.  The mail is first read by White
House Correspondence staff.  Your concerns, ideas, and
suggestions are carefully recorded and communicated to the
President weekly with a representative sampling of the mail.

     We are excited about the progress of online communication as
a tool to bring government and the people closer together.  Your
continued interest and participation are very important to that
goal.

                       Sincerely,

                       Stephen K. Horn
                       Director, Presidential Email
                       The Office of Correspondence

P.S. Please read on - you may find the following information
useful.

--  This is the only electronic message you will receive from
whitehouse.gov.  No other message purporting to be from the
President or his staff with an address at whitehouse.gov is
authentic.  If you have received such a message, you have been
spoofed.

--  You will receive only one autoresponder message per day.

--  The only personal addresses at whitehouse.gov are the
following:

    President@whitehouse.gov
    Vice.President@whitehouse.gov
    First.Lady@whitehouse.gov

Please write to Mrs. Gore and other White House staff by regular
mail.  The address is:  

     The White House, Washington, D.C. 20500.

--   On October 20, 1994, President Clinton and Vice President
Gore opened a World Wide Web home page called "Welcome to the
White House:  An Interactive Citizens' Handbook" and it remains
one of the more popular spots on the Web.  The White House
home page provides, among other things,  a single point of access
to all government information available electronically on the
Internet.  "Welcome to the White House" can be accessed at:

               <A  HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov</A>

--   White House documents and publications are available on the
World Wide Web (see above) and by email.  To receive instructions
on retrieving documents by email, please send a message to the
following address:

               publications@whitehouse.gov

In the body of your message, type "Send Info" (without quotes);
do not include other text (such as message headers or
signature lines (.sig files)).  The instructions will be sent to
you automatically.

Questions) document is available at the following address.  The
FAQ, among other things, lists alternate sources of government
information, i.e., the Congressional email projects.  Send an

&gt; &gt; Ok...this is the fourth junk e-mail I've received that I don't want. 
Your
&gt; &gt; account is in jeapordy, and my advice is for you to just stop sending
me
&gt; &gt; this junk.  Take me off your e-mail list, NOW.
&gt; &gt; If this e-mail from me, being mad at you, is what makes you happy, and
is
&gt; &gt; how you have fun, then you just have a personal problem and I feel
sorry
&gt; &gt; for you.
&gt; &gt; Do what you can to heal yourself...meanwhile, don't send me
anymore...your
&gt; &gt; isp provider is next on my e-mail list.
&gt; 
&gt; Jerry, my provider is GTE, and if you think you can make a dent in
&gt; them, go ahead and butt your head against the wall.  No sweat offa
&gt; my ass.
&gt; 
&gt; OTOH, if you stop bitching and groaning long enough to figure out
&gt; who is doing the remailing etc., then you'll be miles ahead.  I'm
&gt; not optimistic.
