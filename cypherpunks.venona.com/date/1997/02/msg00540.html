If the people decide for creation of a new USENET newsgroup,
we need to think very hard about actually moving it to a different
hierarchy from alt.*. I would propose comp.org.cypherpunks,
comp.cypherpunks, sci.crypt.cypherpunks or something like that.

A comp.* or sci.* newsgroup, if created, has the following advantages
over an alt.* newsgroup:

1) There is usually less spam in sci.* or comp.*
2) There are virtually no completely irrelevant flamewars
3) The propagation will be a lot better
4) More people will be able to read it because of the issue of providers
   not carrying alt.*.

I see nothing that would make a sci.* or comp.* newsgroup  worse than
alt.* newsgroup.

&gt; 
&gt; I talked to Hugh Daniel at the Saturday meeting about the creation of an
&gt; "alt.cypherpunks" unmoderated (of course) newsgroup as a possible
&gt; alternative (or supplement) to cypherpunks@toad.com. Greg Broiles and John
&gt; Gilmore were there for part of the discussion, too.
&gt; 
&gt; (We did not, unfortunately, get to the "future of the list" topic at the
&gt; physical meeting...the excellent presentations ran way over the expected
&gt; time and we never got to this topic. Sort of too bad, given John's edict
&gt; that we have 10 days to find and implement an alternative....)
&gt; 
&gt; A Usenet newsgroup has many advantages and disadvantages. Whether it might
&gt; be gatewayed to other mailing lists--perhaps even the list(s) which
&gt; survives "cypherpunks@toad.com"--depends of course on the decision of those
&gt; hosting others lists.
&gt; 
&gt; A charter statement is needed, and then the issuance of a creation message.
&gt; A better charter statement will increase the chances of more sites carrying
&gt; the newsgroup. While many sites carry essentially all newsgroups--more than
&gt; 30,000--, some sites do not and only carry some of the alt.heirarchy. And
&gt; some sites do not carry _any_ of the alt newsgroups.
&gt; 
&gt; At Hugh's suggestion, I'm suggesting a "first cut" at a charter statement.
&gt; Suggestions for additional language or changes are welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Charter for alt.cypherpunks: (suggested)
&gt; 
&gt; "Alt.cypherpunks is for the unmoderated discussion of cryptography and the
&gt; political, social, and economic implications of unrestricted, strong
&gt; cryptography. The Cypherpunks grpup has existed since 1992 and has been
&gt; central in the debate about strong crypto, government restrictions, crypto
&gt; anarchy, and in showing weaknesses of various ciphers and security
&gt; products. The mailing list has had as many as 1500 subscribers, plus
&gt; gateways to newsgroups and Web sites. It is expected that "alt.cypherpunks"
&gt; will be a free-wheeling forum for many viewpoints. As it is unmoderated,
&gt; readers are strongly advised to learn how to use filters and other tools
&gt; for making virtual anarchies manageable for their own tastes."
&gt; 
&gt; I invite your comments, editorial suggestions, etc. Perhaps when enough of
&gt; the "collective mind" has made inputs (ughh!), the charter can be submitted
&gt; with the creation message. (I'm not knowledgeable about the process, but
&gt; I'll bet many of you are.)
&gt; 
&gt; There are of course disadvantages to such a newsgroup, as any Usenet user
&gt; certainly knows. However, there are advantages as well. Here are some of
&gt; each:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; * Advantages:
&gt; 
&gt; - Usenet is set up to automagically propagate articles across tens of
&gt; thousands of sites.
&gt; 
&gt; - there is no "nexus" of control, no chokepoint, no precedent (in the U.S.)
&gt; for halting distribution of Usenet newsgroups. (Canada stopped some
&gt; Homulka-Teale newsgroups a few years ago, other countries have blocked
&gt; entire sections, but note that the Scientologists have been unable to block
&gt; "alt.religion.scientology"...I surmise that a mailing list version of
&gt; a.r.s. would have faced lawsuits against the list.owner, if reachable in
&gt; U.S. or European courts...a lesson to think about with the current
&gt; imbroglio over certain claims about certain products and the possible
&gt; liability of Sandy and/or toad.com.)
&gt; 
&gt; - fairly sophisticated newsreading software already exists.
&gt; 
&gt; - no "unsuscribe" and "unscrive" messages! (It makes it easy for newcomers
&gt; to discover the group, read it for a while, then stop. It also, of course,
&gt; increases the number of "What is crypto?" sorts of messages.)
&gt; 
&gt; - persons cannot be unsubscribed from an unmoderated list
&gt; 
&gt; - with a Usenet group, there is no ability to impose notions of "order" on
&gt; the list (e.g., requirements for PGP-signing, demands for "on-topic" posts,
&gt; removal of "illegal" posts, etc.). Thus, people must deal with a virtual
&gt; anarchy by using proper tools, by ignoring what they don't want to see, or
&gt; by contracting out the role of "nanny" to others.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; * Disadvantages
&gt; 
&gt; - Usenet newsgroups are easy targets for spammers, even more so than are
&gt; mailing lists.
&gt; 
&gt; - crossposting often gets out of hand. (With 30,000+ newsgroups, even
&gt; well-intentioned posters often pick the "three or four most likely" targets
&gt; for their posts).
&gt; 
&gt; - propagation is often spotty, and some sites have no access at all to the
&gt; "alt.*" hierarchy. (Many corporate sites block the alt heirarchy. Many
&gt; academic sites block just the alt.binaries.pictures heirarchy. Etc. A news
&gt; to mailing list gateway is possible for these readers.)
&gt; 
&gt; - propagation may be slower than mailing lists.
&gt; 
&gt; - Usenet is of course archived and easily searchable via Alta Vista, Deja
&gt; News, etc.. This bothers some people. (However, the CP mailing list is now
&gt; also archived and searchable, so the disadvantage is becoming moot.)
&gt; 
&gt; - persons cannot be unsubscribed from an unmoderated list (this is also an
&gt; advantage, of course)
&gt; 
&gt; - there will be more newbie-type messages, as casual browsers of Usenet
&gt; discover alt.cypherpunks and ask questions. This is both a disadvantage and
&gt; an advantage.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; * Discussion of some of these points:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The issue of slow- or non-propagation can be handled by having mailing
&gt; lists which bounce the traffic (from a well-connected site) to folks who
&gt; get slow distribution, or no distribution at all. News to mail gateways, in
&gt; other words. Traffic in the reverse direction (end reader back to
&gt; alt.cypherpunks) can be handled either by "blind posting" to the a.c.
&gt; newsgroup, via one's newsreader, or through mail-to-news gateways, or
&gt; perhaps via the distributor described here.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. And the services of "moderators," such as Eric Blossom's and Ray
&gt; Arachelian's "best of" lists, or even Sandy's list, are of course still
&gt; possible. A newsgroup does not change this, except for the latency in
&gt; getting messages out to newsgroup sites.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The advantages of a "no nexus, no chokepoint" distribution are huge. The
&gt; Usenet carries huge advantages in terms of having no place to attack it.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Some have raised the point that Usenet is "inefficient" and should not
&gt; be used for this reason. Well, it may indeed be ineficient, but the costs
&gt; have already been incurred, and alt.cypherpunks would only be 1/30,000th of
&gt; additional load (very roughly speaking). In other words, might as well use
&gt; what's out there. If a "second Usenet" ever comes into existence, fine.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Some of us discussed the creation of alt.cypherpunks back in '92-93. At
&gt; that time, we thought the mailing list had some major advantages. In my
&gt; view, the situation has changed dramatically since then. The mailing list
&gt; has become huge, the volume of noise has increased, majordomo is allowing
&gt; the list to be used for spamming (any 'bot system will probably have this),
&gt; and the list is already gatewayed to many sites as a _newsgroup_ anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I think the time has come to just create it. The "activation energy
&gt; barrier" of a mailing list, where people would have to make the effort to
&gt; subscribe, has long since become irrelevant.
&gt; 
&gt; It may be a target for spammers, but it's hard to imagine it being much
&gt; worse than what we have now.
&gt; 
&gt; Usenet is an anarchy. We might as well use it.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never created an alt group, but I presume many of you have (and I know
&gt; of one currently fed up Cypherpunk who created the entire alt.* hierarchy a
&gt; decade or so ago). I presume some of you can thus help in such an effort.

&gt; Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
&gt; We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
