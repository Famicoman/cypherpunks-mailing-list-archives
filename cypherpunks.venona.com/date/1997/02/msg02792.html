<PRE>
I am under the assumption that alt.cypherpunks or
alt.privacy.cypherpunks or some such will come into existence shortly.

With that in mind, I have decided to create a FAQ of pointers to
resources on cypherpunk issues.  The goal is to help eliminate the
"What is PGP?" and other newbie-questions that are bound to come up
even more frequently in a newsgroup scenario.

A FAQ such as this has probably long been appropriate, but it didn't
really occur to me until just now.  Not being a cryptologist or
adequate coder, this is one way I feel I can contribute.  It's hard to
have discussions when people haven't even looked at the background
information before piping in.  I don't pretend that a FAQ can prevent
this, but it's worth a shot anyway.

I started typing away about two hours ago and came up with the
following.  It's pretty shaky since it's late and it's Mardi Gras.
Feel free to comment in public or private.  Please, Please, Please
make suggestions and provide relevant pointers.  Obviously, I will be
doing a lot of research over the next few weeks to fill in this very
bare outline.

If you disagree with this or feel its useless... fine.  Please tell me
and explain all your reasons why.  Besides, I'm doing it regardless.

Here's what I'm chewing on so far....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			Cypherpunks Resources FAQ
			     version 0.000000001

This document lists resources for readers interested in Cypherpunk
issues and goals.   

The primary intention of this document is to get new readers to the
group to explore the background issues which cypherpunks attempt to
address.  It also includes pointers to many common cryptographic
implementations and tools.  Furthermore, pointers and instructions for
various mailreaders are provided to help users filter out some of
Usenet's inevitable noise and glean the most useful information they
can from this newsgroup.

This FAQ does not attempt to explictly define who the Cypherpunks are
or answer questions about the philosophy.  That is an exercise for the
reader who utilizes the pointers within to find the answers on their
own.  After exploring these resources, the hope is that the reader
will become a more effective and insightful contributor to
alt.cypherpunks -- even if he/she is opposed to the goals of the
group.

This FAQ is propagated monthly to alt.cypherpunks.  It can also be
obtained be sending email with the subject and/or body "get cpunks
faq" to omegam@cmq.com.  When information in the FAQ is updated, I
will also post a "what's new" message for those who are interested in
reading additions/corrections without wading throught the entire FAQ
again.


-------*********------- Author's Note/Disclaimer ---------*********--------- 

I maintain this FAQ solely on a voluntary basis.  I am doing this
because I think it is necessary.

It would be contrary to the anarchic nature of the Cypherpunks to
attempt to call this an official FAQ of the Cypherpunks group.  Anyone
who disagrees with the editing decisions and pointer selections I have
made in this FAQ is free to.

What this means is that you are encouraged to send comments,
suggestions, corrections, new questions, and answers to me.  I may or
may not include them in future revisions of the FAQ.  I do ask that
somewhere in the subject of your mail redarding this FAQ you include
the text "(CFAQ suggest)", so procmail can file such comments
appropriately and I can address them in a more efficient manner.  If I
use your suggestion or answer to a question, I will attribute the
reference to you unless you request that I do not.

You are free to create your own Cypherpunks-resources FAQ if you don't
like mine.
