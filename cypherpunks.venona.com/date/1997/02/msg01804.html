&gt; 
&gt; I talked to Hugh Daniel at the Saturday meeting about the creation of an
&gt; "alt.cypherpunks" unmoderated (of course) newsgroup as a possible
&gt; alternative (or supplement) to cypherpunks@toad.com. Greg Broiles and John
&gt; Gilmore were there for part of the discussion, too.
&gt; 
&gt; (We did not, unfortunately, get to the "future of the list" topic at the
&gt; physical meeting...the excellent presentations ran way over the expected
&gt; time and we never got to this topic. Sort of too bad, given John's edict
&gt; that we have 10 days to find and implement an alternative....)

I was wondering how this part of the discussion would go, oh well.

&gt; At Hugh's suggestion, I'm suggesting a "first cut" at a charter statement.
&gt; Suggestions for additional language or changes are welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Charter for alt.cypherpunks: (suggested)
&gt; 
&gt; "Alt.cypherpunks is for the unmoderated discussion of cryptography and the
&gt; political, social, and economic implications of unrestricted, strong
&gt; cryptography. The Cypherpunks grpup has existed since 1992 and has been
&gt; central in the debate about strong crypto, government restrictions, crypto
&gt; anarchy, and in showing weaknesses of various ciphers and security
&gt; products. The mailing list has had as many as 1500 subscribers, plus
&gt; gateways to newsgroups and Web sites. It is expected that "alt.cypherpunks"
&gt; will be a free-wheeling forum for many viewpoints. As it is unmoderated,
&gt; readers are strongly advised to learn how to use filters and other tools
&gt; for making virtual anarchies manageable for their own tastes."

Sounds good enough to me.

&gt; I invite your comments, editorial suggestions, etc. Perhaps when enough of
&gt; the "collective mind" has made inputs (ughh!), the charter can be submitted
&gt; with the creation message. (I'm not knowledgeable about the process, but
&gt; I'll bet many of you are.)

I get the impression that Greg Broiles is, and he posted a message
proposing the creation of alt.cypherpunks a few hours before yours.
Perhaps you had not seen it.  Anyway he didn't propose a charter.


As Sten Drescher &lt;stend@sten.tivoli.com&gt; and Jim Choate
&lt;ravage@einstein.ssz.com&gt; just announced their work on a distributed
list based on multiple majordomo hosts, the question remains as to
which of:

1. separate alt.cypherpunks and cypherpunks list 

2. alt.cypherpunks and cypherpunks list gated both ways

3. cypherpunks list only

are most useful.

Either option 1 or option 2 sound good to me.  If the gating takes
place at a site with a good news feed, this would provide a mechanism
to allow people to access the list either way they chose.  (An
implementation of the news-mail / mail-news you proposed).
