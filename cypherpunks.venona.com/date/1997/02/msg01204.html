&gt;I believe homophobia is a great way to bring out the censors in
&gt;people.  However, inducing censorship is only part of fighting it.
&gt;You also need respectable people to some in, argue cogently against
&gt;the dangers of censorship, perhaps even get some extremely reasonable
&gt;articles suppressed, and then spread the word about it.  I find the
&gt;freedom-knights tactics' extremely lacking in this second, "clean up
&gt;and analyze the mess" phase.
&gt; 

  Yes but the process is a very long term one--you seemed focused
on this specific instance.  I'm especially interested in the demise
of plug pulling sys admins for example--they should be hung by their
balls from the highest pole--the kind of net.slime EFF protects.  As
for analysis and cleanup that's a bit easier to contain on a list
as opposed to the usenet at large.

&gt;As a recent example illustrates well, Vulis did a nice job of inducing
&gt;censorship on cypherpunks.  However, I think most peoples' opinions
&gt;didn't really turn, or at least people didn't realize how serious
&gt;things were and didn't really care, until Tim May [someone the many
&gt;freedom-knights hate] started criticizing this censorship in extremely
&gt;reasonable messages that were suppressed from both the -edited and
&gt;-flames mailing list.

  And for that to happen vivid examples of such censorship had to 
occur and a snake was exposed as being a snake.  Seems like it worked
extremely well to me.  It also appears that the cleanup you rightly
refer to is happening as a natural progression--same will be true
hopefully on a broader scale on usenet when others personally get
a taste of the censorship that is lurking behind every corner.  
And for those who jumped on the bandwagon because Mr. May was
being censored as oppossed to Dr. Vulis--they are sad people indeed.
