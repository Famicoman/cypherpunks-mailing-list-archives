Ok...this is the fourth junk e-mail I've received that I don't want.  Your
account is in jeapordy, and my advice is for you to just stop sending me
this junk.  Take me off your e-mail list, NOW.  
If this e-mail from me, being mad at you, is what makes you happy, and is
how you have fun, then you just have a personal problem and I feel sorry
for you.  
Do what you can to heal yourself...meanwhile, don't send me anymore...your
isp provider is next on my e-mail list.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Before I explain what has happened, I want to make one thing
&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely clear.  Though I've thought the moderation of cypherpunks
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a terrible idea from the start and am even more convinced of it
&gt; &gt; &gt; now, I don't assign any blame to Sandy.  I believe he offered to
&gt; &gt; &gt; moderate the list with the best of intentions, and I sincerely
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate his efforts to try to revive what was once a fantastic
&gt; &gt; &gt; mailing list, even if in my opinion those efforts have backfired.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the fatal mistake, assuming it's really a mistake.
&gt; I've worked under several corporations where, at a certain
&gt; point in time, things just "went crazy", and the owners/
&gt; managers were scrambling desperately to plug as many holes
&gt; in the dike as they possibly could, to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; People don't understand why things just "go crazy" at a particular
&gt; point, and so they accept the coincidence theory ruse, lacking any
&gt; other evidence.  Use your head, folks.  This is not a list made up
&gt; of sewing-circle nannies, these are security people, NSA, CIA, and
&gt; all the ugly things you shut out of your conversations because you
&gt; don't want to admit the truth.  "Paranoia is a way of knowing".
&gt; 
&gt; Today I saw an old picture of Albert Einstein in full Indian regalia,
&gt; smoking a peace pipe with some Hopi people.  I thought of the Capone
&gt; mob and the "kiss of death", or Judas and Jesus, you get the picture.
&gt; 
&gt; So Einstein puts his name and reputation and personal seal of approval
&gt; on the creation of the Doomsday Device, the atom bomb, knowing full
&gt; well that it will be used to murder millions of people. What does he
&gt; do for an encore?  Plants the "kiss of death" on the Hopis, whose
&gt; environment is co-opted by the mad bombers and their Nazi-infested
&gt; thug "scientist" cohorts, for the experimentation and storage of
&gt; nuclear and other hazardous materials.  You know, Nevada, Arizona,
&gt; New Mexico, all those "useless, desert lands" occupied by the
&gt; Indians.
