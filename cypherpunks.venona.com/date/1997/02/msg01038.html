Subj: ESSAY: [2/2] Natanyahu

&gt;

&gt;The Secret Life Of Binyamin Netanyahu

&gt;

&gt;Even within the conventional story, it is clear that Netanyahu was

&gt;groomed for leadership by the Council On Foreign Relations (CFR) in New

&gt;York. In 1979, twenty-seven year old Netanyahu called a conference on

&gt;terrorism and the ruling elite of the CFR, Bush, Shultz and Perle

&gt;answered to his summons. One word will suffice: why?

&gt;

&gt;Yoni Netanyahu was undoubtedly a martyr but far from the only one in

&gt;Israel. He was not such a powerful symbol that the CFR would send a

&gt;delegation of its biggest guns, including CIA director Bush to his

&gt;unknown brother's get-together.

&gt;

&gt;Netanyahu's decision to quit his lucrative Boston job is almost

&gt;inexplcable. Netanyahu sought a highpaying job at a prestigious

&gt;consulting firm yet not two months later, he gave it up to fly back to

&gt;Israel and sell sofas. He was barely settled in back home when he

&gt;decided to organize an anti-terrorism conference and invite the most

&gt;powerful people in Washington to attend.

&gt;

&gt;It is possible that Netanyahu was told to quit his job, return to

&gt;Israel and arrange the conference. Perhaps there is a connection to the

&gt;fact that a year later Shultz later made fighting terrorism a first

&gt;priority of the Reagan administration and that Vice-President Bush was

&gt;appointed to head a front for illegal covert activities called The

&gt;Anti-Terror Task Force.

&gt;

&gt;Arens' offer of a deputy ambassadorship to salesman Netanyahu

&gt;made no political sense. Israeli diplomatic aides and deputies

&gt;typically rise slowly through the Foreign Ministry bureaucracy. They

&gt;are not thrust into the second highest position at the most vital

&gt;embassy in the world. It is far from impossible that Arens was

&gt;directed to bring in Netanyahu by the very people in the Reagan

&gt;administration who attended his conference three years earlier.

&gt;

&gt;Once in New York in 1984, CFR-affiliated media such as CNN, the New

&gt;York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek and CFR members Koppel and King

&gt;turned Netanyahu into a major political figure; so much so that George

&gt;Shultz became a close friend. We again ask the succinct question: why?

&gt;What did Shultz, twenty years Netanyahu's senior, find so amusing about

&gt;the Israeli UN Ambassador that he had to pay him a courtesy call every

&gt;time he flew to New York? In 1985, Shultz chaired another Netanyahu-

&gt;organized conference on terrorism, this time in Washington. The

&gt;resulting publicity and prestige was a significant factor in

&gt;Netanyahu's fast-rising political career. Clearly, the secretary-of-

&gt;state had a major stake in Netanyahu's future. Which means, so did

&gt;George Bush.

&gt;

&gt;All that can be concluded from the conventional story. What then do we

&gt;make of Bibi's secret life?

&gt;

&gt;In 1987, Netanyahu applied for credit using his American social

&gt;security number 020364537. With that number, he or someone else made

&gt;the application under a phony name, John Sullivan, living at a false

&gt;address in Northern California.

&gt;

&gt;Netanyahu used Sullivan's name to borrow money during 1987-88. John

&gt;Sullivan does not exist, nor does Netanyahu's credit file. Israeli and

&gt;American reporters who tried to dig into Netanyahu's past using his

&gt;social security number discovered two other phony names used to apply

&gt;for credit in 1987-88 but were perplexed to find that his credit

&gt;records were completely removed. Only someone very high up in the

&gt;American government could have authorized the erasing of the file.

&gt;

&gt;We return to the all-purpose question: why? Again, no one who knows is

&gt;talking. What is nearly certain is that while Netanyahu was the UN

&gt;Ambassador, he was either defrauding a credit company or on an

&gt;assignment involving money that required three identity changes.

&gt;

&gt;Then there is Netanyahu's close relationship with Congressman Ben

&gt;Gillman, head of the House Committee On International Relations. The

&gt;problem here is that Gillman was also a close associate of Shabtai

&gt;Kalmonovitch and shared business deals with him in Africa. Kalmonovitch

&gt;was, not long after, imprisoned in Israel as a KGB spy. This is not to

&gt;imply that Netanyahu was involved in spying, only that his closest ally

&gt;in Congress has mighty strange intelligence ties to Israel.

&gt;

&gt;And what to make of the mystery of Netanyahu's housing?. Before he was

&gt;even the leader of the Likud, two foreign businessmen, Jack Mandel of

&gt;Australia and Sandy Eisenstadt of the US each paid about $750,000 to

&gt;buy Netanyahu luxury apartments in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Again, no

&gt;one has a clue why. There is speculation that part of the reason may be

&gt;Eisenstadt's stake in an Israeli oil exploration company, a shady and

&gt;hidden business, but no concrete connection has been discovered by the

&gt;Israeli media.

&gt;

&gt;Netanyahu's penchant for secrecy is not subtle. It is well-known among

&gt;the Israeli media that he had conducted a number of secret meetings

&gt;with the Jordanian royal family in London and Amman before he became

&gt;prime minister. Even the conventional Jerusalem Post reported in mid-

&gt;June that six secret meetings were held in the past two years. But when

&gt;Inside Israel just before the elections asked Netanyahu to comment on

&gt;the meetings, he denied they had ever taken place.

&gt;

&gt;Perhaps the most secret and worrying ties concern what is supposedly a

&gt;high-tech services company. Yediot Ahronot relates how Netanyahu wooed

&gt;a local Likud leader. "He was invited by Netanyahu to a meeting in his

&gt;office at Systematics in Ramat Gan. The head of the company, Oded

&gt;Levental is a candidate for a financial post in the new government."

&gt;

&gt;Systematics is at the core of serious research by American alternative

&gt;publications, including the usually reliable Media Bypass. In short,

&gt;the allegations are that the National Security Agency had handed

&gt;Systematics stolen software called Promis that opened a trap door to

&gt;the world's secret banking transactions. About 250 Americans, mostly

&gt;politicians, had their illegal foreign accounts emptied of over $3.5

&gt;billion in the operation. It is claimed that Colin Powell dropped out

&gt;of the presidential race after his account electronically vanished.

&gt;Leading figures in the operation included George Bush, Caspar

&gt;Weinberger and two Arkansas attorneys, Vince Foster Jr. and Hillary

&gt;Rodham Clinton on behalf of Clinton financier Jackson Stephens. The

&gt;research invariably concludes that Foster was murdered because he knew

&gt;too much about the scam.

&gt;

&gt;A leading investigative writer, Sherman Skolnick, writes:

&gt;

&gt;"Some contend Systematics is an NSA proprietary and spies on banks

&gt;overseas. Can Systematics rightfully deny spying actually done by

&gt;buffers or cut-outs between Systematics and NSA? Systematics, through a

&gt;spokesperson, vigorously denies Foster assisted it in any spying on

&gt;foreign banks but remains apparently silent on whether Hillary Rodham

&gt;Clinton assisted Systematics in some nefarious activities."

&gt;

&gt;Is it fair to ask why Systematics provided Netanyahu office space and

&gt;if this was the sum total of its involvement with him?

&gt;

&gt;Since taking office, Netanyahu has fueled fears of international

&gt;control by his actions within Israel's tiny anti-NWO community. They

&gt;were most intrigued by his refusal to give Ariel Sharon a sensitive

&gt;cabinet post. One possible reason is fear of Sharon's own intelligence

&gt;arm in the US. Then for those people who fervently hoped that he would

&gt;rid himself of any connections to the Arye Deri scandal, with all its

&gt;implications of money laundering and perhaps murder, Netanyahu

&gt;appointed as his Justice Minister, Yaacov Neeman, a lawyer who is

&gt;currently being investigated for intimidating a key witness against

&gt;Deri in a London trial.

&gt;

&gt;But the topper was Netanyahu's decision to allow Yaacov Frenkel to run

&gt;the country's economy single-handedly. Frenkel worked for the World

&gt;Bank between 1971-1990. After nineteen years away from "home" Frenkel

&gt;was unexplainedly appointed head of the Bank of Israel.

&gt;

&gt;His policies mirrored the world-wide debt program of his previous

&gt;employer documented by numerous researchers. The plan involves raising

&gt;interest rates beyond what the public or industry can afford, and

&gt;forcing the government to borrow lots of money from American banks to

&gt;keep the populace pacified. When the debts have to be repaid from an

&gt;empty treasury, the International Monetary Fund bails out the country

&gt;with schemes guaranteed to impoverish the people.

&gt;

&gt;Frenkel was a proponent of Israel borrowing $10 billion in loans

&gt;guaranteed by the American government and he kept his interest rates as

&gt;high as he could in the face of opposition from then-Finance Minister

&gt;Avraham Shohat who suspected Frenkel, "was playing politics with the

&gt;Bank of Israel."

&gt;

&gt;Binyamin Netanyahu, the man who Inside Israel hoped would save Israel

&gt;from the NWO puppet regime of Peres, appointed Yaacov Frenkel to be his

&gt;Minister of Finance. The only thing that prevented the disaster was

&gt;party opposition to an appointee who had never publicly supported the

&gt;Likud.

&gt;

&gt;Dan Meridor got the post instead. But as the Maariv headline read:

&gt;"Meridor Will Act, Frenkel Will Lead." On his first day in office

&gt;Meridor announced that his policy would be to lower the standard of

&gt;living in Israel. Not a week later, Frenkel raised the interest rates

&gt;by a whopping 1.5% with Meridor's "approval."

&gt;

&gt;Something is going on behind the scenes at the CFR. While Secretary of

&gt;State Warren Christopher must appear to be opposing Likud government

&gt;policies to keep the Arabs in line, the former CFR director is playing

&gt;some kind of double game with Netanyahu.

&gt;

&gt;King Hussein made his accommodation with Netanyahu well before the

&gt;elections and refused to support Peres during the campaign. Netanyahu's

&gt;victory clearly delighted him and on the surface, why not? The last

&gt;thing he would want is a PLO state on his border with control of the

&gt;Moslem holy sites. In time, it will become clearer what Netanyahu

&gt;promised the King during the secret London meetings. Included, most

&gt;assuredly, will be Jordanian hegemony over the Temple Mount.

&gt;

&gt;There has been a transformation in Israel but the CFR is still running

&gt;the latest prime minister. And that is a good reason for intense fear

&gt;about Israel's future.
