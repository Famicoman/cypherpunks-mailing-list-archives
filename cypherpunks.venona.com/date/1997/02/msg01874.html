&gt; 	Umm... because you'll eventually accumulate _lots_ of addresses
&gt; that don't work, which will slow things down tremendously in sending
&gt; mail out?

The current subscription is between 1,000 and 2,000 I don't think that is
_lots_. All we need to do is count the number of bounces per address in
a given period, the SSZ end is trying to decide between weekly or
monthly cleanings, and then clear that address. At no point would I need
to archive the original bounce.

&gt; &gt;I can verify this. If I was not already having to deal with these problem
&gt; &gt;as a current mailing list operator I certainly would not take on the
&gt; &gt;job. It is one of the reasons I STRONGLY suggest anyone serious about this
&gt; &gt;should use the resources to make money as well. Anyone capable of setting up
&gt; &gt;and operating such a remailer system is at least capable of basic skills.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Well, loki@cyberpass.net has made the offer to host the entire
&gt; list... and Lance is certainly making money at it. While this would have
&gt; some problems in comparison with the distributed list idea (namely more of
&gt; a choke point), it would decidedly help.

I certainly hope they get a cpunks address made available. I will certainly
subscribe cpunks@ssz so that the distributed remailer will benefit from 
that input. However, one of the major realizations is that as long as one
anything is involved in the list it is capable of being shutdown at any
time with no warning. It also makes it much easier to compromise. I would
like to see servers in several countries myself.

&gt; &gt;Is anyone interested in acting as a mail-to-news gateway?

Want to volunteer?
