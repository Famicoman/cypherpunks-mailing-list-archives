How do you encourage people to use resources more-or-less wisely?

1.  The socialist/nanny model - take charge and give 'em orders

We've tried that and it apparently didn't work out.

2.  The market model - charge people for what they use

A while back, omebody suggested a system which would be self-funding, by
charging people for each post they made.  Maybe we should try it?  If
each little piece of ASCII art cost a poster a buck or two to send, he
might send fewer.  On the other hand, we don't want to discourage
interesting posters, so I think some system to reimburse interesting
posters would be useful.

I'm not the guy to set up the system, but I'll happily buy a modest amount
of "posting tickets."

&gt; Sandy has agreed to continue moderation through the end of the
&gt; original 1-month experiment (through Feb 19).  And it's a good thing,
&gt; too, because the "cypherpunks community" had better get off its
&gt; whining butt in the next ten days, or it will no longer exist.
&gt; 
&gt; I've come to the conclusion that I'm not willing to host the
&gt; cypherpunks list any more.  It's not the true assholes that brought me
&gt; to this decision; it's the reaction from the bulk of people on the
&gt; list: suspicion, flamage, and criticism with every attempt to improve
&gt; things.  I noticed few people volunteering some of their own time,
&gt; money, or machines to help out.  Almost all the suggestions were
