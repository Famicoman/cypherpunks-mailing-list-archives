&gt;
&gt;alt.cypherpunks is an unmoderated newsgroup, needed as a replacement
&gt;for the high volume Cypherpunks mailing list, which is being evicted
&gt;from its longtime home at toad.com due to creative differences with
&gt;the site owner, John Gilmore. 
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;alt.cypherpunks  Technological defenses for privacy
&gt;
&gt;Some background on Cypherpunks, snipped from the mailing list welcome
&gt;message, follows...
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it. 
&gt;Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for
&gt;themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or other large,
&gt;faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence. 
&gt;Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for
&gt;centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and couriers. 
&gt;Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their
&gt;experiences or their opinions. 
&gt;
&gt;The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To
&gt;encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with weak
&gt;cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Cypherpunks
&gt;hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best to defend it. 
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish to
&gt;learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of it. 
&gt;Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures. 
&gt;Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to defend it.  Cypherpunks
&gt;know just how hard it is to make good cryptosystems. 
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key
&gt;cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail
&gt;forwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love to
&gt;play with secure communications of all kinds. 
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to
&gt;defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, they're going to write it. 
&gt;Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks may
&gt;practice and play with it.  Cypherpunks realize that security is not built
&gt;in a day and are patient with incremental progress. 
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write. 
&gt;Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.  Cypherpunks know that
&gt;a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. 
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.
