	It is wrong ( at least in the US ) to call someone when specifically 
asked not to do so.  In addition, while junk mail costs *me* nothing, junk fax
and phone calls do.  I pay for my phone service; I pay for my fax, toner, and
paper.  If they use my property without getting permission first, I believe
that *is* ( or should be ) illegal.  Your argument that my plugging a fax 
machine itno a phone line I know it will answer, even if it is unauthorized,
is tantamount to saying that if I leave my keys in my car, anyone can take
it, and legally so!  While it may be foolish to do that, being foolish is not 
a crime ( yet!  And how could Congress pass that!  They would be the first 
violators!)
