&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A pentium is definitely up to this task.  I've been running it the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; whole time on a slower 40MB SPARCstation-2 (that also runs netnews and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; general computing).  Give it a big /var/spool partition (mine is 60MB)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; because every message will sit in the queue for days (*somebody* on
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the list will have an unreachable name server or MX server until the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; msg times out).  Give it lots of RAM and paging space, since each
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sendmail process takes about 2MB virtual, 1.4MB physical, and you will
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; have dozens running at the same time.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;My approach to this problem has been to use a 1G drive and mount the entire
&gt;&gt;file system on it. Swap and MS-Dos each get their own partitions. This
&gt;&gt;allows the use of the entire drive as a buffer. I am in the process of
&gt;&gt;adding another 1G in approx. two weeks with the intent of moving /home off
&gt;&gt;the main drive. This not only gives the system more space but the users as
&gt;&gt;well. I set swap to 4x main ram. I use Linux and have it as one giant
&gt;&gt;partition even though suggested is blocks of 16M, works for me (YMMV). Would
&gt;&gt;be minor to monitor df and alarm when it gets to 200M or something.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I must admit however that I am looking at a faster mbrd. and a bigger hard
&gt;&gt;drive in the immediate future to make up for the extra load I expect. Had
&gt;&gt;not really planned on the remailer project however...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; You'll need a BIG mailbox for the bounce messages, and someone (or
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; some unwritten software) to scan it every day or two and delete the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; lusers whose mailboxes are full or who dumped their account without
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; unsubscribing.  The bounce mailbox on toad gets between 1 and 4MB of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; email a day; more when the list is under attack.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;How about dumping the bounces to /dev/null? I shure don't care if some
&gt;&gt;bozo's (other than mine that is) mailbox goes away.
&gt;
&gt;	Umm... because you'll eventually accumulate _lots_ of addresses
&gt;that don't work, which will slow things down tremendously in sending
&gt;mail out?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The real issue is how willing you are to put your own time into
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; dealing with problems.  Not only do things go wrong by themselves, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there are malicious assholes in the world who will deliberately make
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; trouble for you just because they like to.  Spending a day or two
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; cleaning up the mess is just part of the job.  Check your level of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; committment two or three times before taking on the task -- so you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; won't end up getting disgusted after a month or two and putting the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; list's existence into crisis again.  It's not a "set it up and forget
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; it" kind of operation.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can verify this. If I was not already having to deal with these problem
&gt;&gt;as a current mailing list operator I certainly would not take on the
&gt;&gt;job. It is one of the reasons I STRONGLY suggest anyone serious about this
&gt;&gt;should use the resources to make money as well. Anyone capable of setting up
&gt;&gt;and operating such a remailer system is at least capable of basic skills.
&gt;
&gt;	Well, loki@cyberpass.net has made the offer to host the entire
&gt;list... and Lance is certainly making money at it. While this would have
&gt;some problems in comparison with the distributed list idea (namely more of
&gt;a choke point), it would decidedly help.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Another suggestion may be to set sendmail expire option to one day
&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of five so that messages that cannot be delivered would bounce
&gt;&gt;&gt; faster and not clog the queue.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I like this idea very much. Myself I would set it for like 4 hours or so and
&gt;&gt;if it couldn't be delivered then bye bye. Another motivation for selective
&gt;&gt;sites to operate as archives without themselves being remailers.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Another issue related to this is at what point to unsubscribe accounts. It
&gt;&gt;seems to me that if the address times out some number of times it should be
&gt;&gt;deleted.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is anyone interested in acting as a mail-to-news gateway?
&gt;
