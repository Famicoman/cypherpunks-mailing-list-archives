&gt; 	Well, if you can't deliver mail because their mailbox is full, then
&gt; you should simply wait a few days before trying to deliver mail to that
&gt; address. If it's because the address isn't there any more, you should delete
&gt; it from the subscription lists. Otherwise, the instant people's mail quotas
&gt; overflow (e.g., they're on AOL and they haven't been able to get through the
&gt; clogged lines), they get bounced... or you're left with a lot of invalid
&gt; addresses.

If their mailbox is full I might let it sit a day. If I still get a bounce
after that I currently yank it. As I stated earlier, I am currently trying to
decide if daily or weekly purges are in order. I personaly lean toward daily.
I certainly am not buying disk space just so somebody else can use it for
storing things they don't personaly have room for.

&gt; The address causing the bounce is not necessarily determinable
&gt; automatically from the bounce message; if it isn't, then you need to keep a
&gt; copy around for a human to look at.

Hmmm, to date I haven't had a problem determining where the cause was
from the bounces I see. I can't always tell why but it always seems to
say whose email address was involved.

&gt; 	Given that there are pre-existing news-mail gateways, I'd think that
&gt; the programs should be available. My concern on the programming is more in
&gt; the realm of keeping the thing up and running.

If you get it up and running there should be no programming involved. Unless
you want to reconfigure.
