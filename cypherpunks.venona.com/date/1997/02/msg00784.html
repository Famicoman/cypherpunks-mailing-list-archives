I've just got the details on two new crypto chips produced by the Dutch company
Pijnenburg Custom Chips B.V.  These are the PCC 201 bignum coprocessor and the
PCC 101 DES-with-everything processor (the official names are slightly
different :-).  The PCC 101 sells for approximately US$27, the PCC 201 sells
for approximately US$50 (for people who aren't familiar with the market for
these things, these are very good prices, especially for the 201).
 
The PCC 201 is officially a "Large number modular arithmetic coprocessor" which
is designed to perform the operations:
 
  A^x mod N
  AB mod N
  C mod n
 
very quickly for quantities of up to 1024 bits.  Typical procesing times for
1K-bit operands is 40ms, for 512 bits it's 12ms when clocked at 25 MHz.
Unfortunately you can't directly chain them for larger operands, although it's
possible to use two 201's and some software tricks for CRT decrypts to stretch
the operand size to &gt; 1024 bits.
 
The way the 201 works is that you load the fixed components (exponent and
modulus for A^x mod N, modulus only for AB mod N and C mod N) into one of three
sets of on-chip registers, and then use them to perform arbitrary numbers of
operations on data.  This means that for something like a micropayment
application you would load the necessary private key components once and then
generate signatures at the (theoretical) rate of 25 a second.  To date the cost
of this kind of hardware has been such that the most viable solution was to run
racks full of cheap P5 boards booting a bare-bones RSA-processing application
through a network card, but with the PCC 201 you could populate a board with
201's and a few microcontrollers a la a Wiener machine and use these as a
payment transaction processing engine.  They'd also make fairly cool SSL
co-processors for web servers.
 
The PCC 101, officially a "DES encryption device", does DES, 3DES (EDE with 2
or 3 keys), and DESX in ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and MAC modes at a maximum rate of
132 Mbits/s (16.5 Mbytes/sec) for single DES, or 1/3 that for 3DES, when
clocked at 33 MHz.  It's possible to load either single or triple-DES encrypted
keys which are then decrypted using onboard key encryption keys (KEKs).  The
chip contains onboard storage for 24 keys, 3 KEKs, 4 IV's, and 2 DESX keys
(pre/post-whitener).  Processing is done in a 3-stage pipeline, so once you
feed in 3 64-bit blocks it churns out a new result every 16 clocks (this also
allows overlapped I/O operation).  You can add an external battery to save the
internal state when power is removed, so you could keep your keys permanently
stored onboard (although given that these keys can be recovered given enough
money and effort I'm not sure if this is a good thing).
 
The PCC 101 is available in 44-pin PLCC/TQFP packages, the PCC 201 is available
in 68-pin PLCC and 80-pin TQFP packages.   The PCC 201 contains a multiplexed
address/data bus and a few control signals (most of the pins are unused), the
PCC 101 contains data and address ports and a few control signals.  They look
fairly easy to interface.  There's an ISA evaluation board available which
contains the PCC 201 and the slightly older PCC 100 (predecessor of the 101)
and some test software.  Note that this is an evaluation board only, Pijnenburg
make the chips but don't sell general encryption cards.
 
A fast PCI card containing these chips and drivers for various common operating
systems and MSDOS is currently being designed by an international cabal.  This
will be a PCI 2.1-compliant card containing a PCC101, an optional PCC201, and
possibly a few other things (we're still arguing about the design).  I'll be
writing DOS and Win16 drivers for it, and someone else will do an NT and
possibly Linux driver (again, it's still at the design stage).  cryptlib
(<A  HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib.html</A>) will probably end up
having native support for it when it's ready.
 
Pijnenburg don't have a web page yet but are working on it, I'll post the
details here when it becomes available.  Until then you can contact them at
asic@pijnenburg.nl.  The only slight problem is that they're subject to the
Dutch governments export rules (the usual Wassenaar stuff) which means that if
you're not using it for an authentication/integrity-only application or a
financial application, you'll probably need to go through some paperwork to
show that it's for your use only and you won't be passing it on to your friend
Jose from Columbia.  Pijnenburg have a standard Statement of Application which
people can use as to write their own statement for export approval.
 
These chips look *very* promising.  Who needs Clipper, or HP's
Clipper-under-another-name, when you can get triple DES from the free world at
prices like this?
 
Peter.
