&gt; &gt; &gt;If the people decide for creation of a new USENET newsgroup,
&gt; &gt; &gt;we need to think very hard about actually moving it to a different
&gt; &gt; &gt;hierarchy from alt.*. I would propose comp.org.cypherpunks,
&gt; &gt; &gt;comp.cypherpunks, sci.crypt.cypherpunks or something like that.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;A comp.* or sci.* newsgroup, if created, has the following advantages
&gt; &gt; &gt;over an alt.* newsgroup:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;1) There is usually less spam in sci.* or comp.*
&gt; &gt; &gt;2) There are virtually no completely irrelevant flamewars
&gt; &gt; &gt;3) The propagation will be a lot better
&gt; &gt; &gt;4) More people will be able to read it because of the issue of providers
&gt; &gt; &gt;   not carrying alt.*.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I see nothing that would make a sci.* or comp.* newsgroup  worse than
&gt; &gt; &gt;alt.* newsgroup.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sure, and this has come up in every past discussion of creating
&gt; &gt; "alt.cypherpunks."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But the creation of alt.cypherpunks is _easy_, and needs little permission
&gt; &gt; or support, whereas the creation of "soc.culture.cypherpunks" or whatever
&gt; &gt; takes work, requires a vote, blah blah blah. And so it never gets off the
&gt; &gt; ground.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (Nor is it clear to me, and perhaps not to others, that it belongs in the
&gt; &gt; the various places Igor mentioned. Comp.org.cypherpunks probably is the
&gt; &gt; best fit, but then many would cite the "comp" part to try to insist that
&gt; &gt; only _computer_ topics be discussed. Likewise, the "soc" domain would skew
&gt; &gt; discussion...etc. "Alt" has the nice advantage of explicitly not be part of
&gt; &gt; sci, or comp, or soc, or even talk.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; (I apologize to everyone whose e-mail has gone unanswered this week - I've
&gt; had a bunch of other stuff to do, but I'll get to it eventually. Also, 
&gt; I posted
&gt; the Anshel+Goldfield zeta function paten number - do check it out.)
&gt; 
&gt; Random thoughts:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A newsgroup like comp.privacy.cypherpunks will be carried on a lot of
&gt; corprate news servers that don't carry alt.* (or even soc.*). Note that
&gt; soc.org.cypherpunks is inappropriate since cp is *not* an organization. :-)
&gt; Another possibility is sci.crypto.cypherpunks. (True, people whose corporate
&gt; newsservers don't carry soc.* and talk.* can use dejanews - provided their
&gt; firewall lets them.)

&gt; 2. It takes more work to create a comp.* newsgroup than an alt newsgroup.
&gt; It takes a vote. I'm willing to be one of the proponents and generally help
&gt; with the process. (Both I and Igor have been co-proponents of major Usenet
&gt; newsgroups - don't know about other people onthis list. :-)

Not only it takes a vote. What is more important is what a vote gives: 
a good discussion of the newsgroup and the formal RFD/RFD/CFV process
ensures that, on average, a good balance is found between various groups
of readers.

I am not concerned as to what the name of the group will be, it is
not important. What is important is that it should be in a more or
less flame-free zone.

It is too late to stop alt.cypherpunks, but if I had to make a
prediction again, I would predict that soon posters will BEG to help
them create comp.*.cypherpunks, because of spam and alt.flamage.

&gt; 3. An unmoderated Usenet newsgroup would have even ore crap than this mailing
&gt; list. I've been thinking of how to deal with crap, and with the obvious desire
&gt; by some people to delegate their decision what to read and what not to read
&gt; to other people. 

It is alt.* and soc.* that has most crap, sci and comp are way better.

&gt; Most people don't have nocem-enabled newareaders yet... Which is where the
&gt; network of cypherpunks majordomos Igor's been busy creating comes in very
&gt; handy. 
&gt; 

It is a very good idea to let NoCeM issuers and filterers work 
independently from list nodes.

	- Igor.
