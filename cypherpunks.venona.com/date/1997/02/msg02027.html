&gt; Subject: Re: Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer (fwd)
&gt; 
&gt; 	Someone with more experience correct me if I'm wrong (I'm just
&gt; starting to learn about mailing list management), but isn't saving
&gt; at least the first bounce from a given address good in order to check
&gt; what address is the one that's actually bouncing? Admittedly, this only
&gt; applies to badly-formed bounces. The rest can just have the address
&gt; noted.

Hmmm, I can see saving the address causing the bounce in some sort of array
that is indexed to the majordomo subscription list for a given remailer. It
would not cost anything but overhead to save the entire message. I guess my
motivation was not that I cared their mailbox was full or it was a invalid
address but that I wouldn't be able to deliver at this time. I just don't
see any reason that it helps me to know why they can't receive mail only that
they can't.

&gt; &gt;Want to volunteer?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Give me some idea of how much programming knowledge, time, etcetera
&gt; is required, please, before I can answer. I'd be renting space on some other
&gt; computer (e.g., an account on cyberpass.net) to do it in; the only higher-level
&gt; programming language (i.e., beyond Applesoft Basic) that I know anything of
&gt; is Perl (and I don't know that all that well); and I am somewhat busy with
&gt; other stuff. In other words, it depends.

Hmmm, not shure how much programming it would take - never done it myself.
I think Perl would be an acceptable language. I certainly hope to do the
majority of the scripts on the CDR in Perl myself. Perhaps there is somebody
who knows the fine points of how INN cache's messages. Redbeard and I had a
short discussion about this issue today relating to tracking messages to
reduce mail-loops. I will discuss it with him and see what happens.

I know exactly what you mean. I have two full-time jobs and hadn't really
thought of taking on the cpunks list in any manner. But hey, that is the
spice in life...

Give me a couple of days to look at the situation and if somebody don't beat
me to it I'll post what I find out. Cool?
