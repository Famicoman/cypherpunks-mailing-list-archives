DAY ONE
March 19, 1997
Chairman: Brad W. Smith, President, WBS &amp; A, Ltd.

       8:30 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS ON INTERNET
       PUBLIC OFFERINGS
       This session will review the many regulatory and legislative
       issues involved in the development of Internet public
       offerings. In particular, how and why the regulatory bodies
       of the NASD, NASDAQ and the SEC are making a
       commitment to the Internet as a vehicle that serves the
       investor. Proper surveillance procedures have been created and
       executed to protect all parties. Internet initiatives have been
       developed to bridge the market side and regulatory side of
       these complex issues.
       Al Dandridge, Associate Director of Corporate Finance
       U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

       Charles Bennett, Associate Director of Corporate Finance
       NASD

       9:30 INTERNET TRADING MARKET PROJECTIONS
       Internet trading is an emerging market wave that is poised for
       explosive growth. More than 60 million investors have
       brokerage accounts. The media reports that Internet brokerage
       accounts will jump from 1.5 million today to 9.3 million by
       the year 2001; Every bank will use the Internet to attract
       customers and deliver services in the next five years and
       electronic commerce will grow to $600 billion annually
       within the next 10 years. Visionaries believe that one of the
       most profound effects of these phenomena's will be to
       changehow small businesses get capitalized. They predict that
       small business public offerings will become routine for
       nano-cap companies.
       This session will present a strategic overview of the
       emergence of internet capabilities that make it possible for
       investors to invest in and trade nano-cap company stocks.
       Brad Smith, President
       WBS &amp; A, Ltd.

       11:00 GOING PUBLIC: HOW TO RAISE CAPITAL
       THROUGH A DIRECT PUBLIC OFFERING (DPO) This
       session will explore from concept to completion, how to
       perform all of the necessary functions to prepare and market a
       DPO and/or an Internet DPO. A case study will be shared of a
       DPO that will be presented to the investment community
       world-wide in early 1997. Learn from the experts the
       specifics on how to take your company where you want to go
       and ensure success including:
              Marketing through an investor relations firm
              Choosing an appropriate analyst
              Utilizing a transfer agent
              The link between broker and internet commerce
       David A. Levonian, President
       INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR RELATIONS
       <A  HREF="http://iirwebtv.net">http://iirwebtv.net</A>

       1:00 OVERCOMING THE PITFALLS AND
       CHALLENGES OF GOING PUBLIC
       The advantages of "going public" appear straight forward. The
       company accesses the capital it needs to expand or refine its
       product. (In a purely coincidental occurrence, the current
       shareholder [including investment bankers, SEC lawyers and
       stock brokers] get rich.)
       There are numerous challenges in conquering the process of
       "going public" including:
              There are problems with the lawyers, accountants
              and the bankers and they are on YOUR SIDE
              There are pounds of paper forms which must be
              submitted to every group, not to mention the SEC.
              However, an approved offering does not make a
              successful offering. It still must be marketed,
              either by stock brokers OR MAYBE directly over
              the Internet. And not just to the U.S., but to the
              entire world.
              That may be the wave of the future. Direct access to
              securities and their offering companies over the
              Internet.
       Michael J. Waddell, President
       PROMARKETING, INC.
       Developer of the (<A  HREF="http://www.freemarket.org">http://www.freemarket.org</A>) selected by
       PC Novice Guide to the Web as one of the Internet "Greatest
       Sites"

       2:00 IPONET: SELLING &amp; ADVERTISING IPO'S ON THE
       INTERNET: THE CREATION OF THE FIRST
       PERMANENT SYNDICATE
       IPOnet is currently the only site on the Internet with
       clearance from the SEC to advertise and sell new security
       offerings online.
       IPOnet intends to have multiple Broker/Dealers listed on it's
       site.
       This will create the first permanent syndicate of
       Broker/Dealers.
       These Broker/Dealers will act as selected dealers for each
       others offerings and act as underwriters of their own
       offerings.
       This session will examine the following topics:
              Why the broker can not be eliminated from the
              offerings
              What really happens when an IPO is put on the
              Internet
              Why DPO's will never be a major threat to brokers
              Why a permanent syndicate will foster the creation
              of new offerings

       3:30 THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADITIONAL
       EXCHANGES AS A SECONDARY MARKET
       Taking your company public via the Internet, rather than the
       traditional exchange, has become a very viable alternative for
       small business owners. However, unless the offering is
       backed by a complete marketing plan, it is unlikely that the
       offering will reap huge financial rewards and achieve success.
       Incorporating a traditional exchange as a secondary market
       into the plan can solidify, stabilize and extend the offering
       beyond the Internet marketplace and create longevity and
       security and financial return on your offering. This session
       will explore secondary markets and how traditional
       exchanges are advocating the collaborative efforts of
       traditional and web offerings.

       Listing Sales

       4:30 Panel Discussion: PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND THE
       INTERNET: LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
       Join three of the most influential Internet finance and
       securities attorneys for this highly interactive session. They
       will discuss the legal aspects associated with buying and
       selling securities on the Internet, including private
       placement, Regulation A offerings and independent public
       offerings. Come prepared to share your challenges and
       solutions!

DAY TWO
March 20, 1997

       8:15 ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARDS FOR BID AND
       ASK OFFERS: THE EMERGENCE OF DIRECT STOCK
       MARKET
       The secondary market is the key to successful initial and direct
       public offerings. The traditional brokerage community has
       their hands tied when it comes to underwriting and making
       markets in small company issues. A new strata of corporate
       finance is being created by technological advances which
       marry capital requirements of entrepreneurs with risk/return
       and information demands of investors. This presentation will
       explore:
              Using the internet to raise capital for your company
              Secondary market trading on the Internet
              Virtual roadshows online

       population than before. This session will examine how to
       cultivate these partnerships, foster growth and secure

              partnering with co-opitition
              Attracting "qualified" people to your site
