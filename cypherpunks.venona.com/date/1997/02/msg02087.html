&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. A newsgroup like comp.privacy.cypherpunks will be carried on a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; corprate news servers that don't carry alt.* (or even soc.*). Note that
&gt; &gt; &gt; soc.org.cypherpunks is inappropriate since cp is *not* an organization. :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another possibility is sci.crypto.cypherpunks. (True, people whose corporat
&gt; &gt; &gt; newsservers don't carry soc.* and talk.* can use dejanews - provided their
&gt; &gt; &gt; firewall lets them.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. It takes more work to create a comp.* newsgroup than an alt newsgroup.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It takes a vote. I'm willing to be one of the proponents and generally help
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the process. (Both I and Igor have been co-proponents of major Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups - don't know about other people onthis list. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not only it takes a vote. What is more important is what a vote gives:
&gt; &gt; a good discussion of the newsgroup and the formal RFD/RFD/CFV process
&gt; &gt; ensures that, on average, a good balance is found between various groups
&gt; &gt; of readers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not concerned as to what the name of the group will be, it is
&gt; &gt; not important. What is important is that it should be in a more or
&gt; &gt; less flame-free zone.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm concerned about smart people stuck behind corporate firewalls
&gt; and able to see comp.* and sci.*. Nearly every big Wall St firm
&gt; is that way. Did I ever relate to you the story how I had to
&gt; break through the firwall at GS to accomplish mywork?

Would be interesting.

&gt; &gt; It is too late to stop alt.cypherpunks, but if I had to make a
&gt; &gt; prediction again, I would predict that soon posters will BEG to help
&gt; &gt; them create comp.*.cypherpunks, because of spam and alt.flamage.
&gt; 
&gt; Timmy has a valid point: the reason why a comp.* newsgroup might have less
&gt; cross-posted and "off-topic" crap is because net.cops would be more
&gt; likely to complain to posters' sysadmins. Having a charter state that
&gt; cypherpunks have technical means to ignore traffic they don't like,
&gt; and don't need anyone forging cancels or complaining to sysadmins
&gt; or otherwise getting silenced, is a good idea.

It is not only because of that. There are two categories of people
who simply do not visit com.* groups: sex spammers and trollers
(who post articles like I RAPED A NIGGER CHILD to tens of newsgroups).

If the group is created in a space that is isolated from them, that is
already good.

As for net.cops, check out what Scott Nudds does in comp.lang.c++

&gt; What's going to happen when (not if) someone posts something in
&gt; alt.cypherpunks that Chris Lewis (spit) judges to be "spam"
&gt; and forges a cancel? Or someone posts a binary and Richard
&gt; "little dick" Depew forges a cancel?

Chris Lewis can exclude newsgroups from his spam watch. I think that
if cypherpunks put something forbidding third party cancels into the
charter, he will not cancel stuff posted there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. An unmoderated Usenet newsgroup would have even ore crap than this maili
&gt; &gt; &gt; list. I've been thinking of how to deal with crap, and with the obvious des
&gt; &gt; &gt; by some people to delegate their decision what to read and what not to read
&gt; &gt; &gt; to other people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is alt.* and soc.* that has most crap, sci and comp are way better.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a bunch of net.cops in e.g. comp.lang.eiffel that complain to
&gt; sysadmins of anyone posting to that newsgroup who's in a member of the
&gt; "in" crowd". It may or may not cut down on the crap, but is it worth it?

Yes, there is a notorious net.cop The Right Reverend Colin James III (spit).

A sample of his stukachestvo is attached at the bottom of this letter.

| 
| The solution is very simple and cool (IMHO). 
| 
| In the same file where you define INT16, UINT32, etc, add the following: 
| 
| #ifdef AIX
|   typedef long INT32;
|   #define F_INT32 "ld"
| 
|   typedef unsigned short UINT16;
|   #define F_UINT16 "u"
| #endif
| 
| #ifdef YOUR_FAVORITE_MACHINE
|   typedef short INT32; // Maybe for 64-bit machines, never worked with them
|   #define F_INT32 "d"
| ... etc etc ...
| 
| Then you define your user types: 
| 
|   typedef INT32 DollarAmount_t;
|   #define DollarAmount_f INT32_F // You make it a rule to define
|                                  // formats right along with types
| 
| Usually, in scanf (and printf) people write things like this: 
| 
|       printf( "%ld is the dollar amount for customer %4.4d\n", 
|               amount, cust );
| 
| Instead, you write
| 
|       printf( "%" DollarAmount_f " is the dollar amount for customer "
|               "%4.4" Cust_f,
|               amount, cust );
| 
| It is a totally portable code. All you need to port primitive types 
| is to recompile it.
