&gt; Mr. Murray gave a long, impassioned speech.
&gt; 
&gt; He was very emphatic about not trusting anything
&gt; that the government says, and that once they got
&gt; their "foot in the door", that they would seek to
&gt; expand their abilities to regulate, etc, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; He advocated deployment of strong crypto. He
&gt; insisted that there was no way the government
&gt; could stop the export of strong crypto. He exhorted
&gt; people to refuse to obey the ITAR/EAR regulations,
&gt; and to lobby their congresscritters to get the
&gt; PRO-CODE bill passed.
&gt; 
&gt; It wasn't really what he said that amazed me, because
&gt; I had heard most of it (in bits and pieces) before. It
&gt; was presenting it all in a package, in an emotional
&gt; manner, by an elderly, conseratively dressed
&gt; accountant who was representing a large
&gt; corporation whose job it is to help people obey the
&gt; government.

    I was in attendance at an ISSA conference earlier this year where Mr. 
Murray gave the "keynote" speech on Electronic Commerce.  While he did 
strongly advocate the adoption of strong crypto and various methods of 
security, he never stepped into the more radical mode of encouraging 
people to break the law.  That was a different audience though.

    As he is also an ex-25 year IBM veteran it amazes me that he would 
make such a public outcry against govt. regulations (okay, so it's a 
stereotype).  Deloitte &amp; Touche must really have a big stake in the 
pro-crypto market or else he actually cares a lot.
