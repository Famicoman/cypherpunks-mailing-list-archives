&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember dale, you and dr. vulis are also beating on john gilmore &amp; co.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; True, but, Smith viciously attacked me before I said anything about
&gt; &gt; &gt; him, and he did so not because I was some kind of authority inter-
&gt; &gt; &gt; fering with his life (like a lying, cheating, censoring list mgr.),
&gt; &gt; &gt; but simply because he didn't like my posts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; :) and you are attacking him because you did not like his posts.
&gt; 
&gt; Not the same thing at all.  Any posts he may have made about any
&gt; list topic (whether "on-topic" or not) I did not jump on him for.

Oh well, and he did not jump on Dr. Vulis for any posts concerning
the list topic.

&gt; I have made specific comments disagreeing with people about factual
&gt; or theoretical particulars, or I've made disparaging comments about
&gt; list "leaders" using their "reputation capital" to shove other people
&gt; out of their way like bullies, but I haven't taken to calling
&gt; ordinary list subscribers names because I think they're paranoid
&gt; (which I'm really not, though I'm a "professional" conspiratologist),
&gt; or because I otherwise disagree with them.

Well, paranoid people may be more right than "normal" people, so I
do not see the word paranoid as an insult.

&gt; I looked at one archive the other day, and it contained 850+ messages
&gt; by me posted to cypherpunks between approximately 1 Sep 96 and late
&gt; Jan 97.  I think you'll find them very consistent, and although I
&gt; could be accused of harboring my own arrogance in some areas, I can
&gt; handle any criticism you put forth, since you (for example) don't
&gt; slander me gratuitously or viciously.

Mmm, maybe, but I remember saying negative things about some of your
ideas, which I still think were not wrong.

&gt; Several months ago, I made a post where I said that approx. 95% of
&gt; people stay within the confines of their parents' religion for life,
&gt; meaning that while they may change denominations, or split different
&gt; hairs on various dogmas, they still remain Catholic if their parents
&gt; were Catholic, etc.  One of the list "leaders" chose to say I didn't
&gt; know what I was talking about, even though I very well did know what
&gt; I was talking about (and I told him so), so he replied that he didn't
&gt; want me putting his email address in any of my posts (i.e., don't
&gt; hit the reply-to-all button unless I manually delete his name), and
&gt; has steadfastly ignored me ever since.  I don't mind being ignored,
&gt; in fact, it gives me time to do better things than argue with persons
&gt; who don't really listen, but what pisses me off is this bully-like
&gt; arrogance on the part of some of the clique who would really like to
&gt; get rid of people like me, but can't recommend it since it would
&gt; damage their already fragile reputation.

This is OK, Dale, if some readers follow the bullies with reputations
instead of doing their own thinking, they are not worthy of your worries.
