Hi,

I received two copies of the Pretty Good Privacy
Pre-Alpha Source Code and two copies of the
update.

I've donated one copy to the CWI math library in
Amsterdam <http://www.cwi.nl>, this copy will be
available for lending in about 3-4 weeks.

The other copy needs to be scanned, so if you can
convince me that if I give it to you it will be
scanned and uploaded to the Internet, I will send
it to you, and it is yours to keep !

(don't think lightly is 10 cm high about 2000+ pages)
- - - - part 1     0 - 598   
- - - - part 2   599 - 1138
- - - - part 3  1139 - 1582
- - - - update     0 - 312

Please submit request to <usura@berserk.com>

Sincerely,
- --
