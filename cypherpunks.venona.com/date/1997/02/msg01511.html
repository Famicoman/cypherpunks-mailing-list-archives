&gt; &gt; Why was this message (attached below) sent to the "Flames" list? (*) It

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (* I have temporarily subscribed to the Flames list to see just what it is

&gt; &gt; the header "Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com," thus I surmise it
&gt; &gt; is a "Flames" message. It would help, by the way, if messages were more
&gt; &gt; clearly labelled by the Moderator as to which bucket he placed them in.)
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, there are three lists.  It looks as though the message
&gt; in question appeared on the Unedited list.  This is NOT the same
&gt; as the Flames list.  
&gt;  
&gt; I don't recall where I sorted that particular post to after I
&gt; read it on the Unedited list.  If it went to the "wrong" list,
&gt; my apologies to the author.  As I indicated before, I don't think

I am attaching Vulis's posting below, so that the mistake could be
corrected.

Judging by the dates in the headers, it went to flames list in
3 seconds after arrival to toad.com.

That makes me think that somehow it got routed there without human
involvement.

&gt; a 100% solution is possible, but I think I'm running in the high
&gt; 90s under the criteria I enunciated.  Not perfection, but a 
&gt; definite improvement over the prior condition.

I see three problems with the current state of the list: 

	1) There is no charter and no criteria that I am aware of, so 
	   your 90% statement is meaningless
	2) Moderation policy has not been set (or voted upon) by the readers,
	   therefore it was not optimised to serve the readers
	3) Crypto-relevant posts, not containing any flames, get
	   rejected.

&gt; C'punks --
&gt; 	When I told a friend about the alt.drugs.pot cultivation newsgroup
&gt; and suggested that he use an anonymous remailer to post to the group,
&gt; he laughed and said, "Who do you suppose runs the remailers?  ATF,
&gt; FBI, DEA, that's who!"  Gee, it makes sense to this paranoid.  Does
&gt; anyone know the answer?  Specifically, how can we choose a trusted
&gt; remailer?

Even if the feds are not directtly involved, the so-called "cypher punk"
remailers are run by people who should not be trusted.  Check out their
remailer-operators list: it's full of announcements that some specific
person posted something via the remailer that the operator didn't like.
