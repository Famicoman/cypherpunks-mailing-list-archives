&gt; &gt; the really important issue is this: is the _physical hosting_ of the
&gt; &gt; Cypherpunks mailing list coterminous with the "Cypherpunks"?
&gt; { much thoughtful and well-phrased commentary elided }
&gt; &gt; I would have had no problem had John announced that he was creating
&gt; &gt; a new list, the "Good Stuff" list, with Sandy has his Chooser of
&gt; &gt; Good Stuff.  But by making the _main list_ the censored one, this
&gt; &gt; skewed things considerably.

&gt; Now that the horse is out of the barn, ( or maybe not? ), I can't help
&gt; but ask whether one specific 'change to the change' would have
&gt; satisfied most of your objections:  retaining 'cypherpunks' as the
&gt; name of the unedited, all-the-crud-you-can-read-and-then-some,
&gt; version, and adding an 'cp-worthwhile' list for those of us who prefer
&gt; not to wade thru mountains of garbage to glean a few precious tidbits.
&gt; What's in a name?  Is perception more important ( to you ) than
&gt; reality?  If just swapping names between cp and cp-unedited would make
&gt; such a large difference, I humbly suggest to you that you consider how
&gt; much labels need to matter.  Is the title of the group more important
&gt; the the content?  From where I sit, this looks a lot like a
&gt; style-over-substance complaint.  Of course, I don't have my trifocals
&gt; on just at the moment.

If it did not suit a specific purpose, they wouldn't have done it
that way.  You can take it to the bank that they did this because
it was the only way to keep the 1300-plus sheep subscribed to what
they wanted to be their "main" list.
