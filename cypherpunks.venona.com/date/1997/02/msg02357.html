Read this and you will understand why we must 
take heed of these dangerous homosexuals who have
infiltrated Usenet in the past five years, ever since
David Lawrence took over.  J.D. Falk, the perverted
child molester from the D.C. area has had a lot to do with
this take-over by the homosexuals.  Read Dr. Vulis's account of
the last 10 years here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...  Remember the previous cypherpunk who stated that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gays "created and run usenet."
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was on the list last month, and the person was serious and correct.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is exactly why we must now kill all of usenet as it stands, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; a new heterosexual beginning.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...  We are here to
&gt; &gt; &gt; "rip new assholes" in the faggots who have ruined the net thus far,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and to take over and make this net heterosexual oriented.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So if I follow your argument, gays created and run usenet, and have
&gt; 
&gt; Not true. Homos created Fidonet. Tom Jenkins was one. Normal people created
&gt; Usenet. (That is, some of the people who created Usenet may well have been
&gt; sexually attracted to people of the same sex in real life - I don't have a
&gt; problem with that - but none of them were "Usenet faggots" who tried to
&gt; suppress free speech). Now the homos, who ruined Fidonet through
&gt; censorship and UDP-like wars, are trying to take over Usenet with the same
&gt; disasterous results.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; also ruined it thus far.  Can you just clarify a few points?  I'm
&gt; &gt; trying to follow your premise here [which I don't necessarily
&gt; &gt; believe], and it seems contradictory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   * If gays ruined usenet, does that mean at one point usenet was a
&gt; &gt;     good thing before it was ruined?  If so, gay people at least
&gt; &gt;     deserve credit for creating something good, even if they didn't
&gt; &gt;     manage to run it well.
&gt; 
&gt; Suppose for argument's sake that the people who created Usenet all
&gt; happened to be gay. Why would "gay people" as a whole, most of whom
&gt; had nothing to do with it, deserve credit for it?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * If Usenet was created and ruined by terrible people, what exactly
&gt; &gt;     is your interest in it?  Why don't you just create an alternate
&gt; &gt;     news network.  You can easily do this using software these gay
&gt; &gt;     people have so graciously given you the source for, and then you
&gt; &gt;     could be the authority over the entire heterosexual news
&gt; &gt;     hierarchy.
&gt; 
&gt; We were here first. I've been on Usenet for &gt; 10 years, before most of the
&gt; scum that's trying to ruin it now. Besides, the homos will try to ruin any
&gt; alternative forum they think is used by their "enemies". Look how they've
&gt; been flooding the freedom-knights mailing list with shit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * If people you consider gay can't hold any position of authority on
&gt; &gt;     the internet, why do you acknowledge their authority by trying to
&gt; &gt;     fight them in particular?  I mean, what authority do these gay
&gt; &gt;     people have over a gay, ruined usenet that's so important you need
&gt; &gt;     to rip new assholes in them?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just don't understand whom you are fighting over what and why.
&gt; 
&gt; Good question. I'm fighting against _actions that suppress speech - such
&gt; as complaints to postmasters that result in plug-pulling; or forged cancels.
&gt; If false complaints were universally ignored - cancels junked, postmaster
&gt; complaints junked, as they should be, then these actions would be just
&gt; speech, therefore not worthy of suppression. I don't want the homos to be
&gt; silenced, merely rendered impotent to silence others.
&gt; 

The queer named J.D. Falk and the little queer called
Timmy Skirvin are also to blame for much of the shit we now
have present today.

Trust only Dave Hayes for an uncensored full-feed.
