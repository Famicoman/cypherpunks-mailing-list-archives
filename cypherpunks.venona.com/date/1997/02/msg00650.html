This is where the distributed nature of the list comes   in.

if someone disagrees with Jim's AUP, he or she can use soem other

&gt; &gt; Please explain how making submissions de facto public domain censors
&gt; &gt; anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; What the fuck is "de facto public domain"? It's public domain, or it's
&gt; not. 
&gt; 
&gt; Your scheme imposes a cost (loss of intellectual property rights)
&gt; against authors who would like to make themselves heard. It also
&gt; prevents a certain class of messages (those messages whose status is
&gt; "copyright claimed") from being distributed. Further, your suggestion
&gt; that posters be required to include a "fair use header" is compelled
&gt; speech.
&gt; 
&gt; That's three flavors of "censorship" right there. I thought that the new
&gt; list(s) were supposed to allow anyone to say anything they wanted. 
&gt; 
&gt; (Does "no fair use" count as a "fair use header"? It's not legally
&gt; enforceable, but it seems like the easiest way to specify "minimum fair
&gt; use required by law". If not, are you planning to moderate the list to
&gt; make sure that people use only approved fair use headers? Hmm.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Even if the "copyright abandonment by implication" trick works (and I
&gt; suspect it will not, given that an assignment or transfer of copyright
&gt; must be in writing, 17 USC 204; and abandonment is essentially an
&gt; assignment or transfer to the public domain), it will not apply to all
&gt; text sent to the list. A person cannot abandon or assign something they
&gt; do not have; so if someone sends a message to the list which contains
&gt; text whose copyright is held by a third party, that copyright will still
&gt; be valid. 
&gt; 
&gt; So what you've got is a list where you can't be sure that its contents
&gt; are public domain, and a draconian rule requiring authors to give up
&gt; their rights to what they've written.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you imagine that all of the many-majordomo servers will implement
&gt; your "public domain only" rule, or only yours? 
&gt; 
&gt; If the rule only applies to the ssz.com version, what's the point?
&gt; 
&gt; If the rule is intended to apply to all servers, and servers aren't
&gt; going to be allowed into the network without agreeing to implement it
&gt; locally, um, tell me again about that "free speech" thing? Aren't you
&gt; just taking advantage of your position as a person working on the
&gt; many-majordomos project to impose your ideas about intellectual property
&gt; on the rest of the list? Is such a strategy compatible with "free
&gt; speech"? 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, how could a rule like this possibly be compatible with a Usenet
&gt; gateway? There's no chance at all that you can expand a local rule on
&gt; your system to all of Usenet through a gateway.

&gt; &gt;I forward articles to cypherpunks that are copyrighted by my employers, or
&gt; &gt;magazines like Playboy and Wired for which I write freelance pieces. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I like to think these articles have some value. I will not forward any of
&gt; &gt;them, nor would I be able to, if they magically became "public domain."
&gt; 
&gt; Which are good points - also, don't forget that, from time to time,
&gt; people have even posted code to the cpunks list, and many software
&gt; authors like to retain copyright in their code so that they can insist
&gt; on things like noncommercial distribtion or credit where the code is
&gt; reused. If a work is truly "public domain", the author has no power to
&gt; insist on those things. 
&gt; 
&gt; This proposed rule seems to limit postings to those which are perceived
&gt; by their authors to be without commercial or reputational value. Is that
&gt; a good idea?
