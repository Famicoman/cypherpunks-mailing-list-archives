Now the punks are sending me "good luck" letters...

What a bunch of losers. No wonder they bend over for Gilmore.

&gt;                        St. Jude
&gt; 
&gt;         Kiss someone you love when you get this letter and make magic.  This
&gt; paper was sent to you for good luck.  The original copy is in New England.  I
&gt; has been around the world nine times.  The Luck has been sent to you.  You
&gt; will receive good luck in four days.  This is no joke.  You will receive it i
&gt; the mail.  send copies to people that you think need good luck.  Don't send
&gt; money as fate has no price.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
&gt; hands in 96 hours.  An Air Force officer received $70,000 in four days.  Joe
&gt; Elliot received $40,000 and lost it because he broke the chain.  While in the
&gt; Philippines, Gene Wolf lost his wife six days after receiving this letter.  H
&gt; failed to circulate the letter.  However, before he death, she won $50,000 in
&gt; a lottery.  The money was transferred to him four days after he decided to
&gt; mail this letter.  Please make twenty copies of this letter and see what
&gt; happens in four days.  The chain comes from South Venezuela and was written b
&gt; Saint Anthony Decroc, a missionary from South America.  Since the copy must
&gt; make a tour of the world, you must make twenty copies and send them to your
&gt; friends and associates.  After a few days you will get a surprise.  This is
&gt; true even though you are not superstitious.  So note the following: 
&gt; Constantine Dens received the chain in 1958.  He asked his secretary to make
&gt; twenty copies and send them out.  A few days later he won the lottery of 2
&gt; million dollars.  Andy Doddit, and office employee, received a letter and
&gt; forgot it had to leave his hands within 96 hours, he lost his job.  Later,
&gt; after finding the letter again, he mailed out twenty copies.  A few days late
&gt; he got a better job.
&gt; Please send no money.  Please don't ignore this.  IT DOES WORK.
