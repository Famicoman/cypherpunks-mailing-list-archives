	Lets take this to an extreme to make a point.  Would it be right to
rape someone, if afterwards you gave them the fair market value of what you
did?  In no case does it make it more tolerable for me; in addition, if I *do*
accept money for their "service", then I tacitly approve of their tactics!
BTW< this also answers the reply I got ( sorry, I forgot who from ) that 
explains a way to set up two mail accts, one for spam and one regular acct.
