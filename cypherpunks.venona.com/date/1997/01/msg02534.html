No-Nonsense Response Rate Guarantee:

There are many scams alive on the Internet.
Although the Net represents the greatest opportunity for a business to
expand and grow that has ever existed, dozens of "snake-oil" purveyers
prey on such businesspeople daily.

 Bulk Email Advertising is, in effect, the grass-roots basis at the
 foundation of all Net
advertising.
 It is effective, economical, fast, relatively inexpensive
(in comparison with other media, sometimes almost ridiculously so); in
short - it works! The only glitch with this new advertising media is
the con artists, as we have mentioned.

 Quantum Communications is committed
to providing a quality service to advertisers at a reasonable price.
No, we do not offer to supposedly send out a billion email ads for
$39. No legitimate company can afford to promise that AND actually do
it. Unfortunately, by the time most advertisers find that out, they
have lost their money. We believe, instead, in guaranteeing our
responses at a minimum level so each and every advertiser can rest
assured that their money is well spent. We guarantee the following
minimum responses to your advertising piece. If the responses do not
reach the minimum amount, we will continue to include your piece in
our co-op (if it was a co-op), or we will continue to mail the piece
by itself, in sufficient amounts until the minimum responses are
reached. These replies are only the POSITIVE responses and inquiries.
Flames or negative replies, etc. are filtered by us, and you never see
them! (they of course are NOT counted towards your minimum response
guarantee).

 Minimum Responses:
 General Bulk Email: 100 replies per 200k pieces sent

"MEGA-MAILER"  Co-Op Bulk Email:  200 replies

Targeted Bulk Email: 150 replies per 5,000 pieces sent (3.%!)

 As you will notice, this fixes the MAXIMUM cost PER REPLY at $2-3.
 Knowing how much each reply will cost you AT THE MOST allows you to
 plan your marketing budget and plan for success!

This also causes us to take extra care when helping to examine your ad
copy and suggest any revisions. Professional ad copy design is
available for a surcharge of $80 per hour.
 We have a stake in making sure you succeed! We
have many references who will vouch for our resolve and character as a
company. Please feel free to call and speak with them. Also, feel free
to either email us ( staff@quantcom.com) or call our offices at (603)
772-4096 and speak with us at any time Mon-Fri, 9AM to 7PM EST

PAYMENT FOR SERVICES:
We accept personal and business checks and money orders. We DO NOT
accept credit cards at this time. If you would like to utilize your
credit card, we recommend you get a cash advance from the card and

All payments remitted must be in U.S. funds, drawn on a U.S. bank.

the same account numbers are visible. 
Account name: 
Bank Name,City,&amp; State:
Amount:$ 
Check #: 
Authorized Signature: 
Transit #:
(also referred to as the ABA routing number, this is the group of
numbers which is usually in the lower left portion of the check and is
enclosed in funny looking brackets that look like this |: The number
is exactly 9 digits long.)
 Account # :
(Another group of
numbers on the bottom edge of the check, should be the rest of the
numbers there besides the transit #. The check # should be part of
this grouping also. )

*** If you have any questions about
which numbers are which, simply call your bank and ask them what your
account # and transit # (or ABA routing #) are.***
