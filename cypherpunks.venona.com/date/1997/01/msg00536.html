&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;These postings do not prove that libel is a crime. It is because libel
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;is not a crime. Libel is a tort, and unlike with crime, the government
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cannot initiate a legal action against someone for libel. Only injured
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(libeled) individuals and not the government can sue in a libel case.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; On the contrary, in some jurisdictions libel is indeed a crime. However, 
&gt; &gt;&gt; that doesn't mean that prosecutions happen anymore, but the laws are (in 
&gt; &gt;&gt; some places) still  on the books.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Jim, either you are full of shit or that Law is VERY
&gt; &gt;unconstitutional.  The first amendment prohibits any Criminal Laws
&gt; &gt;from being made against libel.
&gt; 
&gt; You'd think that, wouldn't you?  Yes, I agree that those laws are 
&gt; unconstitutional, but so is about 90+% of what the Federal government does 
&gt; today.  Sigh.
&gt; 
&gt; Criminal libel statutes are apparently (in the US, at least) a holdover from 
&gt; an earlier era in which government took the place of King George, and wanted 
&gt; the power to punish people who were too outspoken.  The fact that they are 
&gt; "never" (?) used anymore is presumably a reflection of their 
&gt; unconstitutionality.  Criminal libel statues should also be considered 
&gt; unconstitutional because they give way too much leeway to the prosecutor to 
&gt; decide whom to prosecute.  His friends will never be charged, but his 
&gt; enemies will.
&gt; 
&gt; One obvious problem with the LACK of a criminal libel statute, from the 
&gt; standpoint of the "government-controlling-class," or "the bigshots," is that 
&gt; it's impossible to sue (and collect from) a (comparatively) poor person for 
&gt; defaming him...but it's still possible to put him in jail.  Civil libel is, 
&gt; therefore, essentially useless to a government agent as a means of keeping 
&gt; the masses in line.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Myself, I believe that libel should be eliminated as a cause of action in 
&gt; civil cases as well as it has, de facto, in the criminal area.  If anything, 
&gt; the ability to sue for libel makes things worse:  There is an illusion that 
&gt; this is easy and straightforward, if not economical.  It is neither.  The 
&gt; result is that people are actually MORE likely to believe a printed 
&gt; falsehood because they incorrectly assume that if it wasn't true, it 
&gt; couldn't be printed.
&gt; 
&gt;

Interesting analysis here, but remember; libel is just one kind of
"defamation" and an action for defamation will always be actionable.

The constitution gives us the right to call the President a
motherfucker any time we want to, and it also gives the motherfucker
the right to sue.  Sueing is better than fighting in the streets.

This is the SLOWEST I have ever seen Telnet, today.
