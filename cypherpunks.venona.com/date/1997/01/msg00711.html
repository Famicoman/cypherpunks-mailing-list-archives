&gt;
&gt;         20 years ago, the Vietnam protests were just dying down. the
&gt;     movie industry which has been one of the more vocal anti-war
&gt;     centers (except in making violent war movies which make money) was
&gt;     still somewhat respectful of the USG.

Was the media industry really anti-war, or just anti-Nixon? When Lyndon
Johnson sent the troops to 'Nam, the media first supported him. When Nixon got
elected, against the media's wishes, the media attacked him over everything he
was doing, including the war, just like they attacked Reagan and Bush. I'm
usure if Nixon had pulled out completely in '69, the media would have been
pro-war. They're whores, like Declan McCulough.

Bombing the hell out of North Viet Nam targets was evil, but effective. But:
compare the way USD is portrayed in _Apocalypse Now &amp; _Deer Hunter (a
monolythic machine servings some sinister purpose and killing the natives;
white people are safe; the rogue gets terminated by USG itself) with the way
it's portrayed in _Rambo and _Red Dawn (gubmint abandons the pow's*, abandons
the locals; useless, but barely evil, and it's not clear how far up the evil
goes) and with the way it's been portrayed in this year's movies: _Courage
Under Fire (a bunch of criminals trying to cover up their fuckup, all the way
to the top); _Ransom (the main villain is a NYC cop, other cops are useless;
it's not Federales, but close enough); _Eraser ("rogue" WitSec, the cops are
the enemies); _Professional (the top villain works for the DEA). Pop movies
reflect the attitudes of the audience they're made for.

Dr. Grubor is a Viet Nam vet. I have great respect for him.

*) Klinton's being paid by the Indonesians to "normalize" relation with VC,
incorporated by reference.

&gt;         Other than the liberals who give Bubba a birthday party
&gt;     --probably more for their own publicity (except Barbra), most
&gt;     everybody is getting fed up with the government and beginning to
&gt;     realize the USG not only over governs, but the public is also
&gt;     beginning to understand the usurpation of power, and the basic
&gt;     unconstitutionality of the regulatory agencies.
&gt;
&gt;         Utah is as good an example as any; they have never been
&gt;     Fed supportive (even if it was Republican), but the church mandate
&gt;     is to support the government --however, they are quickly swinging
&gt;     to a large majority which not only does not like the Federal
&gt;     government, but who are also actively stating the government is
&gt;     illegal--  and the church is silent.
&gt;
&gt;         The other Intermountain states have been just plain independent
&gt;     minded, but tolerated the Feds. Not any more.  Idaho and eastern
&gt;     Washington are not a safe place for the Feds.  Montana makes no
&gt;     bones about it; Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are vocal. And AZ
&gt;     is as pissed as they come over the MJ pronouncement "--what do you
&gt;     mean the Feds are telling us our vote is worthless and our States'
&gt;     Rights don't mean pig shit."  Nobody particularly cares about the
&gt;     MJ, it's the pure and simple emphasis on States' Rights and the
&gt;     Voters' Rights to self-determination and the 10th Amendment.
&gt;
&gt;         Analysis of California attitudes is even more revealing; the
&gt;     statement the DEA would pull prescription permits from doctors
&gt;     prescribing maryjane in AZ and CA has stirred a firestorm which
&gt;     will only get larger.

Is that why the criminal Usenet Cabal is interfering with the propagation
of sci.med.cannabis and other MJ-related Usenet newsgroups?

&gt;             The people spoke and the Feds said: "Fuck You!"
&gt;
&gt;         The question then is, how long before the Eastern whimps and
&gt;     liberal tit suckers wake up and realize they too are about to lose
&gt;     the option of being liberal tit suckers?
&gt;
&gt;         Of all things, MJ may be the last straw (going up in smoke
&gt;     &lt;g&gt;); now, if the press will get off their sensationalism on the
&gt;     CDA and talk about what it is we are really fighting --free speech
&gt;     as a whole, Thomas Jefferson might wake up one day soon and say:
&gt;     "Alright!  but it took you stupid bastards more than the 20 years
&gt;     to have a little revolution to teach Washington who the government
&gt;     serves!"

I have little regard for Thomas Jefferson and rest of the "founding fathers"
gang. Their revolution replaced one bunch of oppressors with another; no
wonder it was followed by Shay's (sp?) Rebellion (whose farmer leaders were
sentenced to hang for treason; later commuted); and Alien and Sedition Acts.

&gt;         Maybe Bubba needs a little more cocaine so he gets "brave"
&gt;     enough to call in UN troops to quell a riot...   then WE watch the
&gt;     fun. Some of you sissies might even lift your hardware and watch
&gt;     your first melon explode.  After the first one, it's easy.
&gt;
&gt;         For the first time a civilized nation has full gun
&gt;         registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more
&gt;         efficient, and the world will follow our lead in the
&gt;         future.
&gt;                     --Adolf Hitler (1935)
&gt;
&gt;     Is Adolf's future here again?

I had a great-grandfather named Adolf.  The Communists killed him.

&gt;         46. The U.S. government declares a ban on the possession,
&gt;         sale, transportation, and transfer of all non-sporting
&gt;         firearms.  ...Consider the following statement:
&gt;
&gt;             I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist
&gt;             confiscation of firearms banned by the U.S. government.
&gt;
&gt;                 --The USMC Combat Arms Survey
&gt;
&gt;     The same survey had questions of obeying commands from UN officers,
&gt;     and obeying commands from UN officers on US territory, and against
&gt;     US citizens.  Anybody who wants a copy of the whole survey, send
&gt;     me email.
&gt;
&gt;         This was not somebody's master thesis; on some special
&gt;     operations bases it was given by a major, others a light bird, etc.
&gt;     all SEALS and USMC spec-op groups were given the "test"  --the
&gt;     younger men were &gt;85% compliant; the reuppers and lifers were real
&gt;     low on compliance (~15%).  Our PC and revisionist history has built
&gt;     the generation they want: functionally illiterate "world-oriented"
&gt;     cannon fodder.

How does one brainwash a brainless "cypher punk"?
