&gt;Encrypted Email For Finns, Swedes, Danes
&gt;    by Sami Kuusela
&gt;
&gt;    4:43 pm PST 23 Jan 97 - While keeping a watchful eye on the emerging
&gt;    American encryption policy, Scandinavian countries are embarking
&gt;    on a joint project to implement the first international email security
&gt;    service.
&gt;
&gt;    Nordic Post Security Service (NPSS) - involving Finland, Norway,
&gt;    Sweden, and Denmark - hopes to provide secure email, and
&gt;    officials say that soon every Nordic citizen can walk into the
&gt;    nearest post office and sign up for it.
&gt;
&gt;    But no matter the success of the secure email system, the NPSS
&gt;    project is a clear sign that, unlike the United States, Northern
&gt;    Europe is moving forward with exporting encryption technology
&gt;    across national barriers.
&gt;
&gt;    "Finnish policy has not been to start with regulations and fear of
&gt;    Net issues," says Anu Lamberg, the head of the Information
&gt;    Network Unit in the Finnish Ministry of Transport and
&gt;    Communications. "The American discussion on this matter has
&gt;    been funny to watch, but I hope nobody in Europe or Finland starts
&gt;    to question the very basics of democracy."
&gt;
&gt;    Based on PGP, with no "third-party" key holder, the Nordic system
&gt;    uses unbreakable RSA-algorithm encryption with a 1024-bit key.
&gt;
&gt;    However, some hardware is required. Because the key is on a
&gt;    smartcard, users must have smartcard readers installed on their
&gt;    computers, which aren't yet widely available. But Pdr Andler of
&gt;    Finnish Hewlett Packard says that later this year, smartcard readers
&gt;    will become standard on computers in Scandinavia. "It is a really
&gt;    big help for users, who don't have to remember dozens of
&gt;    passwords when using different kind of services," Andler says.
&gt;
&gt;    The project has been moderately successful in Finland - the first
&gt;    Nordic country to offer the secure email - as the system isn't any
&gt;    more difficult to use than a standard email program. All the user
&gt;    has to do is click "send."
&gt;
&gt;    For project developers, using strong crypto was never an issue.
&gt;    "From the very beginning we've been basing this on strong crypto,"
&gt;    says Vesa-Pekka Moilanen, technical director for Finland Post, and
&gt;    mastermind of the email project. "At first, the customers are going
&gt;    to be mainly professionals," he says, "but quite soon private
&gt;    individuals will start using it." But the use of secure email probably
&gt;    won't be widespread until 1998 - if then.
&gt;
&gt;    "If strong crypto is banned it's going to have major effects on the
&gt;    development of information society," says Risto Siilasmaa, the
&gt;    CEO and president of DataFellows, one of the only makers of
&gt;    encryption programs in Finland. The Finnish government awarded
&gt;    DataFellows "most innovative company" honors in 1996. "But
&gt;    nobody is going to limit strong crypto. I haven't met a single
&gt;    leading Nordic official who says otherwise."
&gt;
&gt;    One question, though: What if a Nordic citizen enters the United
&gt;    States with the email program installed on his or her laptop? For
&gt;    now, Nordic officials are only beginning to contemplate the
&gt;    ramifications.
