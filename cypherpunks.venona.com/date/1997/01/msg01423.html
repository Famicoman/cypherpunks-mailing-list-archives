<PRE>
&gt; I think that the move to human moderation is a good thing, and am pleased
&gt; that Sandy will shortly begin to act as moderator.

Last night's barrage of SPAM convinced me that this is a really good
thing. 
 
&gt; However, I think that forming lists of "approved people" and "unapproved
&gt; people" and treating them differently is likely to do more harm than good,
&gt; even if we have nice software which does it very efficiently. I don't like
&gt; it for several reasons:

Why jump to conclusions about the moderator's behavior?  Lets give the
new moderators a chance - PLEASE!!!

I think our new moderators have been around long enough to know
what's appropriate and what's not. I for one am getting really tired of
seeing so many off topic messages (not necessary SPAM) on here. I have
been tempted to unsubscribe a couple of times, but I haven't because I
don't want to miss information on the DES/RC5 Challenge and other
important info.

I have been on well moderated lists, as well as had to ask a friend of
mine who was on a closed list to forward postings to me (I couldn't get on
the approved list because I hadn't sent them $20).

&gt; 1.	Political. It's symbolically disturbing, and it tends to shift the focus
&gt; of the group (and of the moderation process) away from messages, and
&gt; towards the people who post them. I think it'd be tempting to turn it into
&gt; some sort of bureaucratic system, with punishments (being on the bad list)

In the case of this one closed list that I know of, I'd agree with you,
but I'd argue that this isn't generaly true. Let me ask you this: How many
of the messages posted to this list have you actualy read/found useful? 

I personaly don't find more than perhaps 5% useful.

&gt; 2.	Technical. It requires that the people on the "good list" authenticate
&gt; their messages (otherwise people will post with the names of "good people"
&gt; to avoid moderation), which imports a lot of hassle with different
&gt; platforms and signing and certification and key distribution and [...]
&gt; which we don't have good solutions for yet.

I sort of see your point, but I don't think we have to go that far. A
moderator's main function is one of keeping the discussions on track (Ie.
SPAM selling Metamucil doesn't qualify). Authentication goes a little
beyond that. I think forcing authentication will really turn this into
a political problem.

Good luck Sandy and other moderator!

Bernie
