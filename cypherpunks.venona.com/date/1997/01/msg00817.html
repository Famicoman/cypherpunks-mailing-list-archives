Accuracy will depend on the quality of the original being scanned, as 
well as the capability of the OCR system; flat originals scan much better 
than the "bent open" pages of a book or magazine, heavy stock tends to 
let less "bleed" through from the reverse side, fonts with extreme 
kerning are more difficult, point size is a factor, etc.

I've seen 97%+ w/ Calera, (about 2 years ago) when using flat, first
generation high quality photocopies w/ minimal skew and courier or similar
typeface. OTOH, the same system did not scan well at all w/ badly skewed
photocopies (caused by the "bend" induced by the binding of the original).
If you are scanning medical journals, take a look at your originals and
also at where the errors are occuring. 

You can also use a spell checker (after building up a suitable dictionary 
for your application) to cut out some of the error.

I'd guess your results to be less satisfactory for other applications 
where extreme accuracy is a must. "3", "8", and "B" for example, are 
often confused; not a big problem w/ a medical journal, but plays havoc 
w/ code, accouting data, etc.

&gt; 	I'd like to know what OCR software you were using.  All tests we
&gt; completed at my place of employment were very poor quality wise.  We
&gt; showed
&gt; a %65 accuracy rate.  Not very good when you need to transfer a five
&gt; year
&gt; backlog of medical and technical journals.  This was using a high
&gt; resolution
&gt; scanner with a package that was bundled along with it.  About a year
&gt; ago,
&gt; my employer considered transfering data taken off of forms into a
&gt; relational
&gt; database using an OCR program.  Again, we found the findings to be too
&gt; innacurate for our needs.  I may have just been using the wrong programs
&gt; for
&gt; the job, but the findings were depressing...
