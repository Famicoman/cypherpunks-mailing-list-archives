&gt; If what you say is true, then Dr. DV K's efforts are quite possibly 
&gt; the most important issue being addressed in this conference, because
&gt; behind free speech, lies the most important issue of all--when does

  As a long time lurker (much longer than many of the numerous
relatively recent vociferous posters) I *must* speak up.
  If the dear "Doctor's" posting are indeed a "grand" experiment
in newsgroup (or maillist) sociology, then it seems they are akin to
experiments in recent history; if the patient dies, so what? There are
other lists...
  While many of you think that the ability of a list to withstand
constant spamming is an important issue; the government is busily
working to outlaw encryption and privacy, and I fear that much
is lost by the side issue of the "how easily can I kill a list".
I feel we at a *critical* crossroads in this debate, and one of the
more important voices has *very* effectively been silenced.

&gt;   The military-industrial complex proclaims this necessary for the
&gt; purposes of state-security, and denies that it is used in order to keep 
&gt; their 'sins' from being exposed. (If you believe this, then please 
&gt; contact me by private email regarding an ocean-front property I have
&gt; available in Tucson, AZ.  If you act quickly, I will throw in a set
&gt; of the Amazing Ginzu Knives as an added bonus.)

  This is very true, but I cannot understand why you think that
the attempt to disrupt and destroy this list a necessary step
in the task of resisting this governmental effort.

&gt;   As far as I am concerned, any CypherPunk who believes that the
&gt; socio/politico issues surrounding cryptography are not important
&gt; enough to be an integral part of this list is falling into the
&gt; same type of trap as those who think that they can become good
&gt; cryptographers without becoming good cryptanalysts.

  Again, I can't understand why "killing the messenger" is advancing
the issues of privacy and crypto issues. How does the posting of
numerous crude anti-Tim May messages promote personal privacy?

&gt; &gt; "In peacetime, a warlike man sets upon himself." -- Nietzsche
&gt;   "In times of war, a peacelike man sets upon others."

  This seems horribly to describe the current situation.
