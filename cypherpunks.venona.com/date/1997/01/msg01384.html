I have been reading the comments on moderation and I have a few comments on
it...

I would like to see moderation, but only for those things that filters
cannot handle effectivly.

1) The Spam that has been flooding the list.  It looks like someone has an
axe to grind against the list or certain people on it, so they are doing
their best to disrupt it.  The spam is only part of that attack.  It should
be dealt with as any other denial of service attack.

2) The anonymous flames against Tim May (or anyone else for that
matter...).  These messages contain no useful content.  They only serve to
allow certain overgrown juviniles to vent against people they dislike.

Killing the above would greatly improve the quality of the list. The rest
can be killed by filters.

As for the people who are crying "censor", I have seen little evidence that
the doom they predict is going to happen.  (I think that they revel in the
idea that they are the "persecuted masses" who are being hassled by "the
man".)  I have been on this list for a number of years.  (Since at least
1994, maybe earlier than that...) Sandy has been one of the more rational
voice on the list in that time and he has been here longer than I have.  (I
have not always agreed with him, but then again, I can think of no one that
I would agree with 100%.  Even myself...)  Hopefully the criteria used for
moderation will not be so heavy handed that the list becomes bland and
tasteless (like a high school textbook from Texas).

Just my $0.00002 worth...
