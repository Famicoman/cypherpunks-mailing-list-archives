&gt; *****************************
&gt; "GEEKONICS" IS JUST A BEGINNING
&gt; by John Woestendiek
&gt; Philadelphia Inquirer
&gt; Wed., January 8, 1997
&gt; *****************************
&gt; 
&gt; NEWS BULLETIN: Saying it will improve the education of children who
&gt; have grown up immersed in computer lingo, the school board in San
&gt; Jose, Calif., has officially designated computer English, or
&gt; "Geekonics", as a second language.
&gt; 
&gt; The historic vote on Geekonics - a combination of the word "geek" and
&gt; the word "phonics" - came just weeks after the Oakland school board
&gt; recognized black English, or Ebonics, as a distinct language.
&gt; 
&gt; "This entirely reconfigures our parameters," Milton "Floppy"
&gt; Macintosh, chairman of Geekonics Unlimited, said after the school
&gt; board became the first in the nation to recognize Geekonics.
&gt; "No longer are we preformatted for failure," Macintosh said during a
&gt; celebration that saw many Geekonics backers come dangerously close to
&gt; smiling. "Today, we are rebooting, implementing a program to process
&gt; the data we need to interface with all units of humanity."
&gt; 
&gt; Controversial and widely misunderstood, the Geekonics movement was
&gt; spawned in California's Silicon Valley, where many children have grown
&gt; up in households headed by computer technicians, programmers, engineers
&gt; and scientists who have lost ability to speak plain English and have
&gt; inadvertently passed on their high-tech vernacular to their children.
&gt; 
&gt; HELPING THE TRANSITION
&gt; 
&gt; While schools will not teach the language, increased teacher awareness
&gt; of Geekonics, proponents say, will help children make the transition
&gt; to standard English. Those students, in turn, could possibly help
&gt; their parents learn to speak in a manner that would lead listeners to
&gt; believe that they have actual blood coursing through their veins.
&gt; 
&gt; "Bit by bit, byte by byte, with the proper system development, with
&gt; nonpreemptive multitasking, I see no reason why we can't download the
&gt; data we need to modulate our oral output," Macintosh said. The
&gt; designation of Ebonics and Geekonics as languages reflects a growing
&gt; awareness of our nation's lingual diversity, experts say. Other groups
&gt; pushing for their own languages and/or vernaculars to be declared
&gt; official viewed the Geekonics vote as a step in the right direction.
&gt; 
&gt; "This is just, like, OK, you know, the most totally kewl thing, like,
&gt; ever," said Jennifer Notat-Albright, chairwoman of the Committee for
&gt; the Advancement of Valleyonics, headquartered in Southern California.
&gt; "I mean, like, you know?" she added.
&gt; 
&gt; THEY'RE HAPPY IN DIXIE
&gt; 
&gt; Yeee-hah," said Buford "Kudzu" Davis, president of the Dixionics
&gt; Coalition.  "Y'all gotta know I'm as happy as a tick on a sleeping
&gt; bloodhound about this." Spokesmen for several subchapters of Dixionics
&gt; - including Alabonics, Tennesonics and Louisionics - also said they
&gt; approved of the decision. Bill Flack, public information officer for
&gt; the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Bureaucratonics said that his
&gt; organization would not comment on the San Jose vote until it convened
&gt; a summit meeting, studied the impact, assessed the feasibility,
&gt; finalized a report and drafted a comprehensive action plan,
&gt; which, once it clears the appropriate subcommittees and is voted on,
&gt; will be made public to those who submit the proper information-request
&gt; forms.
&gt; 
&gt; Proponents of Ebonics heartily endorsed the designation of Geekonics
&gt; as an official language.
&gt; 
&gt; "I ain't got no problem wif it," said Earl E. Byrd, president of the
&gt; Ebonics Institute. "You ever try talkin' wif wunna dem computer dudes?
&gt; Don't matter if it be a white computer dude or a black computer dude;
&gt; it's like you be talkin' to a robot - RAM, DOS, undelete, MegaHertZ.
&gt; Ain't nobody understands.   But dey keep talkin' anyway. 'Sup wif dat?"
&gt; Those involved in the lingual diversity movement believe that only by
&gt; enacting many different English languages, in addition to all the
&gt; foreign ones practiced here, can we all end up happily speaking the
&gt; same boring one, becoming a nation that is both unified in its
&gt; diversity, and diversified in its unity.  Others say that makes no
&gt; sense at all. In any language.
