&gt; &gt; &gt; But seriously, I was just telling the folks over the weekend, if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; had my hand on the button, a lot of people would die very quickly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; As in The Day The Earth Stood Still, a single act of aggression would
&gt; &gt; &gt; suffice to be immediately terminated.

No trial, huh?

  The best place to begin, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the USA at least, would be the public freeways.  There you have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most acts of aggression in a short space, and the best pickings for
&gt; &gt; &gt; liquidation.  Give me the power, and I'll show you all those nifty
&gt; &gt; &gt; techno-ways of eliminating people that have been kept from the public
&gt; &gt; &gt; by our benevolent government ("sources and methods").
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I don't give a damn about someone "cutting me off", since I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; not aggressive enough (outside of my liquidation duties) to be bothered
&gt; &gt; &gt; by that in most cases.  I'm primarily concerned with vehicles who get
&gt; &gt; &gt; too close behind, who pass with no safety margin, etc.  I call these
&gt; &gt; &gt; people anal-compulsive (as opposed to anal-retentive).  You've seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; the videos on PBS, the various animal species whose male members
&gt; &gt; &gt; perform occasional "mounting" of others to intimidate.  There are a
&gt; &gt; &gt; large percentage of humans who try to do the same thing, demonstrating
&gt; &gt; &gt; that they (IMO) have no further need of their lives.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Boy, it is a fucking Bitch living in that L.A. traffic, huh?
&gt; 
&gt; I heard years ago that approximately 10% of the people on the street
&gt; are certifiably mentally unstable.  Multiply that by two at least for
&gt; Los Angeles (suburban L.A., actually, Hollywood for example is much
&gt; safer than Altadena or Westlake Village).
&gt; 

Just carry a gun all of the time when you go over there.

&gt; Quincy M.D. (the old TV show) did an excellent piece once on how a
&gt; person can more-or-less legally commit murder with a car, by passing
&gt; a deliberate act off as an "accident".  It's one area of our law
&gt; enforcement where the law (or rules) as stated by the state and as
&gt; enforced by the state cops don't even agree.
&gt; 

Maybe it is best to travel only on the net any more.
The highways are deathtraps.
