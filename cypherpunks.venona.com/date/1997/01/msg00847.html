*********************************************************

If you could make one improvement in your life for the
New Year what would that be?  Could it be a desire to  
achieve FREEDOM?? Freedom from worry? Freedom
to act on your dreams? Freedom to improve your lifestyle?  
Freedom from bills? Freedom to go where you want,  
when you want (with money as no object)? Freedom  
to get the things you always wanted but couldn’t afford?  
Freedom to help someone close to you (your parents,  
your spouse or "significant other", relatives, friends, neighbors,  
business associates, etc.)?  
What would this type of "Freedom" mean to you??  

Is it then worth a couple of minutes of your time to let us show  
you and your relatives or friends how to start earning  
over $500 a week;  then over $500 a day; and move on 
to earn over $10,000 a week in supplemental income?  
All in your spare time  --  even_while_you_sleep!! --  
That's right, I said ---  
++ "OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK!!!" ++  

For less than the price of a dinner for two in a nice restaurant,  
you can be on your way to making your dreams come true.  
No health fads, no "imitation" products, no scams, no schemes.  
Just convenient access to everyday products (like telephone and  
gasoline) that everybody you know uses  ---  we promise

&lt;&lt;&lt;If we reached you in error -- we apologize.  
To REMOVE, DO NOT USE THE "REPLY" BUTTON!!
Please send an E-mail to:  remove2@pleaseread.com
and you will be permentantly Removed from our database.&gt;&gt;&gt;
