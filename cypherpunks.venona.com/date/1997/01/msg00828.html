The solution to world peace?
  We KILL all of the 'violent' people.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         20 years ago, the Vietnam protests were just dying down. the
&gt; &gt;     movie industry which has been one of the more vocal anti-war
&gt; &gt;     centers (except in making violent war movies which make money) was
&gt; &gt;     still somewhat respectful of the USG.
&gt; 
&gt; Was the media industry really anti-war, or just anti-Nixon? When Lyndon
&gt; Johnson sent the troops to 'Nam, the media first supported him. When Nixon got
&gt; elected, against the media's wishes, the media attacked him over everything he
&gt; was doing, including the war, just like they attacked Reagan and Bush. I'm
&gt; usure if Nixon had pulled out completely in '69, the media would have been
&gt; pro-war. They're whores, like Declan McCulough.
&gt; 
&gt; Bombing the hell out of North Viet Nam targets was evil, but effective. But:
&gt; compare the way USD is portrayed in _Apocalypse Now &amp; _Deer Hunter (a
&gt; monolythic machine servings some sinister purpose and killing the natives;
&gt; white people are safe; the rogue gets terminated by USG itself) with the way
&gt; it's portrayed in _Rambo and _Red Dawn (gubmint abandons the pow's*, abandons
&gt; the locals; useless, but barely evil, and it's not clear how far up the evil
&gt; goes) and with the way it's been portrayed in this year's movies: _Courage
&gt; Under Fire (a bunch of criminals trying to cover up their fuckup, all the way
&gt; to the top); _Ransom (the main villain is a NYC cop, other cops are useless;
&gt; it's not Federales, but close enough); _Eraser ("rogue" WitSec, the cops are
&gt; the enemies); _Professional (the top villain works for the DEA). Pop movies
&gt; reflect the attitudes of the audience they're made for.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Grubor is a Viet Nam vet. I have great respect for him.
&gt; 
&gt; *) Klinton's being paid by the Indonesians to "normalize" relation with VC,
&gt; incorporated by reference.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;         Other than the liberals who give Bubba a birthday party
&gt; &gt;     --probably more for their own publicity (except Barbra), most
&gt; &gt;     everybody is getting fed up with the government and beginning to
&gt; &gt;     realize the USG not only over governs, but the public is also
&gt; &gt;     beginning to understand the usurpation of power, and the basic
&gt; &gt;     unconstitutionality of the regulatory agencies.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         Utah is as good an example as any; they have never been
&gt; &gt;     Fed supportive (even if it was Republican), but the church mandate
&gt; &gt;     is to support the government --however, they are quickly swinging
&gt; &gt;     to a large majority which not only does not like the Federal
&gt; &gt;     government, but who are also actively stating the government is
&gt; &gt;     illegal--  and the church is silent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         The other Intermountain states have been just plain independent
&gt; &gt;     minded, but tolerated the Feds. Not any more.  Idaho and eastern
&gt; &gt;     Washington are not a safe place for the Feds.  Montana makes no
&gt; &gt;     bones about it; Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are vocal. And AZ
&gt; &gt;     is as pissed as they come over the MJ pronouncement "--what do you
&gt; &gt;     mean the Feds are telling us our vote is worthless and our States'
&gt; &gt;     Rights don't mean pig shit."  Nobody particularly cares about the
&gt; &gt;     MJ, it's the pure and simple emphasis on States' Rights and the
&gt; &gt;     Voters' Rights to self-determination and the 10th Amendment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         Analysis of California attitudes is even more revealing; the
&gt; &gt;     statement the DEA would pull prescription permits from doctors
&gt; &gt;     prescribing maryjane in AZ and CA has stirred a firestorm which
&gt; &gt;     will only get larger.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that why the criminal Usenet Cabal is interfering with the propagation
&gt; of sci.med.cannabis and other MJ-related Usenet newsgroups?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;             The people spoke and the Feds said: "Fuck You!"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         The question then is, how long before the Eastern whimps and
&gt; &gt;     liberal tit suckers wake up and realize they too are about to lose
&gt; &gt;     the option of being liberal tit suckers?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         Of all things, MJ may be the last straw (going up in smoke
&gt; &gt;     &lt;g&gt;); now, if the press will get off their sensationalism on the
&gt; &gt;     CDA and talk about what it is we are really fighting --free speech
&gt; &gt;     as a whole, Thomas Jefferson might wake up one day soon and say:
&gt; &gt;     "Alright!  but it took you stupid bastards more than the 20 years
&gt; &gt;     to have a little revolution to teach Washington who the government
&gt; &gt;     serves!"
&gt; 
&gt; I have little regard for Thomas Jefferson and rest of the "founding fathers"
&gt; gang. Their revolution replaced one bunch of oppressors with another; no
&gt; wonder it was followed by Shay's (sp?) Rebellion (whose farmer leaders were
&gt; sentenced to hang for treason; later commuted); and Alien and Sedition Acts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;         Maybe Bubba needs a little more cocaine so he gets "brave"
&gt; &gt;     enough to call in UN troops to quell a riot...   then WE watch the
&gt; &gt;     fun. Some of you sissies might even lift your hardware and watch
&gt; &gt;     your first melon explode.  After the first one, it's easy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         For the first time a civilized nation has full gun
&gt; &gt;         registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more
&gt; &gt;         efficient, and the world will follow our lead in the
&gt; &gt;         future.
&gt; &gt;                     --Adolf Hitler (1935)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Is Adolf's future here again?
&gt; 
&gt; I had a great-grandfather named Adolf.  The Communists killed him.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;         46. The U.S. government declares a ban on the possession,
&gt; &gt;         sale, transportation, and transfer of all non-sporting
&gt; &gt;         firearms.  ...Consider the following statement:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;             I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist
&gt; &gt;             confiscation of firearms banned by the U.S. government.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;                 --The USMC Combat Arms Survey
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     The same survey had questions of obeying commands from UN officers,
&gt; &gt;     and obeying commands from UN officers on US territory, and against
&gt; &gt;     US citizens.  Anybody who wants a copy of the whole survey, send
&gt; &gt;     me email.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         This was not somebody's master thesis; on some special
&gt; &gt;     operations bases it was given by a major, others a light bird, etc.
&gt; &gt;     all SEALS and USMC spec-op groups were given the "test"  --the
&gt; &gt;     younger men were &gt;85% compliant; the reuppers and lifers were real
&gt; &gt;     low on compliance (~15%).  Our PC and revisionist history has built
&gt; &gt;     the generation they want: functionally illiterate "world-oriented"
&gt; &gt;     cannon fodder.
&gt; 
&gt; How does one brainwash a brainless "cypher punk"?
