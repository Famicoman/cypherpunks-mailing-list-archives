        the pieces of our own destruction by a universal government of 
    a few are all there, many fully documented as bits and pieces; 
    someone who does not have a well known interest in the conspiracy 
    groups to prevent the press from thundering "conspiracy theory" 
    needs to compile a graphical presentation for the monkeys. 

        good luck trying to deliver the message to joe couch potato. 
    the controlled media networks would never sell you time.

        It is not so much a conspiracy as it is separate, or even UN, 
    groups, working for their own interests --who has the stick?--  

        Unfortunately, too many of them have overlapped by their common 
    need for a common army, a common taxation system (obviously not 
    balanced by equity) and the right to non-representative taxation 
    after they destroy freedom of speech/privacy and take away the 
    hardware.  worse than middle period Marx utopian liberated 
    socialism!  

        The UN's _printed_ statement of the conclusion of the wealth 
    distribution was a UN tax authority to redistribute the 
    wealth.... 

        What intrigues me the most is that even the very rich can not
    survive in the cesspool they will create.  there will be no 
    distinguished caste, no educated caste, etc. You will see the 
    attitude with just barely educated type administrators who will say: 
    "gifted?" Or, she can fend for herself, and eventually just sending 
    the gifted child off to the vegatable farm.  

        Despite all the utopian talk about social order, politically 
    correct unisex, socialism will never deliver enough exceptional 
    individuals to be able to povide all the pyschologists and social 
    workers they envision.

        Obviously, the fact the white man is probably less than 15% of 
    the total population and has over 80% of the industrial wealth tells 
    you where it starts.  The UN is talking about master agricultual 
    product control warehousing and distribution.

        If 20% of the population is well fed, does that include the US, 
    Canada, Russia (that's a joke), and the grain producing areas of the 
    world?   or will the white man be just part of the rest --hungry?
