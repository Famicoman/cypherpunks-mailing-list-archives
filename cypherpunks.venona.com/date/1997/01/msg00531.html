A couple points:

* The 1st Amendment does protect some lies. If I say "Jim Choate is a
Venusian albatross," the statement is probably (?) a lie, but I doubt
you'll prevail in a libel suit. What damages do you have? That's the key,
I believe -- the statement has to lower you in the opinion of others.

* Many 1st Amendment experts don't believe in the legal concept of libel. 
It is, they say, a rich man's game -- if I'm libeled by the NYT, I'm
probably not going t be able to sue them, but Donald Trump can. Moreover,
if I don't have the resources to sue but the statement is libelous, it
creates a *presumption* in the minds of the readers that the article is
certainly true. (If it were not, I would have sued, right?) 

* The concept you may be searching for is consensual speech, which I
believe a society should tolerate. Libelous speech isn't consensual,
though obscenity is.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; It has been asserted by at least one member that the 1st Amendment protects
&gt; libelous or other defamatory speech. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is hokem. The 1st most certainly does not protect lies in any form. It
&gt; protects opinion, this is distinctly different then stating a untruth about
&gt; some party or distribution of material with the attributation to them
&gt; without their permission.
&gt; 
&gt; No civilized society can exist that permits lies and other defamations of
&gt; character and expect to survive for any length of time. Simply for no other
&gt; reason than contracts and other such instruments would not be worth the
&gt; paper they were printed on. Let alone any laws or other issuances from the
&gt; government itself.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 				ARTICLE I. 
&gt;  
&gt; 	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
&gt; or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
&gt; speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
&gt; and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Where in there do you see a right to lie, cheat, or steal? If it did, it
&gt; would be a lie because it would not protect the very freedom it says it is.
