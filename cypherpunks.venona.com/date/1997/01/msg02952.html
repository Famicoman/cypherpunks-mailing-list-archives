&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It has been asserted by at least one member that the 1st Amendment protects
&gt; &gt; libelous or other defamatory speech. 
&gt; 
&gt; [I would appreciate if people with better knowledge of law correct me]
&gt; 
&gt; I doubt that anyone made this assertion. What Greg Broiles and Dr.
&gt; Grubor asserted was that because of the first amendment, the government
&gt; can not initiate an action in a libel case. Which means that libel is
&gt; not a crime. There may be some old statutes that declare libel a crime, 
&gt; as Greg noted, but they are not enforceable because of the first amendment.
&gt; 
&gt; Suits can be brought by private individuals though.
&gt; 
&gt; The government, even if it is defamed, cannot sue a private person 
&gt; for libel. For example, I can say that Congress regularly molests
&gt; small children, and they will not be able to do anything about me.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is hokem. The 1st most certainly does not protect lies in any form. It
&gt;                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; &gt; protects opinion, this is distinctly different then stating a untruth about
&gt; &gt; some party or distribution of material with the attributation to them
&gt; &gt; without their permission.
&gt; 
&gt; Not exactly. 
&gt; 
&gt; I can lie as much as I want about the government. No one would be
&gt; able to prosecute me. These particular lies are protected, contrary
&gt; to what you state.
&gt; 
&gt; The law does not protect ALL opinions, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; No civilized society can exist that permits lies and other defamations of
&gt; &gt; character and expect to survive for any length of time. Simply for no other
&gt; &gt; reason than contracts and other such instruments would not be worth the
&gt; &gt; paper they were printed on. Let alone any laws or other issuances from the
&gt; &gt; government itself.
&gt; 
&gt; You are mixing in totally unrelated things, Jim. Enforcement of contracts
&gt; has nothing to do with freedom of speech. For example, if you borrow $100
&gt; from me and fail to return your debt in time, this is an issue of contract
&gt; law and not of free speech.
&gt; 
&gt; Contract law is not about speech, it is about promises.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 				ARTICLE I. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
&gt; &gt; or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
&gt; &gt; speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
&gt; &gt; and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Where in there do you see a right to lie, cheat, or steal? If it did, it
&gt; &gt; would be a lie because it would not protect the very freedom it says it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think that all rights should be found in the first amendment?
&gt; What does the right to steal have to do with what we are talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest reading "The Fourth Estate and the Constitution: Freedom
&gt; of the Press in America", by Lucas a Powe, Jr.
&gt; 
&gt; As for stealing and cheating in contracts, read any textbook on business
&gt; law for business students. It is very useful to read this stuff, by the
&gt; way.
&gt; 
&gt; Not that these books give one a complete picture on law, but they
&gt; are very informative.
&gt; 
&gt; 	- Igor.
&gt; 

Most business Law is covered by the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code)

And business Law really has nothing to do with libel, which is just a
tort.
