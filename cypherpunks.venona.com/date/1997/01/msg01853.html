&gt;I was distracted a bit but I believe I heard on NPR news this morning that
&gt;Colorado Guv. Roy Roemer showed up at an airport sans id and had a moment
&gt;of difficulty getting on his flight.  Roemer solved the problem by showing
&gt;the Federal Permission-To-Fly checker a picture of himself in a recent
&gt;newspaper.

&gt;I thought the ill-defined (or ill-described) rules required presentation
&gt;of a _government_ picture I.D.  Since when is a newspaper photo a
&gt;government picture I.D.?  

No, they don't, though the airlines like you to think that
since it simplifies their life and it's something they can tell
$5/hour bag checkers as well as higher-paid gate agents.
There is no national rule that applies to everybody requiring it;
each airline apparently has to negotiate with the FAA to make sure
they're doing a "reasonable" job of identifying their passengers.
The airline is free to make whatever rules they want.

On United, I normally use my employee ID and the credit card I use
to buy the electronic-ticket, which verifies reasonably well that
I'm the person the ticket was bought for (by the people who
told the airline they're my employer's travel agents.)

If the _government_ required _you_ to have government ID,
there'd be serious Constitutional problems with it;
regulating interstate commerce and air traffic safety by
forcing the airlines to do something they'd kind of like
to do anyway doesn't have the same problems, even though it's
almost _more_ offensive to a free society.
