&gt;&gt;If anyone tried to set up such a market and a price went out
&gt;&gt;on any of the heads of state fantasized about Mr Bell would be 
&gt;&gt;dead as a doornail in a week.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;So you're saying that the system would work.  Mr. bell would be targeted, a
&gt;price on his head, for starting that very system.  Mr. Bell would be a
&gt;martyr, his system being proven by his own death.  It would be some varient
&gt;of his idea that would be used to kill him, a bounty.

Exactly correct.   I will be killed by AP, my own invention. (however, I 
will be killed for merely DESCRIBING it, not only if I started the first 
instance of it.)   Before I'd published the first part of AP, I knew and 
accepted what was going to happen.  See AP part 7, at the end, quoted here:




"Awe, that a system could be produced by a handful of people that 
would rid the world of the scourge of war, nuclear weapons, governments, and 
taxes.  Astonishment, at my realization that once started, it would cover 
the entire globe inexorably, erasing dictatorships both fascistic and 
communistic, monarchies, and even so-called "democracies," which as a 
general rule today are really just the facade of government by the special 
interests.  Joy, that it would eliminate all war, and force the dismantling 
not only of all nuclear weapons, but also all militaries, making them not 
merely redundant but also considered universally dangerous, leaving their 
"owners" no choice but to dismantle them, and in fact no reason to KEEP them!"

"Terror, too, because this system may just change almost EVERYTHING how we 
think about our current society, and even more for myself personally, the 
knowledge that there may some day be a large body of wealthy people who are 
thrown off their current positions of control of the world's governments, 
and the very-real possibility that they may look for a "villain" to blame 
for their downfall.  They will find one, in me, and at that time they will 
have the money and (thanks to me, at least partially) the means to see their 
revenge.  But I would not have published this essay if I had been unwilling 
to accept the risk."
