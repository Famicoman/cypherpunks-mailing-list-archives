                    INTRODUCTION TO M-NET
==============================================================

"I would rather benefit from 1 % of 100 people’s effort than
benefit from 100% of my own". The words of John Paul Getty.

M-Net, founded by Ed Brinskely, offers the average American
the tools and education they need to:
  
1. Reduce their telephone bills with simple innovative system
of Call-back, and  
  
2. To increase their income with a solid home based business.

NO SPECIAL SKILLS are required to be successful with the M-Net
Program.

We firmly believe that the vast majority of people do not want
a "hand out," but merely a "helping hand" and that is the
mission of M-Net. If you are looking for sound, time tested
advice to help you take control of your finances and runaway
debt, combined with a solid home business income opportunity,
and are not afraid of a little honest hard work, then you owe
it to yourself to learn all you can about the M-Net program.  
  
Unlike "get-rich-quick" schemes, a legitimate program requires
an investment of your time and resources in order to succeed.
Let's face it, hard work, dedication, commitment and persistence
are what built this country and made people wealthy in the
process. And the M-Net program is no different.  

However, M-Net offers one distinct advantage over many other
opportunities  available today. M-Net saves your business money
on your communication needs. 

Other opportunities require you to invest money which you may
not have.  
  
M-Net offers and teaches you teaches you sound financial
principles, strategies and techniques to help you free up the
resources it takes to achieve success! 

M-Net will also show you how to get onto the Internet with
minimal cost so solving two of the entrepreneur's largest
business expenses, advertising and telephone costs.  

The M-Net program offers a unique pay plan that rewards you with
a $25 commission on all your first level subscribers and pays you
a total of 12.5% through 10 levels on everyone's telephone bill!
You can easily qualify for commissions on all 10 levels by simply
sponsoring just one person... just one.  
  
M-Net furnishes you with all the tools necessary to finance this
exciting, home business opportunity's quick growth, enabling you
to develop a substantial monthly income for you and your family.
You'll receive the education, promotional materials, and support
while you provide the desire, dedication, hard work and
perseverance. And you don't even need a computer to succeed with 
the M-Net program either. A substantial income can be built by
ANYONE simply by telling their friends! After all they will want
to save money as well!!

With an incredible pay plan and proven income producing system
(along with a little simple hard work), you will succeed in
developing the extra income to take that extra hoiday you wanted
or to help pay off that morgage you have.
  
Please feel free to call the M-Net office at (852) 2868 4198
anytime with questions, comments, or suggestions. The doors are
always open and a voice mail system is available 24 hours a day
to take your calls.

Some Statistics:

¨ 1/3 of all produce in America was shifted through a Multi-
Level Marketing Program in 1995.
 
¨ There are 8,000 Multi-Level-Marketing Companies Worldwide.
 
¨ A MLM Company opened this year in China. They had 23,000 new
customers in 2 weeks
 
¨ Telecommunications is the third largest Industry worldwide,
it is also the fastest growing.
 
My Point:

¨ Multi-Level-Marketing is the ultimate way to market a product.
Three simple reasons:

I.   The Consultant benefits from commissions, no investment,
minimal work, a rewarding experience.
II.  The user benefits from reduced prices, no middle men.
III. The Producer benefits from reduced distribution costs,
direct links with consumer needs
 
Benefits to you the consultant:

All customer Service and Support is taken care of by M-Net and
their home company MTC. As an M-net Consultant you are paid to 
‘spread the word’.

The limits to your earnings are unknown and they are residual.
You carry on been paid even after you retire from the program.
 
You participate in a unique set of products. M-Net can offer
you a complete telemanagement system. i.e. Callback services,
Travel Cards, Fully Itemised billing, and other more technical
services such as; conference calls, Free phone lines, Fax on
Demand, Autocall and Air freight Services.

¨ No other Telephone Callback Company can do this.

You receive the lowest rates ALL round the world. M-Net, unlike
any other company, offers you discount services from Every
Country to Every Country Worldwide.

¨ Examples are calling; your Children at School, from a hotel
you might be staying at, or just calling your family abroad.

Requirements from you:

M-Net is a non-profit service to supply you with all the
information you need to understand the Telephone Industry and
products M-Net provide. There is a minimal introduction fee
of US$99.99  to cover these costs, but by the end of the first
month you would have made back the initial investment either
with the savings on your Bill or through just connecting 5 
people to M-Net's service. Free connection to the network is
also included when subscribing as an associate.

As time goes by and the money starts to come in, you will
want to spend more time on this project, anything up to 1
hour a week is all it takes. A simple guide as to how much
time is required is ‘the more time you invest the greater
your return on investment’.

   ======================================================
                   The aim of the Concept.
   ======================================================

The aim is not to make a million in one month.  What M-Net
are offering is a constant growing income every month. The
aim is not to sell as many Callback systems as quickly as
possible either. M-Net are saying Callback is, already, a
sold product. Everyone knows it saves you money. M-Net are
offering a way to make money out of Callback. Just because
it is the cheapest has little to do with it. You can sell
a Callback a hundred times but won’t get everybody using it.

M-net are saying, by becoming an Associate, you most likely
will use the service for your own benefit (its free to join
after all). Added to that as a Associate, you will ensure you,
that you yourself, get maximum benefit out of using the system.

So, you are an Associate first and a user second (you do not
have to use it). I would now like to offer an example; 

  ======================================================
                  The Twelve Year Plan.
  ======================================================

You find just one person who wants to use the service in
one year, i.e. a long time. During the following year both
you and he find one person each. You now have four people
using the system. In the third year all four of you find
one person, you have eight in your group. Year four and it
doubles again, 16 and again in the fifth year to 32, 64,
128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 and finally at the end of the
twelfth year 4,096. 

What you will find is, depending on how much time people
are willing to invest, some people will find up to 20
people a year while others will be comfortable with only
one a year.

Speeding This Up.

Taking this example further; the next stage is to speed
up this progress of multiplication. There are two easy
ways to do this.

1.      Shorten the Time. instead of 1 person every year
how about one person every month. This gives you an income
of over US$3,000 a month within a year. How this happens
I will explain later.

2.      Increase the number of Sponsorships. Instead of
just one person a year or month, why not 3 or 5. This can
be demonstrated by taking the pattern of 2,4,8,16,32,64 and
so on and doing it with three people instead of one. 1,3,9,
27,81,243 and so on...Or even better with 5. 1,5,25,125,625.
The Multiplication factor is important and akes the ultimate
difference.

How Does This Fit In With M-Net ?

The Commission Pay Plan is, like the system itself, as simple
as possible.

There are three areas.

You receive a commission of 1% on anybody and everybody's
telephone bill on 10 levels of your group or organization.
On the third level you recieve a bonus  commission of 2.5%
extra.

Your customers will also recieve a commission as a customer
if they introduce anyone to the system. They will recieve 0.5%
on 10 levels of a potential organzation that you may
inadvertently build up for them.

There is a pay out of $25 on each new member. $5 is given to
the Associate who accepts the subscription and $20 for the
customer who referred that new member. If you are the
Associate and the referring member i.e. the new member is
your introduction then you recieve the full $25.

So!!

Levels    # of Associates Commission      Monthly Earnings
You           0               0               0
1             4               1%              US$ 4.00
2             13              1%              US$ 13.00
3             40              3.5%            US$ 14.00
4             121             1%              US$ 121.00
5             364             1%              US$ 364.00
6             1,093           1%              US$ 1,093.00
7             3,280           1%              US$ 3,280.00
8             9,841           1%              US$ 9,841.00
9             29,524          1%              US$ 29,524.00
10            88,573          1%              US$ 88,573.00

This assumes an average of $100 is spent per member and every
Assoicate has the ability to find three further Associates.
This does not allow for the many people who would just become
customers, thereby increasing thse figures.

This is a cumulative calculation

       ===============================================
                    How To Sponsor!
       ===============================================

Back to first principals again. M-Net know and do not expect
anyone to be able to reach these magic figures just like that.
No one is sent out to ‘spread the word’ on their own.
Sponsoring is about support and passing on information. Like
Chinese whispers but ensuring the message is not altered. It
is M-Net job to ensure the message remains the same, let them
worry about this. That is what their complete support and back
up service to their associates is for.

Sponsoring is about keeping it simple, no one is expected to
get involved in Telecommunications, there is no need to. Each
person can take technical side of the business as far as they
want to, it is up to them. Each person just uses the product
themselves or at least knows how to use it even if they do not
use it.

The easiest way, as in any business, to sponsor is to get
someone else to do it. So only involve people who are prepared
to sponsor others, Only involve small numbers i.e. 3 or 5. The
returns are greater this way and the input by you less.

The Challenge is; Do you know 3 people who spend as little as
US$100 a month on their phone bill? Do these people know 3
people who spend US$100 a month? and so on. These are your
customers.

We in Hong Kong as M-Net principal office here, provide a full
support service. This includes a telephone service to answer
any questions. Twice weekly meetings for Assoicates to come
and introduce new Associates and to learn of new developments
with in M-Net, and a Bi-Weekly News Bulletin is sent out to
keep every one updated.

The purpose of these services are threefold:

1.      To encourage maximum communication between M-Net and
        its users,
2.      To ensure the continued growth of M-Net
3.      To provide Educational Material on how to create a
        MLM business with minimum input.

    ==================================================
                         Summary
   ===================================================

With this huge support network behind you, you should not only
be encouraged but also receive a healthy regular income only a
few months after you join. You now have a description of the
philosophy of MLM, and an example with some notes on how to go
about it. I would strongly recommend you come to a meeting and
find out more. MLM is NOT a hidden catch business, it is a
very viable spare time occupation, which more than adequately
rewards you.

To get started, simply send in a completed form and start
saving  money straight away.

                 HOW TO SAVE MONEY WITH M-NET
                          USER GUIDE

      ==================================================

Fact: In 1994, the residents of Hong Kong spent over
1,200,000,000  minutes calling the rest of the World.

                    What is Callback?

Callback is an innovative system designed specifically to
cut the cost of your International telephone bill. It’s
formula is simple.To call from any country worldwide you
call a computer in the USA and that computer supplies you
with a US dial tone.  You are now paying US prices (the
cheapest in the world) and bypassing the big costs of local
telephone companies !

                    To Use Callback 

Dial 001, 1, and then your passport access number (10 digit 
number given to you by M-Net). You can program this number
into your phone’s memory.  
 
· When you hear the first of three short rings, hang up.
Your phone will ring in 2-5 seconds. This is the computer
in the USA ‘calling you back’.
 
¸ Pick up the phone, listen for the US dial tone, and then
(if you are calling the USA) dial the number of the person
you are calling. When calling a country other than the USA,
dial 011, followed by the Country Code, Area Code and then
telephone number.
 
It really is that simple!

Mis-dials and Multiple Calls

If you are making multiple calls or you mis-dial the number
you wanted, you don’t have to repeat this process.  When the
first call is completed, and the other party has hung up,
press the # key on your phone, and the computer will again
provide you with a dial tone, then just dial again.

Autodialers

An Autodialer is available, this small device detects when
you are dialing an IDD number, it then automatically routes
the number for you through the MTC system. Giving you trouble
free IDD calling.

Speed Dial

To make life even  easier, you can also preprogram up to 99
of your friends’, clients’, telephone numbers to be accessed
by dialing only 3 numbers!


To Use

Use Callback to get the US dial tone.
