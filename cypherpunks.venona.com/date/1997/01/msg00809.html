&gt; In light of this post I have decided to make the spam-list moderated. 

Trying to cover up the truth again Chris, huh?

&gt; I
&gt; will not tolerate this sort of behaviour in a private forum. 

Hey, it was J.D. Falk that started the whole thing with a loaded
defame.bot.  All I did was respond to a Freedom-Knights mailing list
article which happened to have your list in it.

&gt; This is not a
&gt; free for all newsgroup nor is it a soapbox for you to spout deragatory
&gt; views and opinions. It is a technical forum which will be working under
&gt; the ageis of the IETF. 
&gt; 

As I said, J.D. Falk started the whole thing with his defamatory
prose about "Continued harassment by Grubor."  It was his fault, and
nobody's at this end.

&gt; If you have something productive to contribute I encourage your offical
&gt; subscription to the mailing list. Please limit your comments to those of a
&gt; technical nature dealing with the matter at hand.
&gt; 

The recognition that most every problem person is of a homosexual
nature is definitely a usenet body-politic phenomenon, which will
be documented and verified with whatever means that become necessary.

J.D. Falk Started the whole thing, and there is no way you can
get around that.  Go deal with the cypherpunks.

I have already talked to Falk's boss and Lawyer about him, and I
plan on seeing him in Court.  That shit that he publishes is not
going to last very much longer.

Over half of the problem people on usenet are Faggots, and that fact
is going to be made well known.  I want the faggot cocksucker on the
witness stand, and nothing less.

cheers,

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now this is a further example of just how much these homosexuals have

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don't worry J.D., I misplaced the file on you and that is the reason
&gt; &gt; why we have not filed the Lawsuit against you and CAIS yet, but
&gt; &gt; believe you me, we WILL be down to the D.C. area and file that Lawsuit
&gt; &gt; against you.  I have already spoken to your Lawyer, and this shit is
&gt; &gt; the last straw.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A further example of how the PROBLEM people on UseNet administration
&gt; &gt; always turn out to be the GAY crowd.  This recently discovered

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, the way i have been looking at things is that its going to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; impossible to eliminate all spam. Boycotts can be routed around,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; And the secondary routes get blocked, and get injunctions against the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; spammers, and so on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; payment
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems for mail seems to be unweildy at the present time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On the contrary, having advertisers paying for email is already working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with juno and hotmail and usa.net.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You know, this is what I have been saying for years.  Spammers will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also PAY to spam UseNet, and we could finance the whole InterNet(tm)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for FREE if we could just get rid of people like Chris Lewis and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Chris Rapier.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We WANT MORE SPAMmers on the UseNet, because we can start charging
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;them MONEY as their ISPs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Filtration isn't perfect. Before a spammer can be blocked they have to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spam... Modifying the headers will circumvent filters as well and well...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you all know the shortcomings.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The big problem with filters is that it adds support to spammer's arguments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that they're not the problem, that people who really don't want spam can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; avoid it (even as they're working to make that harder).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I dislike filters because they carry the distinct possibility of making
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things worse, of establishing a basis for spam. And filters don't hurt the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; spammers because they don't *care*. They'll just send more spam to the folks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who aren't filtering. It doesn't cost any more, and if they charge for 0.1%
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; response from a hundred thousand users they'll just charge for 0.01% from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; million...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Spammers PAY money to SPAM, and every good ISP should charge the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;SPAMmers at their end.  Then the whole Internet could be FREE for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;most all users.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;These guys like Chris Lewis who cancel SPAM and Chris Rapier who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tries to create "lists" of people, are both seriously harming the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proper economic development of the InterNet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The e-mail program that does not also contain newsgroups in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;header is a NO NO.  ALL traffic must be routed out of e-mail and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into UseNet, but NOT vice-versa.
