&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have the utmost confidence  in Sandy and his efforts to revive the

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I have all the confidence in the world in William Bennett,
&gt; &gt; &gt; George Bush, and all their wonderful helpers in helping with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Boys and Girls Clubs of Southern California.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not re-elect Hitler?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One knows one has come up with a potent weapon against one's enemies when
&gt; &gt; they begin to panic visibly like this. The smell of fear is in the air.
&gt; 
&gt; Fear?  What fear?  I had a long and productive life before I subscribed
&gt; here, and what with 1,000 or so programming projects awaiting me (and
&gt; most other competent programmers), I certainly won't be wasting time
&gt; bemoaning the fact that Sandy Sandfort "won" here, any more than I
&gt; bemoan the fact that most wars anywhere are won by the bad guys.

Uh, Mr. Thorn, you already have wasted time in exactly that way.

&gt; &gt; The question is, will the ultimate internet trump card of a distractor
&gt; &gt; (Reference Godwin's law) divert the issue and save poor Mr. Thorn from a
&gt; &gt; policy which is certainly going to be a devastating impact on his public
&gt; &gt; exposure from here on out?
&gt; 
&gt; I'll tell you something else. If I have an opportunity to contribute to
&gt; a project that can fight censorship of this kind, I will do so eagerly.

Calling the moderation plan on the table "censorship" is quite a stretch.
I'm sure it serves your rhetorical purposes, but other than that it is
merely hot air.

&gt; OTOH, I have no "tentacles", nor will I ever have such things.  I am not
&gt; a communications, security, O/S, or other such kind of programmer/person,
&gt; and I will not get into those types of applications short of physically
&gt; saving my life.  In other words, if Sandfort/Gilmore cuts me off in the
&gt; long run, it's doubtful you'd hear from me again unless something is
&gt; forwarded from Freedom-Knights, and even that is doubtful.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It does amuse me that George Bush and William Bennett are thrown out
&gt; &gt; for fear mongering purposes before Godwin's law is invoked.
&gt; 
&gt; One would think you would understand the principle of using examples
&gt; to illustrate a point.

When those examples are chosen in a logical and directed way to
accomplish the intended association, yes.  You, however, have failed on
both accounts here.

&gt; The very idea that those names would automatic-
&gt; ally inspire fear is amusing.

Your propaganda knowledge is sorely lacking for one who would aspire to
influence thought by invoking Hitler and Bush in consecutive sentences.  I
admire your honesty in admitting yourself that those names were poorly
chosen, however.

&gt; &gt; One would think Mr. Thorn had mistaken the list for a liberal stronghold.
&gt; 
&gt; Having read a lot of the crap put out by organizations from the KKK to
&gt; the ADL (all scumbags BTW), I no longer take the naive position that a
&gt; person is "liberal"

Seems your reading habits and choice of material have twisted your psyche
a bit beyond the point of reason.

&gt; (hence, one-dimensional) or "conservative", or any
&gt; other convenient tag.  Some people are liars, hypocrites, and assholes,
&gt; though, and I prefer to determine that by their actions rather than
&gt; their speculations.

You're batting 0 for 5.
 
&gt; &gt; Then again, no one ever accused Mr. Dale "Snake Oil" Thorn of being
&gt; &gt; afflicted with a strong writer's sense of audience).
&gt; 
&gt; You mean I don't tailor my prose to what people want to hear?

I mean you have no clue what prose is appropriate and what is not.
Selling snake oil on this list, for example.

&gt; Better yet, I don't go somewhere else where maybe I would be more
&gt; welcome with my ideas?

That you don't flaunt ideas clearly flawed to the experts in the field
would be a better example.

&gt; I'm embarrassed for you, for your lack of
&gt; imagination.  And if the "snake oil" tag refers to my ideas on
&gt; crypto software (i.e.., PGP), well, you have a long way to go
&gt; before you provide a serious mental challenge to me.

The bathroom is at the end of the hall.  It's not a long walk.
