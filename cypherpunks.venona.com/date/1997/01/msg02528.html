FUCK YOU SPAMMER



&gt;***********************************************************************
&gt;Our Research Has Indicated That The Following
&gt;Message Will Be Of Interest To You.
&gt;***********************************************************************
&gt;
&gt;Imagine what you can do with...
&gt;
&gt; UP TO $800.00 A WEEK EXTRA INCOME!
&gt; Here's How To Get Started
&gt;
&gt;      Let me tell you which companies to contact so you can start to
&gt; receive your checks. They can be $200.00, $400.00, even $800.00 per
&gt; week, depending on what you do. You can earn this excellent income
&gt; right at home. And you work only when you want to.
&gt;
&gt;      My name is Henry Summers. I investigate income opportunities
&gt; that are advertised in magazines or by mail or are listed in home work
&gt; directories and other sources.
&gt;
&gt;      Then I talk to people who are actually using these opportunities. I ask
&gt; how much money they make... and whether they enjoy the work. This helps
&gt; me direct you to the best opportunities that are available today. Ones that
&gt; people are using right now to earn all the money they want.
&gt;
&gt; Get Paid For Stuffing Envelopes.
&gt; No Fees. Nothing To Buy.
&gt;
&gt;      This easy work is very appealing, but most people do not know
&gt; how to get it. That's because so many of the envelope stuffing programs
&gt; being advertised are not what you expect. And you don't find that out
&gt; until after you send in your money.
&gt;
&gt;       Let me tell you the real facts. With true envelope stuffing...
&gt;
&gt;       * You do not need to pay any fee or buy any materials to get started.
&gt;       * You do not do any advertising or handle any orders.
&gt;       * All printing, postage, and mailing lists are supplied free by
&gt;          the companies that pay you.
&gt;       * Your pay is based entirely on how many envelopes you complete.
&gt;
&gt;      Rosie Martinez is an example of someone who earns money stuffing
&gt; envelopes. The company delivers all the materials right to her door.
&gt; She stuffs the envelopes, seals them, and applies the mailing labels
&gt; and postage stamps that are supplied. Then she gets paid for every
&gt; envelope completed.
&gt;
&gt;      Rosie says, "I'm retired, and I enjoy having something to do.
&gt;                          I usually watch television while I work. The
&gt;                          home shopping  shows are much more fun now
&gt;                          that I have money to spend."
&gt;
&gt;      If you'd like to do this kind of work, just follow the directions in
&gt; Chapter 3 of my book "Real Home Income". Or try any of the other
&gt; opportunities covered.
&gt;
&gt;      Hundreds of companies are ready to help you make money. I'll
&gt; tell you what each one has available now.
&gt;
&gt;      Choose the kind of work you like and write to the companies who
&gt; offer it. Pick any you want. You can work as an independent contractor for
&gt; as many companies as you have time for.
&gt;
&gt;      There are no qualifications to meet, so you will not be turned
&gt; down. I guarantee it. If you don't like one company or you want to make
&gt; more money, there are plenty of others you can try.
&gt;
&gt; Get Paid For Assembling Miniatures
&gt;
&gt;      Gina Walker of Texas likes to assemble miniature furniture for doll
houses.
&gt; All the necessary materials are supplied by the company that
&gt; pays her. She puts them together and sends them back to the company.
&gt;
&gt;      Everything is conveniently handled by mail and UPS. The company
&gt; sends her a nice pay check for each batch she completes.
&gt;
&gt;      Gina says: "I really like the work, and the extra money helps
&gt;                       pay my bills. I'm glad I found out about these
companies."
&gt;
&gt;      You can get paid the same way. And you don't have to make miniatures.
&gt; You can choose from many other types of work. You can sew baby
&gt; bonnets, assemble beaded jewelry, crochet doll clothes, make wooden
&gt; items, assemble stuffed animals, paint figurines, weave rattan reed,
&gt; and many more.
&gt;
&gt;     You get the names and addresses of over 50 companies that will pay
&gt;for things you make or assemble at home. No experience is required,
&gt;and it makes no difference where you live.
&gt;
&gt;     Almost all the companies supply the needed materials. Just do the
&gt;work and get paid for each batch you send back. Wouldn't you like to
&gt;get those pay checks? I'll show you how to get started fast.
&gt;
&gt;How I Made $800.00 Per Week After Losing My Job
&gt;
&gt;     I became interested in home income opportunities several years
&gt;ago when I lost my job. I sent for dozens of money making offers. Most
&gt;were totally worthless. Others did not appeal to me.
&gt;
&gt;     But circular mailing caught my interest... and it actually
&gt;worked. In just six weeks, I was making over $800.00 a week working
&gt;part time at home. It was better than my previous job. I soon paid off
&gt;my bills and bought a new car.
&gt;
&gt;     Yet that was only the beginning. As I learned more about it and
&gt;tried different things, the money poured in even faster. It made a
&gt;huge difference when I applied certain secrets that are used by the
&gt;experts. I was amazed at how profitable it could be.
&gt;
&gt;     In "Real Home Income" you'll learn how to use those secrets
&gt;yourself. I'll tell you which companies to contact to get started.
&gt;I'll show you some simple steps you can take to double your income
&gt;without doing any more work.
&gt;
&gt;      If you want, you can do all of this without handling any
&gt;orders. Your name and address does not have to appear on anything you
&gt;mail. You just mail circulars for companies and receive nice fat
&gt;checks from them.
&gt;
&gt;     With my proven methods, you can soon be earning more money than
&gt;you ever imagined. Just follow my directions, and you can start
&gt;receiving checks from the same companies I do.
&gt;
&gt;Receive One Dollar For Each Envelope You Stuff.
&gt;Envelopes Come To You Already Stamped And Addressed.
&gt;
&gt;     This easy work is advertised by over thirty- five companies. But
&gt;they require that you pay $25.00 to $45.00 to register in their
&gt;program. And then the program seldom turns out to be what you'd
&gt;expect.
&gt;
&gt;     That's where my book can help out. I describe the three kinds of
&gt;mail programs that pay one dollar per envelope. But there is only ONE
&gt;that I recommend. Not only is it more profitable overall, but you
&gt;don't have to pay any fee to do it. Not even a dollar. Read about "The
&gt;World's Best Dollar- Per- Envelope Program" in Chapter 4.
&gt;
&gt;How To Avoid Disappointment
&gt;
&gt;     So many worthless offers are commonly advertised that many
&gt;people give up before they come across a good one. That won't happen
&gt;to you when you have my book.
&gt;
&gt;     It tells you exactly how to recognize and avoid worthless
&gt;offers. The most common ripoffs are covered in detail. This knowledge
&gt; can save you a great deal of time and money.
&gt;
&gt;     You can then take advantage of the many practical, down- to-
&gt;earth opportunities that are described. Ones that enable you to start
&gt;making money fast. Even just one extra source of income can make a big
&gt;difference in your standard of living.
&gt;
&gt;Start To Earn Money In 48 Hours
&gt;
&gt;     When you get the book, look over the many excellent
&gt;opportunities. Each listing includes a brief description of what is
&gt;offered. Write to the companies you like and request an application
&gt;form. They have openings right now, and they'll be happy to get you
&gt;started.
&gt;
&gt;     You can begin to make money even faster if you choose one of the
&gt;programs or plans that the book describes in detail. I'll tell you
&gt;everything you need to know to get started. By taking a few simple
&gt;steps, you can already be making money just 48 hours after you receive
&gt;the book.
&gt;
&gt;Unlimited No Nonsense Guarantee
&gt;
&gt;    "Real Home Income" costs just $29.95 plus $3.00 for postage and
&gt;handling. I'm so confident you can make the money I've talked about
&gt;that I back it with a lifetime, money- back guarantee. If at any time
&gt;you feel the book has not helped you make all the money you want, just
&gt;send it back. I'll promptly send you a full refund of everything you
&gt;paid, including postage and tax.

&gt;possible. Please complete the order form and mail it today.

&gt;                                                           Henry Summers
&gt;
&gt;     P.S. I've recently discovered an amazingly profitable
&gt;            opportunity. One person I talked to made $20,000 in his
&gt;            first six weeks... working right at home in his spare
&gt;            time. It is not multi- level marketing. I've never seen
&gt;            anything like it before. I'l give you a toll free number
&gt;            to call so you can get started.
