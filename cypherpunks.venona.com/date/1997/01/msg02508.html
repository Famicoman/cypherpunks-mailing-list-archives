&gt; &gt; I would like to start a thread to discuss the moderation and rejection
&gt; &gt; policy.
&gt;
&gt; No doubt we all would but such threads may, without recourse to proper
&gt; moderation, all be thrown into cypherpunks-flames if Sandy believes
&gt; they will be critical of him. (prove me wrong Sandy, send this to the
&gt; moderated list).

Nope - Sandy tossed Paul's article to cypherpunks-flames, just like he
tossed a recent article pointing out that he's lying outright about his
moderation policies.

&gt; &gt; My perfectly crypto-relevant article regarding possible attacks
&gt; &gt; on human relationships with the use of forged mail and anonymous
&gt; &gt; remailers, has been tossed out (sorted) into cypherpunks-flames
&gt; &gt; mailing list.
&gt;
&gt; I don`t think I read the article (even though I subscribe to the
&gt; unmoderated list), can you forward me a copy.
&gt; As I understand it though, from other comentaries, it was junked
&gt; because it was in response to a message by Dimitri who, given that it
&gt; is Sandy that is moderating the list, is no doubt filtered by
&gt; different criteria than anyone else on the list, in my opinion a
&gt; censorous and fascist restraint as Dimitri has recently been posting
&gt; more crypto relevant material, besides which whatever the content of
&gt; his posts they should be open to review before a decision is made on
&gt; if they are to be junked or not.

Has Paul reversed his previous pro-censorship stand and decided to
learn something about crypto from people who actually know some?

&gt; &gt; Sandy also states rather plainly that crypto-relevance is not the
&gt; &gt; criterion by which he moderates this list. I question this policy.
&gt;
&gt; Yes Sandy, please enlighten us, what is the criterion you use to
&gt; moderate the list if not crypto-relevancy. I suspect an element of
&gt; self preservation and protection of the list fuhrer and diktat maker
&gt; John Gilmore (who, until the disgraceful incident with Dimitri
&gt; commanded some respect on this list).

I used to respect Gilmore until this series of incidents (unsubscribing
me, turning list moderated).  Now I only have disdain for him.

&gt; &gt; I would like to hear your opinions as to whether such policies satisfy
&gt; &gt; the current readership.
&gt;
&gt; I don`t think this is the point, John Gilmore is free to appoint
&gt; whoever he wants to moderate his list, he is free to censor all
&gt; messages which criticise him and his censorship, however, subscribers
&gt; to the list should be told they are being censored on these grounds
&gt; and not on some facade of "crypto relevancy" or another thin veil
&gt; drawn weakly over content based censorship to protect a certain class
&gt; of list members.

Quite a few people have expressed interest in re-creating an unmoderated
cypherpunks list at another site if Gilmore decided to stick to his
"moderation experiment".
