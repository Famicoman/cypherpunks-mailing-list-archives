loan balance * After paying nearly 24 years, you'll still owe over 50% of
your loan balance * You'll pay over 3 times the amount originally borrowed
before paying off your mortgage * To make matters worse, the F.D.I.C.
estimates that one out of every two mortgages are MISCALCULATED -
OVERCHARGING homeowners $8-$10 billion each and every year!
