ISPs to be hit with fees
By CNET STAFF
January 10, 1997, 6:45 p.m. PT

The cost of getting online looks like it's going up again.

Network Solutions, the InterNIC subcontractor that assigns Internet domain
names for a fee, has proposed tacking on more fees to the numeric addresses
behind those names, addresses that are now free.

For example, the domain name "cnet.com" masks a numeric Internet Protocol
address. The domain name system makes it simpler to send email or locate a
Web site by name, rather than by a number up to 12 digits long, such as
198.41.0.52.

Under Network Solutions' plan, a new nonprofit organization called the
American Registry for Internet Numbers would replace the
government-subsidized InterNIC IP group. North American ISPs would be hit
with fees ranging from $2,500 up to $20,000 for blocks of IP numbers that
they now receive for free and parcel out to their users.

The plan would not affect individual users unless the ISPs chose to pass
along the additional costs. But nonprofits, free community networks, and
others that do not charge for Internet access would have to pay. "They all
have operational fees today," said Jon Postel, head of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which oversees all three of the world's
Internet number assigning authorities, including the InterNIC IP group.
"It's just another operational expense."

It is the IANA as well as the National Science Foundation that would have
to approve Network Solutions' plan before it would go into effect.

The proposal is not clear about how the registry would spend the thousands
and possibly millions of dollars it would take in each year if the plan
goes through. The proposal did say that the executive director, chosen by
the board of trustees, would receive a salary determined by the board.

Network Solutions' representatives could not be reached for comment. But
IANA's Postel says that Net addresses must be treated like the airwaves.

"Address space is a kind of a public resource like the airwaves," he said.
"There are certain bands set aside for CB radio, but if you want to be a
powerful radio station, you have to go through a much more complicated
licensing procedure."

But unlike the airwaves, Internet address space is public resource that is
parceled out without any governmental oversight, whereas the Federal
Communications Commission oversees spectrum allocation.

Postel thinks the lack of such oversight is a good thing. "You think about
the FCC procedures and how long it takes to get a decision out of them on
anything," Postel said. "I'm not sure you'd want them involved."

Only companies and individuals capable of paying a $1,000 per year in fees
will be allowed to participate in forming American Registry's policies. By
contrast, any U.S. citizen has the right to file comments with the FCC
about communications policies.

The American Registry's five-member board of trustees would be initially
selected by Network Solutions. Future boards would in their turn be
selected by the board that Network Solutions had picked, giving the private
company an unprecedented influence over the assignment of increasingly
scarce IP numbers. The IP numbering system is reaching its limits and plans
are currently being considered to extend it.
