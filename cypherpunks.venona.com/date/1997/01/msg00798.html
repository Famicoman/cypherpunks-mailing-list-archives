Before you get too carried away by the capabilities of off the shelf
character recognition, read Phil Karn's experience trying to produce
a working DES program from the pages of Applied Cryptography.  It was
easier than writing it himself, but it was still far from a turnkey
operation.  This is from &lt;URL:
<A  HREF="http://www.qualcomm.com/people/pkarn/export/karndecl.html">http://www.qualcomm.com/people/pkarn/export/karndecl.html</A> &gt;


&gt; 5. I began by first photocopying, on a standard office photocopier, the
&gt; 18 pages containing the Triple DES source code listing from Part V of
&gt; the Book. This took about 5 minutes. Second, I scanned in the 18 sheets
&gt; on a Macintosh Quadra 610 computer system equipped with an HP ScanJet II
&gt; flatbed scanner and Omnipage Professional optical character recognition
&gt; (OCR) software. The computer, scanner, and software are all readily
&gt; available through normal consumer computer supply channels. The total
&gt; scanning process took about one and a half hours. About an hour of this
&gt; time was spent learning to use the scanning system and conducting trial
&gt; runs, as I had only used it briefly some time ago. The actual scan of the
&gt; 18 pages took about 15-20 minutes. Third, I transferred the resulting
&gt; machine-readable file from the Macintosh to my own personal computer
&gt; and brought it up under GNU EMACS, a popular and widely available text
&gt; editing program that I have used for many years. In EMACS I compared,
&gt; by eye, the scanned file displayed on my screen against the printed
&gt; listing in the Book. I began correcting the scanner's many errors, such
&gt; as mistaking the digit '0' for the letter 'O' or mistaking the vertical
&gt; bar '|' for the letter 'I'.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. After manually correcting those errors noticed through visual
&gt; comparison with the Book, I invoked the "C" language compiler on the
&gt; (partially) corrected file. The compiler immediately pointed out
&gt; additional errors I had overlooked in my visual inspection so I could
&gt; also correct them by reference to the Book. I also noticed several errors
&gt; in the listing printed in the Book. However, the programmer's intentions
&gt; were obvious from the context of each error and were easily fixed. About
&gt; fifty minutes later, I successfully compiled the file without error.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. The fourth step was to write a small test program to execute
&gt; the DES code with the test vectors given at the end of the source
&gt; code listing. This trivial program took less than 5 minutes to
&gt; write. Unfortunately, the test did not succeed, meaning that at
&gt; least one error went undetected by the compiler in either the code as
&gt; printed in the Book or as scanned. Scrutinizing the code more closely,
&gt; I quickly found another error in the printed version that was easily
&gt; corrected. However, it still did not produce correct results. After about
&gt; an hour of searching, I finally located the error in a list of numbers
&gt; in a table -- another error in the printed version. By reference to the
&gt; DES algorithm description in the first part of the Book, which includes
&gt; the correct numbers in tabular form, I found and corrected the error.
&gt; 
&gt; 8. At this point the test finally succeeded, so I knew I had a correct
&gt; program. However, to increase my confidence further I tried a few
&gt; other DES test vectors that were not included in the source code, but
&gt; were openly published by the US National Institute of Standards and
&gt; Technology (NIST). All passed. At this point it was beyond doubt that I
&gt; had a correct, working copy of the DES source code identical to that on
&gt; the Disk with all errors removed, including those printed in the Book
&gt; as well as those added by the scanning process.
&gt; 
&gt; 9. Finally, in about 40 minutes I wrote and debugged a "driver" program
&gt; analogous to that included in the Crowell declaration. This driver program
&gt; takes a sample plaintext file, encrypts it, displays the encrypted file
&gt; in hexadecimal and then decrypts it.
