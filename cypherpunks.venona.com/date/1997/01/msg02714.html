&gt;While I think it's always useful to consider unintended (or otherwise
&gt;unexpected) consequences, Gladwell's argument sent a shiver down my spine
&gt;with its shameless paternalism. This bit (from roughly the middle of his
&gt;piece) is what I found creepiest:
&gt;
&gt;"According to one recent study, somewhere between twenty and twenty-seven
&gt;per cent of the parents of four-to six-year-olds never restrict their
&gt;children's viewing hours, never decide what programs they can watch, never
&gt;change the channel when something objectionable comes on, and never forbid
&gt;the watching of certain programs. It has apparently never occurred to these
&gt;parents that television can be a bad influence, and it strains credulity to
&gt;think that the advent of the V-chip is going to wake them up. Yet their
&gt;families - mainly lower-income, ill-educated - are the very ones most in
&gt;need of protection from television violence. Here is a rearranging effect
&gt;with a vengeance: not only does the V-chip make television worse, it makes
&gt;television worse precisely for those already most vulnerable to its excesses."
&gt;
&gt;I understood Gladwell's point to be, in essence, that the V-chip will allow
&gt;TV producers to generate higher levels of morally impure content which he
&gt;fears will pollute the minds of poor children because their parents are too
&gt;stupid to protect them from the harmful content and too poor to buy new
&gt;televisions which will include V-chips.
...
What this means is, subsidized v-chip upgrades, and v-chips turned on by
default.
Now to watch the really good stuff you have to subscribe to "tv-un v-chipped"
Sorry, I couldn't resist the pot shot.
