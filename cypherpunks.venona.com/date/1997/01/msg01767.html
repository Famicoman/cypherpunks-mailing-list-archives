&gt;to the world of  Personnel computing!!!

&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&gt;This letter is being sent to you because you know that 
&gt;information is Power. You are interested in new ways of 
&gt;doing business economically and safely. You won't let 
&gt;anyone take advantage of you.
&gt;
&gt;Please read the next few paragraphs to see if our services can help you.
&gt;
&gt;We are Informational Investigations, Unlimited, a public
&gt;information company. What we do is to provide the public
&gt;with information on people and companies. Let me explain.
&gt;
&gt;Say you've lost touch with an old friend. We can find  that
&gt;person. What if that someone or a company owes you money. We
&gt;can find that person/company so you can collect. Here's  
&gt;another way IIU can help you.
&gt;
&gt;Are you buying a house? Do you think knowing what the seller
&gt;paid for the same house could help you in the negotiations?
&gt;Do you trust the real estate to give you the right tax
&gt;assessment? We can give you the taxes on your dream house
&gt;directly from yhe assessors office. No better way to be
&gt;accurate than that! 
&gt;
&gt;Are you hiring a 'nanny' or babysitter? I know from my 
&gt;experience how emotional a decision that can be. The worry,
&gt;the questions about his/her background. EASE YOUR MIND! Why
&gt;not check to see if this person was convicted of a crime. Do
&gt;they have bad credit or a DWI?
&gt;
&gt;OK? Want to see one more? Here's how we have saved landlords
&gt;money for years.
&gt;
&gt;Renting an apartment? Extending credit? Call us! We can do 
&gt;the background checking for you, saving you time and money 
&gt;in the long run. Have you ever tried to get a deadbeat out
&gt;out of your apartment for non-payment? With today's courts,
&gt;it is almost impossible. Save money NOW. Call us to do a
&gt;background on the perspective tenant BEFORE you rent to them.
&gt;A few dollars now may save you THOUSANDS later in attorney's 
&gt;fees and lost rent.
&gt;
&gt;CONVINCED? We won't belabor the point. We can provide you with
&gt;the information you need to make informed decisions quickly
&gt;and economically.
&gt;
&gt;Our fees? Simple. We charge you the cost of the search plus
&gt;$20.00. Our search fees, the amount it costs us to get your 
&gt;information, is usually $50.00 or less. Most searches are
&gt;$10.-15.00. All information is obtained legally through
&gt;public databases.
&gt;
&gt;Call us at (800) 375-5260, Monday-Friday-9AM to 5PM ET. Or
