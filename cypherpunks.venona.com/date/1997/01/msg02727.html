paul@fatmans.demon.co.uk said:
&gt; &gt; I think both of these groups are intellectually dishonest in the
&gt; &gt; extreme when it comes to telling others how this list should be
&gt; &gt; run.  I doubt any of them would permit the sort of disruptive
&gt; &gt; behavior that goes on here to go unchallenged in salons they
&gt; &gt; sponsor in their own homes or on Net lists that they themselves 
&gt; &gt; maintain.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to talk about intellectual dishonesty try the following:
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine if you will a list, the original purpose of which was
&gt; to act as a free and open forum for discussion of cryptography and 
&gt; related issues. A list which proudly proclaims in its "welcome to 
&gt; the list" message:
&gt; 
&gt; We do not seek to prevent other people from
&gt; speaking about their experiences or their opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; Now imagine that list falling into a state of content based 
&gt; censorship and censorship based on an unspoken but ever present 
&gt; class structure, then ask yourself which list you know that most 
&gt; closely matches this description, it`s a pretty revealing exercise.

The exercise reveals to me that only by ignoring the first paragraph
of your example, the part that reads "Imagine if you will a list, 
the original purpose of which was to act as a free and open forum 
for discussion of cryptography and related issues." can you make
a claim of content based censorship. The purpose of this list was
and should be discussion of cryptography and related issues. The
fact that some people choose this as a forum for personal attacks
and blathering about issues that are not even vaguely related to
the discussion of cryptography and related issues does not make it
a proper forum for such communication.

&gt; &gt; This is a voluntary list folks.  We tried incivility and that did
&gt; &gt; not work.  Right now we are experimenting with reasoned discourse
&gt; &gt; in an atmosphere of interpersonal respect and good will. 
&gt; 
&gt; For "Reasoned discourse in an atmosphere of interpersonal respect and 
&gt; good will" read "content based censorship".

For "voluntary list" read "voluntary list".

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If most list members like the change, it will continue.  If not, then we
&gt; &gt; can go back to the swill or perhaps try something else.  In the
&gt; &gt; meantime, get over it.  If you really like flames and spam, show
&gt; &gt; John and me how it really should be done.  Start another list.  
&gt; &gt; Of course squating and claim jumping appeal to the lazy a lot
&gt; &gt; more than homesteading.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the upper class of list members will 
&gt; have no dispute over the censorship and therefore the change will be 
&gt; permenant, it is a form of online ethnic cleansing whereby the lists 
&gt; clique of illuminati have taken it upon themselves to remove the 
&gt; elements of the list they feel endanger their position of superiority 
&gt; and respect, the point they have missed is that they have no 
&gt; credibility whatsoever after this incident, as well as a number of 
&gt; other such occurances and therefore are only isolating themselves 
&gt; into their own little world.

The Big Lie once again. yadda yadda yadda "Censorship!" yadda yadda
yadda "No Credibility" yadda yadda yadda ad nauseum.

&gt; 
&gt; "cypherpunks will make the networks safe for censorship"

"Idiots will make the networks require censorship"
