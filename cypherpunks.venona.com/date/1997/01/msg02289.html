&gt;&gt;This is the approach taken by PGPfone also.  If the value of the
&gt;&gt;conversations was high (&gt;$100,000?) passable voice imitation wouldn't
&gt;&gt;be that hard I suspect.
&gt;
&gt;I have long considered how easy it would be to use a sound card to modify
&gt;the human voice to match within certain tolerances the voice of another.
&gt;
&gt;There are currently on the market, phones specifically designed to modify
&gt;the voice of the user so that kids can answer as adults, women can answer as
&gt;thier own protective boyfriends, bosses can answer anonymous calls as the
&gt;secretary, etc...
&gt;
&gt;There are currently on the market keyboards that allow you to sample some
&gt;real world sound and use it as a voice in your music, (the model I saw, a
&gt;toy produced by Radio Shack, simply sped up or slowed down the sound to
&gt;achieve this.)
&gt;
&gt;I have thought, if a machine were to take the incoming voice, analize
&gt;(apologies for spelling) it to get a spectrum signature, a pattern that can
&gt;be added or subtracted from another, and could then add the difference
&gt;between that and the victims signature to the users voice, then real-time,
&gt;on-the-fly con jobs would be easy.
&gt;
&gt;The only thing that the user would be responsible for would be the accent,
&gt;and the day-to-day vocabulary of the victim.
&gt;
&gt;I told a friend about this and he confirmed that such was available if you
&gt;knew where to look.

A friend of mine, an expert on signal processing, vocei systhesis and
recognition, showed me a journal article (think it was an IEEE) in 1990 of
some university researchers who had prototyped just such a device.  Never
followed up, but it seems entirely reasonable a practicle.  In fact I'm
surprised that Hollywood hasn't latched onto this in order to dub film
stars to different languages w/o loosing their recognizable voice
characteristics.
