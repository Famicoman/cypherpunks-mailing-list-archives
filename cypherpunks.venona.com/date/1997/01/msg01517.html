&gt; You have the RIGHT to have negative

&gt;credit counselor $500 or more to do exactly what you can do for yourself?
&gt;
&gt;For less than $15, you can help yourself to better credit. We'll give you
&gt;all the tools you need and explain exactly what to do.

&gt;You've probably seen other offers or similar credit repair packages that
&gt;promise overnight results. Anyone who promises a quick overnight fix is
&gt;*lying* to you. It takes time and perseverance to fix your bad credit. 
&gt;But, it can be done!
...
&gt;Don't get ripped off and don't take bad advice that encourages you to break
&gt;the law! Our system WORKS! Our credit repair manual will show you step by
&gt;step how to do it yourself - and it's not hard to do!

&gt; We purchased a
&gt;mailing list of folks who should be interested in various products that
&gt;we produce, but mailing lists can be wrong, and we don't want to take your
&gt;time again unnecessarily.  Thanks for your help!

I understand that freedom of speech is a basic right, and I understand the
nature of public discourse which is unhindered being more valuable, even if
the signal to noise ratio is higher.
I also subscribe to the idea that in a forum where only speech is possible,
a persons use of that speech is the representation of that person.  (Not
that it never is otherwise.)
What I'm trying to get at is, when does freedom of speech in a "speech only"
environment" become soliciting?  To me, though it is only my opinion, it
seems that a telemarketer wishing to offer wares to a group on a mailing
list should get permission from the lists maintainer.  I apologize if this
is already the case, as my accusations would be pointless.
To me, it seems to be a breach of conduct for a company to use a mailing
list that is not thier own as a mass mailing technique.
Again, these are only my personal opinions.
