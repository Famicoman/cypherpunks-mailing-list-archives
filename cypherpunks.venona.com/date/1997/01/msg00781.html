Looks like we're coming to the old "irresistable force meets immovable
object" consensus, yes?

The sheeple are going to plod along slowly and resistantly towards
personal, "secure" encryption,
while the rulers would rather eat their children than give up money.

My guess is that the public (see: sheeple) is *never* going to become
technically oriented, no matter how many gizmos or crypto programs they
have and can use. Therefore, the rulers, possessing ever greater numbers
and quality of intrusive devices, will inch forward toward total control,
despite temporary advances by the sheeple.

The (perfect) example of the 1960's revolution was vastly outweighed by:

1. Decapitation of any independent leadership, i.e., assassinations.
2. Co-opting of schools, businesses, media, welfare programs et al.
3. Tremendous advances in disinformation and propaganda technology
   which has no analogy amongst the general public.

Some people think the Internet will help the average guy win back some
freedom, but the reality is that capital is still being shifted away
from the common folk to the wealthier folk, even as the Internet expands.

The sheeple have had one (unintended) weapon on their side:  The fact
that the scumbag fed agencies and their beneficiaries have been fighting
amongst themselves a lot (see: assassinations). This will instantly stop
if the sheeple become a real threat.  You won't believe how fast.

It's the dream of every elitist that they will someday be able to enjoy
a really comfortable and yet productive existence, where the non-elite
are satisfied and happy with their jobs (or are somehow being supported
without unduly burdening the elitists), and most important, are just
comfortable enough that they won't riot (or at least won't riot in the
elitist neighborhoods).  Most likely the electronic implants and drugs
(Soma, HDTV/3DTV) will alleviate most of the sheeple's unhappiness, so
as to reduce the requirement for the elitists to give any more attention
to these problems.
