&gt; &gt; The list has been disentigrating for some time since the disgusting 
&gt; &gt; incident when Dimitri was forcibly unsubscribed from the list. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm curious about the gratuitous use of the word "forcibly" by
&gt; Paul.  Does this mean Gilmore took a fire axe to the computer or
&gt; something?  Dimitri was unsubscribed.  It was done more or less
&gt; against his will.  ("More or less" because he in effect said to
&gt; John, "bet you can't stop me.")  What does "forcibly" add to this
&gt; discussion besides melodrama?  No force was required.  John had
&gt; the right and ability to pull the plug on Dimitri.  "No animals
&gt; were harmed in the making of this film."  "Force," my ass.
&gt; 
	You are disgusting cindy.

&gt; &gt; have also been a number of postings from members of the list claiming 
&gt; &gt; to understand anarchism who support censorship to "protect new 
&gt; &gt; members of the list".
&gt; 
&gt; There are various definitions of "censorship" and various flavors
&gt; of anarchism.  I'm a market anarchist, Paul is not.  Paul claims
&gt; to believe that any form of moderation is censorship.  I think
&gt; that enforcing standards of decorum on a private, voluntary list
&gt; are not censorship.  Reasonable minds may differ.  I acknowledge 

	Yes REASONABLE minds do differ from yours...

&gt; that Paul's interpretations are not without some justification.
&gt; (I just think they are incorrect in the instant case.)  Paul, on
&gt; the other hand, seems to be a True Believer.  He brooks no view
&gt; other than his own.  (Curiously hypocritical under the 
&gt; circumstrances.)
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; So, there would be no intellectual dishonesty in a country claiming 
&gt; &gt; to be a free and open society "trying out" fascism for a month or 
&gt; &gt; two? - After all it`s a private country just as this is a private 
&gt; &gt; list....
&gt; 
&gt; Paul's sophistry is showing.  Nation-states are entities that
&gt; exercise a monopoly on the use of force (real force, Paul)
&gt; within (and often without) their boundries.  Mail lists are far
&gt; more like private homes, businesses or clubs.  When you are a
&gt; guest there, you are subject to their rules of behavior.

	If it is so private, why does deja news have it
	when 'mail.cypherpunks' is searched???
	
&gt; &gt; There is a clear trend easily observable on the list whereby certain 
&gt; &gt; members postings are censored when their content is of a standard 
&gt; &gt; that, if the moderation were objective and based on content alone, 
&gt; &gt; would warrant their being sent to the censored list.
&gt; 
&gt; Several substantive examples, please.  True, nothing Bill Stewart
&gt; has posted has been sent to CP-Flames.  One guess why.  Numerous
&gt; posts by Dimitri have been posted to CP-Moderated, but many more
&gt; have not made the cut.  There are much more obvious reasons for
&gt; this than Paul's biased analysis.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; I can tell you one other thing for sure, even if the moderation 
&gt; &gt; "experiment" were to end in a month as a last ditch attempt by John 
&gt; &gt; Gilmore and Sandy Sandfort to recover some of their lost credibility 
&gt; &gt; it would be a vain and entirely unsuccesful attempt.
&gt; 
&gt; YMMV.
&gt;
