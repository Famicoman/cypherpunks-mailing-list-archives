&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My perfectly crypto-relevant article regarding possible attacks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on human relationships with the use of forged mail and anonymous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remailers, has been tossed out (sorted) into cypherpunks-flames
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mailing list.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don`t think I read the article (even though I subscribe to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; unmoderated list), can you forward me a copy.
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I understand it though, from other comentaries, it was junked
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it was in response to a message by Dimitri who, given that it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is Sandy that is moderating the list, is no doubt filtered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; different criteria than anyone else on the list, in my opinion a
&gt; &gt; &gt; censorous and fascist restraint as Dimitri has recently been posting
&gt; &gt; &gt; more crypto relevant material, besides which whatever the content of
&gt; &gt; &gt; his posts they should be open to review before a decision is made on
&gt; &gt; &gt; if they are to be junked or not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has Paul reversed his previous pro-censorship stand and decided to
&gt; &gt; learn something about crypto from people who actually know some?
&gt;
&gt; There is no change of stance needed, I happen to believe you are
&gt; knowledgable about cryptography and sometimes post worthwhile
&gt; commentary and information, however, you also post a lot of dreck and
&gt; flammable material which means I respond in kind. That does not mean
&gt; I believe you, or anyone else, should be censored.

I distinctly recall how Paul used to call for censoring me. If he's
changed his mind and really doesn't think that anyone should be censored,
it's a welcome development - even if it was brought on by the sandfart
censoring Paul.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sandy also states rather plainly that crypto-relevance is not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; criterion by which he moderates this list. I question this policy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sandy, please enlighten us, what is the criterion you use to
&gt; &gt; &gt; moderate the list if not crypto-relevancy. I suspect an element of
&gt; &gt; &gt; self preservation and protection of the list fuhrer and diktat maker
&gt; &gt; &gt; John Gilmore (who, until the disgraceful incident with Dimitri
&gt; &gt; &gt; commanded some respect on this list).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I used to respect Gilmore until this series of incidents (unsubscribing
&gt; &gt; me, turning list moderated).  Now I only have disdain for him.
&gt;
&gt; I agree entirely, Gilmore was a respected man (despite the EFF being
&gt; a corporate whore) who threw any respect and admiration others had
&gt; for him away.

I wonder what he thinks he got in exchange...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to hear your opinions as to whether such policies satisfy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the current readership.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don`t think this is the point, John Gilmore is free to appoint
&gt; &gt; &gt; whoever he wants to moderate his list, he is free to censor all
&gt; &gt; &gt; messages which criticise him and his censorship, however, subscribers
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the list should be told they are being censored on these grounds
&gt; &gt; &gt; and not on some facade of "crypto relevancy" or another thin veil
&gt; &gt; &gt; drawn weakly over content based censorship to protect a certain class
&gt; &gt; &gt; of list members.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Quite a few people have expressed interest in re-creating an unmoderated
&gt; &gt; cypherpunks list at another site if Gilmore decided to stick to his
&gt; &gt; "moderation experiment".
&gt;
&gt; I notice and appreciate the quotes around "moderation experiment",
&gt; this is, without doubt, a permenant measure to silence members of the
&gt; list who dare to offer criticism of anyone an element of {x: x a
&gt; friend or co-censor of John Gilmore}

Yes - clearly the personality of the submitter is the most important
factor in moderator's rejections, not even the content.

&gt; I do not have the resources to run such an unmoderated list but I
&gt; hope someone on this list does and is good enough to start such a
&gt; list, cypherpunks is a shell of what it once was.

I notice that the sandfart has been challenging his enemies to create
an alternative mailing list. I wonder what their contingency plan is.
Without a doubt, such a competing list would be mailbombed and flooded
with garbage by Gilmore and his entourage. What else?

&gt; Also, please note this message will be junked onto cypherpunks-flames
&gt; even though it contains no flames or flame bait because it dares to
&gt; criticise the censorship of the list (once again Sandy, I give you an
&gt; opportunity to prove me wrong).

The sandfart has proven me right already. As I said, I think we're
paying too much attention to him and his censorship, and he's just
a front for Gilmore anyway.
