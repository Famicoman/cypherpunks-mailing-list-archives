&gt; &gt; &gt; My perfectly crypto-relevant article regarding possible attacks
&gt; &gt; &gt; on human relationships with the use of forged mail and anonymous
&gt; &gt; &gt; remailers, has been tossed out (sorted) into cypherpunks-flames
&gt; &gt; &gt; mailing list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don`t think I read the article (even though I subscribe to the
&gt; &gt; unmoderated list), can you forward me a copy.
&gt; &gt; As I understand it though, from other comentaries, it was junked
&gt; &gt; because it was in response to a message by Dimitri who, given that it
&gt; &gt; is Sandy that is moderating the list, is no doubt filtered by
&gt; &gt; different criteria than anyone else on the list, in my opinion a
&gt; &gt; censorous and fascist restraint as Dimitri has recently been posting
&gt; &gt; more crypto relevant material, besides which whatever the content of
&gt; &gt; his posts they should be open to review before a decision is made on
&gt; &gt; if they are to be junked or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Has Paul reversed his previous pro-censorship stand and decided to
&gt; learn something about crypto from people who actually know some?

There is no change of stance needed, I happen to believe you are 
knowledgable about cryptography and sometimes post worthwhile 
commentary and information, however, you also post a lot of dreck and 
flammable material which means I respond in kind. That does not mean 
I believe you, or anyone else, should be censored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sandy also states rather plainly that crypto-relevance is not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; criterion by which he moderates this list. I question this policy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes Sandy, please enlighten us, what is the criterion you use to
&gt; &gt; moderate the list if not crypto-relevancy. I suspect an element of
&gt; &gt; self preservation and protection of the list fuhrer and diktat maker
&gt; &gt; John Gilmore (who, until the disgraceful incident with Dimitri
&gt; &gt; commanded some respect on this list).
&gt; 
&gt; I used to respect Gilmore until this series of incidents (unsubscribing
&gt; me, turning list moderated).  Now I only have disdain for him.

I agree entirely, Gilmore was a respected man (despite the EFF being 
a corporate whore) who threw any respect and admiration others had 
for him away.
 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to hear your opinions as to whether such policies satisfy
&gt; &gt; &gt; the current readership.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don`t think this is the point, John Gilmore is free to appoint
&gt; &gt; whoever he wants to moderate his list, he is free to censor all
&gt; &gt; messages which criticise him and his censorship, however, subscribers
&gt; &gt; to the list should be told they are being censored on these grounds
&gt; &gt; and not on some facade of "crypto relevancy" or another thin veil
&gt; &gt; drawn weakly over content based censorship to protect a certain class
&gt; &gt; of list members.
&gt; 
&gt; Quite a few people have expressed interest in re-creating an unmoderated
&gt; cypherpunks list at another site if Gilmore decided to stick to his
&gt; "moderation experiment".

I notice and appreciate the quotes around "moderation experiment", 
this is, without doubt, a permenant measure to silence members of the 
list who dare to offer criticism of anyone an element of {x: x a 
friend or co-censor of John Gilmore}

I do not have the resources to run such an unmoderated list but I 
hope someone on this list does and is good enough to start such a 
list, cypherpunks is a shell of what it once was. 

Also, please note this message will be junked onto cypherpunks-flames 
even though it contains no flames or flame bait because it dares to 
criticise the censorship of the list (once again Sandy, I give you an 
opportunity to prove me wrong).
