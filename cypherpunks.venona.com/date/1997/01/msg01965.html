as i have writ before, the sources i have read say that 
digits of the transcendentals are THOUGHT to be uniformly
and 'randomly' distributed --- in quotes because there are
many criteria for randomness and i don't mean to imply a 
specific one.  however, this supposision is no stronger
than a conjecture.  has not been proven, AFAIK.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I want to use a one time pad pased crypto system. I understand that the
&gt;&gt; &gt; randomness of the pad genorator is key to security(other than lossing the
&gt;&gt; &gt; keys). What I want to know is if I use a psuedo-RNG that maybe repeats
its
&gt;&gt; &gt; self every 1000 characters and use it to only encrypt messagase that are
&gt;&gt; &gt; 100's of charaters long, will this be a major security risk? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid you've fallen into one of the standard traps.  A PRNG can *not*
&gt;&gt; make a OTP no matter how you use it.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The total amount of entropy in a PRNG is the amount of entropy in the seed 
&gt;&gt; you use to key it.  All the other bits are directly derived from that seed.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; A true OTP is completely secure from an information-theory point of view
&gt;&gt; because every byte has a full eight bits of entropy.  A PRNG can never
&gt;&gt; have this.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Having said all this, it is possible to make a good cipher from a PRNG.
&gt;&gt; RC4, for example, is exactly that and the variable sized key is the
&gt;&gt; seed for the PRNG.  It is however very difficult to come up with a
&gt;&gt; good algorithm for that cryptographically sound PRNG and you would
&gt;&gt; be much further ahead to use an existing one rather that trying to
&gt;&gt; roll your own.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Say I create a 1 million character one time pad that passes all of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; randomness tests. It is "truely random". I place it on two computers. Now
&gt;&gt; &gt; when these two computers want to send email computer "A" grabs a chunk
of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; one time pad  starting at a random point and encrypts it. It labels
the email
&gt;&gt; &gt; with the random starting point and sends it to "B". There "B" moves to
the
&gt;&gt; &gt; random point and begins decryption. During to process both computers mark
&gt;&gt; &gt; that section of the OTP used so that they don't retransmit with it. I
realize
&gt;&gt; &gt; this has a limited amount of messages before it is used up. But would
this be
&gt;&gt; &gt; secure? Any suggestions, complaints, big gapping holes I missed? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I don't see anything wrong as such, but there is nothing to be gained
either.
&gt;&gt; If your random data is real OTP material there is no need to skip to a
random
&gt;&gt; byte within it, just start at the beginning and use it in sequence.  If
your random
&gt;&gt; data is the output of a PRNG like the above then random starting point
doesn't
&gt;&gt; buy you much additional security because the entire set of keying
material can
&gt;&gt; be recreated from the seed.  It may increase the work-factor of
searching for
&gt;&gt; the key, but it also imposes the practical problem of keeping all that
keying
&gt;&gt; material secure.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; More importantly don't confuse statistically random with cryptographically
&gt;&gt; random.  Just because a bunch of bits passes all the randomness test
&gt;&gt; you can think of doesn't mean it contains 100% entropy.  Consider the
&gt;&gt; digits of an irrational number like sqrt(2) or pi, the digits appear
statistically
&gt;&gt; random but they can be recreated from just a tiny bit of knowledge.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; A good litmus test is to ask yourself if there is any way you can
&gt;&gt; reproduce those bits.  If there is, they aren't a one time pad.
&gt;&gt; (Of course even if you can't it doesn't mean they are good. :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; regards,
&gt;&gt; -Blake
