Oh, so you're just going to fix up your program a little bit, and
immediately your private key system will turn into a public key system?
Are you sure you read A.C. and didn't just look at the pictures?

I'm beginning to see this &lt;insert long acronym here&gt; as being a
variation on XOR.

The amazing shrinking key... pretty soon we'll have 1 bit keys, and
they'll have to be registered with this company for ITAR compliance. ;)

&gt; methods are not too comparable to PKCS methods. What I was referring to when
&gt; I said IMDMP is more advanced than RSA, etc. is the actual encryption
&gt; procedure itself, not the way keys are secured. Again, irrashional claims

Says who?  You?  Hahahahahaha.

&gt; were not intended at all. The amount of analytical research invested in IMDMP
&gt; was thought to be sufficient.

So a cryptosystem that's been in existence for an entire eleven days (you
said it was created January 1, 1997) has had "sufficient" "analytical 
research invested"?  My, you ARE clueless.

&gt; believe that the celebrated creator(s) of Blowfish, IDEA, etc. had to go
&gt; through all of this ritualistic screening complexity too. (Please do correct
&gt; me if I am wrong.)

You're right, they didn't.  It's because they published code first and
then asked for review.  They didn't try to make a profit on an operating
system-specific piece of pre-compiled code before explaining the system
and giving full details.

&gt; (For the record: DataET Research's promotional agent has been fired.)

Then why are you still posting?

&gt; UDCMV20.ZIP is currently unavailable on the web site as the software is
&gt; undergoing additional security modifications.

You mean you're changing XOR to AND?

&gt; structuring. Sub-algorithms of IMDMP are basically additional applications of
&gt; one or more of the aforesaid techniques.

SUB encrypt1 'Super secret encryption routine

SHARED text_to_encrypt$

text_to_encrypt$ = "[SECRET]" + text_to_encrypt$ + "[SECRET]"

END SUB

(Will you sue me for copyright infringement now?  I bet it looks identical
to your code -- and in the same language, too.)
