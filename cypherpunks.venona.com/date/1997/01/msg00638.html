&gt;Update on Bugging Devices
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;0.902 - 0.928 ghz - Popular Commercial FH/DS Devices
&gt;1.710 - 1.755 ghz - DEA Audio/Video Bugs (over 1400 bugs purchased in 1995)
&gt;1.710 - 1.755 ghz - DOJ Audio/Video Bugs (.25 to .50 watts)
&gt;1.710 - 1.850 ghz - Treasury Video Surveillance Systems
&gt;2.400 - 2.484 ghz - Popular Commercial FH/DS Devices
&gt;4.635 - 4.660 ghz - Treasury Video Surveillance Systems
&gt;
&gt;Most recently purchased gvt microwave surveillance gear seems to be running
&gt;between 900mhz to 5ghz, with a few systems operating on the 7/8 ghz bands.
&gt;
&gt;Also, keep in mind that the pros love to use ultra low power devices which
&gt;use the power lines as the transmission medium/antenna (9khz to 300 mhz).
&gt;Devices typically operate below 10mw, often below 1mw. The devices
&gt;typically use Wide FM and use voice inversion encryption... VERY easy to
&gt;demodulate.
&gt;
&gt;Note: According to a recently obtained DOJ surveillance training manual:
&gt;
&gt;"The typical range for the 28 ghz devices is six miles, the typical range
&gt;of the 2.4 ghz is thirty miles, and the typical range for the 1.7ghz  is 44
&gt;miles."
&gt;
&gt;"... frequency modulated applications should operate below 3 ghz to take
&gt;advantage of the favorable frequency propagation characteristics of that
&gt;part of the spectrum."
&gt;
&gt;"...Frequency Hopping and Direct Sequence Devices spead spectrum devices
&gt;should operate above 1.5 ghz, this will prevent the emissions from being
&gt;detected by electronic countermeasures."
&gt;
&gt;The most popular surveillance reciever used covers 9khz (for CC/VLF) up to
&gt;9ghz, so be sure to cover AT LEAST those bands.
&gt;
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;All TSCM people have heard about AID devices, but few know the actual freq
&gt;they use, or what they look like.
&gt;
&gt;The devices are VERY popular with the law enforcement crowd, private
&gt;investigators and corporate security types. The equipment is VERY overpriced,
&gt;and the fairly easy to detect.
&gt;
&gt;AID bills itself as "The World's Largest Manufacturer of Electronic
&gt;Intelligence Equipment and Specialized Protective Systems"
&gt;
&gt;AID was founded in 1970, and was sold in 92/93 to Westinghouse (Westinghouse is
&gt;currently selling TONS of equipment to the DEA and State dept)
&gt;
&gt;AID - Westinghouse/Audio Intelligence Devices, Inc. Bug Freqs
&gt;
&gt;135 MHz - 150 MHz  Special Order/Secondary Band
&gt;150 MHz - 174 MHz  Standard/Primary Band (Most Popular)
&gt;216 MHz - 220 MHz  Special Order
&gt;400 MHz - 470 MHz  UHF Repeaters
&gt;
&gt; 21 MHz -  80 MHz  Very Low Power WFM (.5mw - 10mw)  Special Order Only
&gt; 36 MHz -  39 MHz  Very Low Power WFM (.5mw - 50mw)  ***Very Dangerous***
&gt; 80 kHz - 200 kHz  "Line Carrier" Microphone Systems ***Very Dangerous***
&gt; 30 kHz - 700 kHz  Spread Spectrum Current Carrier Devices
&gt;
&gt;1700MHz - 1900MHz  25-250mw Video and audio bugs (Mostly DEA/DOJ stuff)
&gt;2400MHz - 2484MHz  25-250mw Video and audio bugs
&gt;
&gt;If the signal is "scrambled" it is nothing more than simple voice inversion,
&gt;a circuit to "de-scramble" costs around $20.
&gt;
&gt;Note: AID devices are often re-tuned for outband channels... so be careful.
&gt;
&gt;The area of spectrum from 15MHz to 500MHz is the primary threat, 500MHz to 3GHz
&gt;is the secondary threat, a "line carrier" threat is from 30kHz to 750kHz.
&gt;
&gt;If the person planting the bug suspects that a TSCM inspection may be
&gt;conducted then AID suggests a frequency between 30MHz to 50MHz,
&gt;sensitivity of rcvr should be better than .18uv/-122dbm. The mode is
&gt;usually wideband FM.
&gt;
&gt;Also, keep in mind that AID devices are frequently used for illegal buggings,
&gt;so be familiar with their realistic specs, expect power outputs well under
&gt;50mw, and expect to see the AC power circuits being used as the antenna.
&gt;
&gt;Note: Mike Langley at NIA advises that AID/NIA/Westinghouse is totally
&gt;shutting down all TSCM training, at that they have cancelled the production
&gt;of all TSCM products effective 1 Jan 97.
&gt;
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;Several devices were recently found at a DOE facility on Long Island,
&gt;details are a bit sketchy, but initial information indicates that a
&gt;defecting  middle-eastern FIS agent provided a list of locations within
&gt;several DOE facilties that were being targeted.TSCM inspection (not
&gt;performed by DOE) located several devices. Facility/lab working on designs
&gt;for triggering mechanisms... very interesting incident.

&gt;
&gt;Note: These little low power devices have an adjustable freq deviation
&gt;which can be adjusted to as high as +/- 225khz... System also uses a
&gt;matched receiver. Entire system xmitter and cvr sell for under $2500.
&gt;
&gt;Imagine a 3mw transmitter operating at 782mhz (snuggled up to the audio of
&gt;the local TV xmitter) using a 100khz cue channel subcarrier. Life
&gt;expectancy at least  350 hours (using lithium cells). Reasonable range at
&gt;least 1500 feet indoors.
&gt;
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;Finished putting the final touches on a new page
&gt;concerning Mace and Personal Protection Sprays.
&gt;
&gt;Drop by and let me know what you think.

&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;BMS manufactures a line of pro-grade products used primarly for the
&gt;Broadcast and Television markets, but their prices are cheap, very small,
&gt;low power, and a serious threat to our clients.
&gt;
&gt;Most of their voice/video/telem products (ie:BMT25-S) operates from
&gt;900mhz-4ghz, and are easily detectable at 10mw and 100mw.
&gt;
&gt;The major threat is from the X-Band, and Ku-Band devices which they sell
&gt;that operate up to 13.5ghz.
&gt;
&gt;Keep in mind the devices are as small as 1.0in x 1.0in x 3.3in, and can be
&gt;run from a 12vdc battery for days, if not weeks.
&gt;
&gt;Most of the devices utilize a variable frequency audio dual sub-carrier
&gt;between 4 to 9 mhz.
&gt;
&gt;They sell small omni directional, and highly directional antenna as well.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Direct Sequence output, 60 mhz window for spread spectrum
&gt;
&gt;Device designed to transmit FDM baseband signals from a PBX backplane using
&gt;QAM 64 or 256 modulation.
&gt;
&gt;The box I examined measured 1 * 3.5 * 3 and took power from 8 to 16 vdc (12
&gt;pref).
&gt;
&gt;Output power fixed at 100mw
&gt;
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;Recently I did some work designing an experimental spread sprectrum
&gt;wireless microphone.
&gt;
&gt;The goal of the project was to see just how small, and how cheaply a
&gt;realistic device could be built.
&gt;
&gt;Initial goal was a device that would use the 47 CFR 15.247 for the ISM band
&gt;from 902 to 928 mhz and an enhancement (jumper change) mode to extend the
&gt;upper frequency range to 954 mhz.
&gt;
&gt;The device would have to have a range of at least 150 feet in a hotel
&gt;building and/or office building (parking lot monitoring).
&gt;
&gt;The device must be small enough to be "dropped in a pocket," concealed in
&gt;the seam of a drape, and placed into furniture.
&gt;
&gt;Device must use consumer (radio shack) batteries.
&gt;
&gt;Device must cost less $100 in materials to build
&gt;
&gt;I felt the above specs would reflect a realistic device.
&gt;
&gt;---------------
&gt;
&gt;1) Battery used was 2ea EPX-76 cells which gave 2.5 to 3 hours of usable
&gt;audio, sub-ed a DL123A lithium which upped the time to over 4 days (and
&gt;still counting)
&gt;
&gt;2) Microphone was two surface mount Seimens hearing aid elements.
&gt;
&gt;3) Spread Spectrum controller was a surface mount WL-9010 from Wireless
&gt;Logic, the chip is a compact stand alone transmitter.
&gt;
&gt;4) Used a Mitsubishi codec chip commonly used in cellular telephone with a
&gt;noise cancelling circuit (this is why two microphones were used).
&gt;
&gt;5) Small pot was used to adjust the output power between .15mw to 65mw
&gt;
&gt;6) All components used where SMT versions, hot flow was used for assembly
&gt;
&gt;7) Entire circuit was assembled on a .30 by .25 inches square double sided
&gt;printed circuit board.
&gt;
&gt;8) PCB soldered directly to battery cap
&gt;
&gt;9) .5 inch long paper clip used as antenna
&gt;
&gt;10) Currently working on a telephone line version.
&gt;
&gt;11) Range at 50mw (legal power limit) tested usable and clear at 260 feet
&gt;(device placed in hotel room, and monitored in the parking lot)
&gt;
&gt;12) Device WAS NOT detectable with an AVCOM 65 until the antenna was within
&gt;8 inches of the device (until a hump started to slightly appear).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What doe this tell us?
&gt;
&gt;Spread spectrum devices can be real small, cheaply made, and low power
&gt;using off the shelf products.
&gt;
&gt;Watch that area between 800 mhz and 1 gig
&gt;
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;We are interested in purchasing old catalogs, training materials, and technical
&gt;documentation used by Audio Intelligence Devices, HDS, and other
&gt;surveillance companies.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically we are looking for:
&gt;
&gt;   Old product catalogs
&gt;   Sales materials picked up at trade shows (IE: NATIA)
&gt;   Training Manuals from National Intelligence Academy
&gt;   Textbooks from National Intelligence Academy
&gt;   Product Owners Manuals
&gt;   Product Service Manuals
&gt;
&gt;We are also interested in purchasing "generations" of materials, so if you
&gt;have ten years worth of old catalogs from the '70s were interested.
&gt;
&gt;Let us know what you've got, and we'll work out cash payment arrangements.
&gt;
&gt;The materials will be used for project that starts in January and will run
&gt;for at least six months.
&gt;
&gt;If you have materials from other technical intelligence schools or
&gt;surveillance we could also be interested.
&gt;
&gt;=================================================
&gt;
&gt;I recently had a chance to examine a new device made by Delft
&gt;Industries.
&gt;
&gt;It is very similar to the X-Band units I've examined,
&gt;except that the frequencies were higher and mods were much
&gt;more subtle.
&gt;
&gt;Small PCB was cemented into the rear of the unit, underneath the regular
&gt;PCB (black rubber covered 1.5 cm * 4cm * .8cm).
&gt;
&gt;Unit consited of a two microphones, compander circuits,
&gt;power supply/regulator, and modulator circuit.
&gt;
&gt;Compander circuit operated dual circuits around 120hz to 15khz.
&gt;
&gt;No external mods to case, only very small variation in power drain,
&gt;no internal battery, several large surface mount caps...
&gt;
&gt;Entire unit double sided surface mount PCB, looks like 4 layers,
&gt;2/3 digital circuitry, 1/3 analog and RF circuitry.
&gt;
&gt;The only mods to the alarm PCB was the cutting of several traces
&gt;on the back of the PCB (near the emitter circuit).
&gt;
&gt;The doppler alarm operated between 24 ghz and 24.25 ghz, intelligence
&gt;seems to be a 480k bit digital data stream using the alarm
&gt;signal as the carrier (QAM mod).
&gt;
&gt;Looks like one version of the product will also allow someone
&gt;to deactivate a specific sensor remotely upon on command.
&gt;
&gt;According to the factory, the units are being shipped into
&gt;Canada and Mexico in quanity, then transported into the
&gt;US in small quantities.
&gt;
&gt;Heavy usage in Texas, New Orleans, Florida, California,
&gt;and Pennsylvania.
&gt;
&gt;Device have already been offered for sale in several
&gt;"spy shops" in New York, and Miami.
&gt;
&gt;- Be Careful Out There
&gt;
&gt;========================================================
&gt;
&gt;You may find it interesting to revist our web site in
&gt;the near future, during the last few months the site has
&gt; undergone incredible growth, copius additions, and changes..
&gt;
&gt;        <A  HREF="http://www.tscm.com/">http://www.tscm.com/</A>
&gt;
&gt;On January 2, 1997 we rolled out several new
&gt;product lines which increased the number of TSCM products
&gt;on our web page to over 1,000 TSCM and technical security
&gt;products.
&gt;
&gt;At the present time we have over 12,500 pages of
&gt;printed documents available for download.
&gt;
&gt;If you haven't reviewed it yet, be advised that we now
&gt;have a TDR tutorial page available online.
&gt;
&gt;        <A  HREF="http://www.tscm.com/riserbond.html">http://www.tscm.com/riserbond.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We've also updated the materials we have online
&gt;regarding the REI OSC-5000
&gt;
&gt;        <A  HREF="http://www.tscm.com/reioscor.html">http://www.tscm.com/reioscor.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ===============================================================
&gt;
&gt;DOJ just took delivery of a large number of video transmitter modules
&gt;
&gt;Operating freqs between 8ghz and 11 ghz (PLL field programmable)
&gt;
&gt;10mw rf output (max), nominal 8.5mw
&gt;
&gt;power draw below 35ma
&gt;
&gt;baseband video trans, not SS
&gt;
&gt;all modules have audio inputs (solder tab), standard audio subcarrier,
&gt;audio section may be disabled to conserve power.
&gt;
&gt;Min. effective (flat array ant) range indicated as 2700 feet line of sight,
&gt;and 1500 rural.
&gt;
&gt;I would estimate the range to be below 500 ft with a unity gain antenna.
&gt;
&gt;A number of the units came preinstalled in fake squirel and
&gt;birds nests with a low light auto iris CCD camera (unk manuf, suspect
&gt;Kodak). I've seen similar units used by the DEA (installed under tree
&gt;bark).
&gt;
&gt;Both unity gain ant config (stub), and biconical flat pack.
&gt;
&gt;Power requirements seem to correlate to 9vdc lithium batteries.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From what I can see on the physical specs, looks like the transmitter, and
&gt;camera combined are 2/3 the size of a standard 9vdc battery.
&gt;
&gt;The document indicates gvt paid $874 per module (Xmit module only),
&gt;document also mentions req code for the "domestic counterterrorism"
&gt;program.
&gt;
&gt;I wonder if these are the "tree frogs" that the boys at Quantico were
&gt;trying to get bids on, back in September?
&gt;
&gt;It's only a matter of a few months before these devices start getting
&gt;"lost in the field " and start re-appearing in the private sector.
&gt;
&gt; ===============================================================
&gt;
&gt;I've heard from several engineers at TI that an unidentified gvt law
&gt;enforcement agency has them working on a super compact thermal imaging
&gt;system and video transmitter for covert surveillance. System utilizes an
&gt;electronic LCD chopper instead of the regular mechanical chopper. Device
&gt;contains integral microwave tranmitter (unk freq). From what I can gather,
&gt;these are going to be used for conducting long term thermal surveillance of
&gt;areas... I will advise as I obtain further intel.
&gt;
&gt; ===============================================================
&gt;
&gt;Just finished reading the 1997 Hewlett Packards optoelectronics designers
&gt;guide, and found several items of interest.
&gt;
&gt;Most of us are familiar with the low power 900nm I/R devices.
&gt;
&gt;But did you know that they also make CHEAP LED's for communications
&gt;that operate from 700nm to 1510nm??
&gt;
&gt;700, 710, 875, 905, 940, 1100, and 1510nm are the most common products in
&gt;the HEMT line.
&gt;
&gt;Can be modulated (open air) from 0 to 750khz with no problem, and higher speeds
&gt;with some minor distortion.
&gt;
&gt;just a heads up
&gt;
&gt; ===============================================================
&gt;
&gt;We are taking delivery of the first 95S radio's and third generation MSS
&gt;units from Boeing... We are expecting initial shipments to customers mid to
&gt;end of Feb.
&gt;
&gt;The 95S is a stand alone wideband receiver designed for SIGINT and TSCM,
&gt;weighs in at just under 8 lbs (complete). Radio will retail for around
&gt;6,000 and 7,500 dollars (US) depending on config.
&gt;
&gt;While the unit is fully self contained, we will have a VME version avail
&gt;(we have them now). Coverage is a clean from 5khz to 8ghz (yes 8ghz), and
&gt;sensitivity is superior to anything Watkins Johnson makes.
&gt;
&gt;Reciever is being built into the new MSS-3500 briefcase system, which will
&gt;allow automated spectrum monitoring of 40ghz of spectrum in 8/9ghz
&gt;segments.
&gt;
&gt; ===============================================================
&gt;
&gt;Just finished playing with a nasty little Radio Shack (CM-421)
&gt;single channel VHF microphone.
&gt;
&gt;While the product is designed for use in the 160-220 range, it's designed
&gt;so that to be recrystalized and usable anywhere in the world.
&gt;
&gt;The product can be easily retuned from 90-300Mhz (by the book), power
&gt;output is variable via a pot from 5mw to 50mw.
&gt;
&gt;Current drain is around 40ma at 50mw, and much lower for 5mw output.
&gt;
&gt;Product is extremely stable, with adjustable deviations (to +/1 100khz)
&gt;
&gt;Integral tietack microphone
&gt;
&gt;Radio Shack will sell the xmitter only for around
&gt;50 bucks (I bought several to eval)
&gt;
&gt; ===============================================================
&gt;
&gt;Recently had access to some of the new fiber optic devices out there and
&gt;wanted to post some of the techniques by which they can be detected.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Subject device optics are made by Corning Glass, and consists of three
&gt;components. The "electronics" are manufactured by E-systems in Dallas, TX.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The entire installation kit fits into two 18 * 22 * 7 briefcases made by
&gt;SKB, the first case contains a battery powered automatic fusion
&gt;splicer/LID, equipment to test the installation, and a tool kit. The second
&gt;case contains the microphones, spools of "cable", optical modules,
&gt;controllers, and battery packs
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1. "Front-End Microphone" is a small glass cylinder roughly 2.5mm wide x
&gt;5mm long with a small 1.5mm long pinhole tube on one end, and a 3 to 12 ft
&gt;50/125 fiber tail on the other. This part of the system is designed to be
&gt;installed "pinhole" style. Pigtail cable is routed to and fusion spliced
&gt;into a "Runner Cable". The microphone contains small barbs to keep it in
&gt;position with out the use of adhesives. A small 2.5mm needle drill bit is
&gt;used to drill the hole.
&gt;
&gt;2. The "Runner Cable" is a 50um/125um fiber optic bundle, typically 3 to 8
&gt;fibers are combined to allow a single runner to support 6-8 devices. This
&gt;cable is flat and measures roughly 125um high, and .75 to 1mm wide. Cable
&gt;has a min. bend radius of 4cm, and is field terminated with a small
&gt;automated fusion splicer to the "Front-End Microphone". This cable can be
&gt;left loose or secured with an adhesive. Installation kit contains a small
&gt;flexible installation tube to assist in installing below carpet or behind
&gt;wood panelling.
&gt;
&gt;3. The "Repeater" consists of a disguised box roughly 15cm x 5cm x 5cm,
&gt;with an optional battery pack/power supply/trickle charger (15cm x 10cm x
&gt;5cm) or the device can be powered directly off of AC Mains. The repeater
&gt;can be easily installed and hidden in a cinder block or concrete on an
&gt;outside wall. It looks like the device is for long term installations, it
&gt;is totally sealed and the electronics have conformal coatings/potting.
&gt;
&gt;Device appears to emit a RF digital signal using 64/128/256 QAM Spread
&gt;Spectrum modulation on programmable frequencies between 1.5ghz and 8.5 ghz.
&gt;Modulator is contained into a "flat-pack" style antenna module. A 512kbps
&gt;baseband signal is supplied to the antenna (bit stream can go as high as
&gt;2mbps, the one I examined was set for 512).
&gt;
&gt;Note: The "repeater" supplies the antenna with a baseband signal, control
&gt;codes, and power. The modulator/transmitter is contained in the antenna.
&gt;
&gt;The device uses an RF guard channel that is used to deactivate all
&gt;emissions (Go Mute) upon remote command.
&gt;
&gt;The "repeater" utilizes 8 fiber outputs (it has 8 field replacable optical
&gt;modules), and one min. SMA connector for the baseband output. Suspect the
&gt;device can also be be uploaded with transmision times. It also contains
&gt;sufficent memory (32mb) to hold a good 4 hours or more of compressed audio.
&gt;
&gt;Repeater can also transmit (Spread Spectrum) over telco or power lines with
&gt;a small adapter (I was not able to secure the frequencies, but I suspect
&gt;somewhere between 200khz and 3 mhz).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Device Operation:
&gt;
&gt;System uses a 50/125 Raw fiber optic distribution system, the fiber is
&gt;coated, but not jacketed or buffered in any way. The fiber has a frequency
&gt;response between 1230 to 1550/1710? single mode. I suspect it is standard
&gt;single mode (1500nm) fiber strand.
&gt;
&gt;The "Repeater" contains a low power single mode solid state light source, a
&gt;duplexer/splitter (prism), and a light reciever. The light beam is
&gt;transmitted into the fiber, travels to the "Front-End" where it is is
&gt;reflected against an angled vibrating membrane. The membrane causes a
&gt;slight frequency shift in the light beam, which is reflected back to the
&gt;"Repeater" where it is "picked" off with a prism and solid state detector.
&gt;(typical fiber optic microphone).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Counter-Measures:
&gt;
&gt;There is NO METAL in the microphone or fiber distribution system, and they
&gt;CANNOT be detected by a Non-Lin (no non-linear junctions). Nor can they be
&gt;detected with metal detectors, and no electro-magnetic field is present on
&gt;the "Front End".
&gt;
&gt;The "Repeater" section is fairly to detect with a non lin, but since it is
&gt;supposed installed into the outside wall it tends not to be practical. The
&gt;ideal way to detect is to sweep the exterior of the building for RF
&gt;emissions. Also, the unit tends to run VERY hot (110-135 degrees), and
&gt;should be visible as a thermal anomally.
&gt;
&gt;Also, the system can be detected by looking for minute amounts of light
&gt;"leaking" from both the microphone, fusion couplings, and fiber
&gt;distribution system.
&gt;
&gt;The pinhole for the microphone can be detected with a IR visual search
&gt;around 440 to 450nm (you'll need a light source with at least 500,00 candle
&gt;power, the Blue Light Ultra works well, or an Omnichrome).
&gt;
&gt;Once a suspect pinhole is found it can be tested for IR with a conventional
&gt;Spectrum Analyser with a IR front end (the Tektronix SA-42 or SA-46 works
&gt;well). There is always a small amount or IR leakage with this system.
&gt;
&gt;Once the microphone is detected it is a fairly simple matter to trace the
&gt;line back to the controller module or "Repeater"
&gt;
&gt;Keep in mind that the system is designed to use 3 to 8 microphones.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I am going to get a look at an OC-12 clamp-on fiber optic tapping system in
&gt;a few weeks and will advise.
