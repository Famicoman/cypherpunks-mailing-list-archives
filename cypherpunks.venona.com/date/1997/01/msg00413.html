This [below] is one of the most remarkable posts I've ever seen....

&gt; &gt; &gt; However U.S.G. is able to say that people of Iraq or Lybia or Cuba
&gt; &gt; &gt; should not be permitted on the 'net. It also bombs Iraq and murders
&gt; &gt; &gt; their civilians in retaliation for something their governments
&gt; &gt; &gt; supposedly did.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The U.S.G. has many more resources than most of us to do these things,
&gt; &gt; &gt; including equipment, cooperative troops, money, and recognition from
&gt; &gt; &gt; other governments.   If other nations disagree with the U.S.G. they
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the resources to discuss, bargain, negotiate, criticize, form
&gt; &gt; &gt; alliances, take their chances and retaliate, etc.

&gt; &gt; I wish this were true, at least of nations which would be friendly
&gt; &gt; to someone like me (white, Western, etc.).  A bully on a school
&gt; &gt; playground can always be knocked down, no matter how big or how
&gt; &gt; vicious he is.  Sadly, the U.S. bully cannot be knocked down.  Bad
&gt; &gt; enough you get nuclear, chemical, and/or biological stuff waved at
&gt; &gt; you - if you get into a hot war like Desert Storm, your country is
&gt; &gt; carpet-bombed with fleets of B-52's until it is thoroughly debilitated.

&gt; Actually the US is being remarkably ineffective in keeping
&gt; Cuba etc off the Net. If you don't believe me just try
&gt; the cuban home page. We had a Web server running in Sarajevo
&gt; during the siege back in '93. There is no way that the US govt.
&gt; can hope to control the Internet any more than it can control the
&gt; phone system. What is astonishing is that the Cuban authorities are
&gt; so keen to import a technology that breaks down their propaganda.

This *is* amazing.  The cuban govt. is *eager* (keen) to subvert
their own propaganda.

&gt; The Cold War was not won by the arms race, it was won in
&gt; Eastern Europe which was never a major participant. The main
&gt; instrument that won it was West German TV which broadcast
&gt; pictures of supermarkets with full shelves into the homes
&gt; of East Germans every night. The viewers could see that it
&gt; was not mere propaganda and their relatives confirmed the
&gt; fact. As a result the East German guards on the Berlin wall
&gt; simply decided to leave their posts one night.

That's it?  The system collapsed because the guards left their posts?
And no mutiny charges?  Incredible.

&gt; The East Germans couldn't stop the TV signals either. When
&gt; Dresden started to become a ghost town because people wanted
&gt; to move to a town which could recieve the broadcasts the
&gt; East Germans ended up installing their own relay to keep
&gt; the locals happy.

People left their own home towns just so they could watch TV?  I
know a lot of Americans who'd like to leave their towns to get away
from TV, permanently.
