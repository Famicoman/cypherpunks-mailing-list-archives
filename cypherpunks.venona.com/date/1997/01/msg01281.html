&gt;The Path To Revolution
&gt;
&gt;You Don't Have To Be There To Experience It
&gt;
&gt;By Linton Weeks
&gt;Washington Post Staff Writer
&gt;Thursday, January 9 1997; Page C5
&gt;The Washington Post 
&gt;
&gt;The computer is a revolutionary tool.
&gt;
&gt;It really is. Revolutionaries, counterrevolutionaries, 
&gt;extremist groups, radical wings, separatist movements, 
&gt;cults, and their critics and sympathizers are aswarm on 
&gt;the Net. Never before have so many people had direct access 
&gt;to information from every angle. It's like a teeming
&gt;hive of Gutenbergs. 
&gt;
&gt;For instance, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, 
&gt;the Peruvian guerrillas who took hostages in the Japanese 
&gt;embassy in Lima just before Christmas, has a Web presence. Its
&gt;"Solidarity Page," with a link to the official Spanish-language 
&gt;Tupac Amaru site in Europe, is nursed by a Toronto-based group 
&gt;called Arm the Spirit.
&gt;
&gt;The solidarity page is touted on a more elaborate site 
&gt;sponsored by the U.S. Committee to Support the Revolution in 
&gt;Peru. Based in Berkeley, this committee sings the song of the
&gt;Communist Party of Peru, also known as Shining Path.
&gt;
&gt;"Welcome to a real revolution in cyberspace!" reads the 
&gt;Shining Path page. "We expose the lies about the 
&gt;revolution put forward by the U.S.-backed Fujimori regime and 
&gt;its apologists, while opposing U.S. and other foreign 
&gt;intervention. We organize against the repression and
&gt;terror directed at the revolution and the Peruvian people."
&gt;
&gt;Sinn Fein, the radical political wing of the Irish Republican 
&gt;Army, the armed and rebellious Sri Lankan Liberation Tigers 
&gt;of Tamil Eelam and a multitude of U.S.-based "Aryan"
&gt;revolutionaries also have carefully designed Web sites. (Such 
&gt;sites are so devoid of humor that it seems likely these people 
&gt;really are who they say they are.)
&gt;
&gt;These are prime spots for unfiltered propaganda. Here in the 
&gt;home of the free and the frenetic, the Net is protected by 
&gt;the First Amendment and the wholesale distribution of
&gt;political information -- the good, the bad, the ugly -- is as 
&gt;old as Thanksgiving. Thomas Paine would have had an amazing home page.
&gt;
&gt;The Shining Path pages are elaborate. Various links highlight 
&gt;"the crimes of the U.S.-backed Fujimori regime," list the 
&gt;political prisoners in Peru, reprint the press releases of Shining 
&gt;Path and Tupac Amaru and offer a gallery of incendiary souvenirs 
&gt;you can buy -- leaflets, buttons, T-shirts and cassettes of 
&gt;revolutionary music.
&gt;
&gt;The site also gives users a way to "hook up with, support 
&gt;and/or join us." But it warns those interested not to use 
&gt;e-mail, because U.S. government officials might be monitoring 
&gt;it. "We encourage you to contact us by postal mail, phone or fax."
&gt;
&gt;"Terrorist fund-raising is illegal in this country," said one 
&gt;U.S. State Department staffer who was reluctant to talk about 
&gt;the government's monitoring of any Web pages. Speaking only on
&gt;background, the staffer said that extremist Web sites are mostly 
&gt;posted by U.S. citizens and are viewed as domestic material, 
&gt;which is under the jurisdiction of the FBI and the Justice
&gt;Department, both of which have Web sites.
&gt;
&gt;"There is genuine international concern that this information 
&gt;is freely available -- and that it's legal," the staffer said. 
&gt;
&gt;John Russell of the Justice Department said, "There are First 
&gt;Amendment considerations and there are legitimate law enforcement 
&gt;concerns." The Justice Department, he said, would like
&gt;"to find a legal and acceptable procedure" to discover who 
&gt;is posting the information. He said several law enforcement 
&gt;agencies, including the FBI, ATF and DEA, are planning a joint
&gt;meeting soon to discuss the proliferation of such rabble-rousing pages.
&gt;
&gt;The Internet brings the far-flung complexities and dangers of the 
&gt;world a little closer to home. The bright side is that most 
&gt;people savvy enough to use the Internet may also be sophisticated
&gt;enough to sort out the truth in the information supplied by 
&gt;various groups such as Tupac Amaru, Sinn Fein and the Department of Justice.
