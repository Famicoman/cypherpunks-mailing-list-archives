&gt; Well, I see that you could'nt leave well enough alone... :-)
&gt;
&gt; Since Snow decided to jump into your face on this one, I might as well
&gt; throw my $0.02 on the table as well. Funny how my trashcan stays very empty
&gt; these days now that cypherpunks is in my bit bucket...

I suggest you subscribe to cypherpunks-unedited. It may go away, but
for now it's much more interesting than the censored version.

&gt; Frankly, it does not surprise me that homosexuality is yet another
&gt; pointless off-topic to be discussed on the list.

Thanks to the moderation, only one side of the issue gets aired anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt; +Thank God for AIDS.

Amen.

&gt; &gt;&gt;         when AIDS was relatively obscure, I always dismissed AIDS as
&gt; &gt;&gt;     God's response to homosexuality (and other crimes against nature);
&gt; &gt;&gt;     i.e. -settlement by a just God.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I almost threw a dumb ass redneck of a ship in the middle of the ocean
&gt; &gt;for a comment like this.
...
&gt; This politically correct bullshit response is just symptomatic of someone
&gt; who is uncomfortable with the position taken for expediency's sake and is
&gt; trying to justify to himself the course taken.

The "politically correct" homosexuals, like snow and gilmore and sandfart
consider (violent) action to be a reasonable response to speech they don't like
(e.g. "homophobic") - not "more speech". Someone says something you disagree
with on a mailing list? Unsubscribe him! Ban him from the list! Institute
moderation to auto-discard everything he says! Curiously, African-American
children are taught that violence is a correct response to "racist" speech.

ObEbonics: "Dot's right, judge, I shot da mothafucka cuz he call me a nigga!"

&gt; &gt;    I've read a lot of your rantings on this list, and I agree with some of
&gt; &gt;them, but statements like this prove that you are a bigoted idiot. You may
&gt; &gt;have some areas where you know what you are talking about, and I wouldn't
&gt; want
&gt; &gt;to be on the sharp end of a gun you were holding, but your head is
&gt; definately
&gt; &gt;stuck firmly up your ass.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, we throw down the gauntlet here in true USENET style, and in keeping
&gt; with that, have nothing of value to say (just name calling).

When they run out of things to say, they start pulling plugs,
unsubscribing people, and "moderating"...

&gt; &gt;     1) If homosexuality is a "choice", why would anyone choose that
&gt; lifestyle
&gt; &gt;where the averge life expectancy is in the 40's, that causes so much pain
&gt; &gt;among ones family, and so much conflict with the rest of society.

I can answer this one, having worked for Jesuits: having deviant sexual desires
may not be a choice, but willingly committing unnatural acts to satisfy your
deviant desires is a choice.

&gt; &gt;     The answer is you can't. You adopt a knee-jerk position that reinforces
&gt; &gt;your deliberate isolationism. Anything that may cause you to question your
&gt; &gt;worldview gets sorted to /dev/evil and you plow ahead like some pig ignorant
&gt; &gt;dough boy killing as ordered for king and country.
&gt;
&gt; Who's the ignorant one here? The name caller or the recipient. My vote goes
&gt; to the name caller, as he assumes this to be a debate of fact, when in
&gt; essence he's expressed only his opinion on the matter and not bothered to
&gt; show teacher his homework (the dog ate it - so give me an "A" anyway 'cause
&gt; I deserve it). ;-&gt;

And when the namecalling doesn't work, they respond with violence.
