&gt; According to Rick Osborne:
&gt; 
&gt; "I disagree and can speak from experience.  I was denied admission to MIT
&gt; even thought I had a 3.82 GPA, 1440 SAT (one try), and had taken 9 AP tests
&gt; with two 5's, four 4's, two 3's, and one 2.  As for being well-rounded, I
&gt; was on several academic teams, sang in Chorus, acted and stage managed in
&gt; Drama, and played Tennis."
&gt; 
&gt; People get into MIT--or don't get into MIT--for lots of reasons. Most
&gt; intelligent people apply to several schools, knowing that admissions
&gt; practices are subject to the vagaries of reality.
&gt; 
&gt; In my case, my SATs were about 1500, with some 800s in achievement tests.
&gt; And the usual bullshit high school clubs, political offices, etc. etc. I
&gt; was accepted by MIT, but not by Caltech. I didn't lose any sleep over the
&gt; way things turned out.
&gt; 
&gt; And I decided not to go to MIT, either.
&gt; 
&gt; "The only thing I didn't have that the next MIT applicant had was money.  I
&gt; made the mistake of letting them know that I was dirt poor and would need
&gt; full aid/grants/etc, and to quote "The Great Escape" it was "Zzzt! To the
&gt; Russian front!""
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is that "other factors" were involved. 
&gt; 
&gt; I noted with some interest, but little surprise, that the guy claiming MIT
&gt; required a 4.0 GPA and a 1600 combined SAT score could barely spell, and
&gt; had major problems making a coherent point. Methinks this is why MIT
&gt; rejected him, not his lack of a "1600."
&gt; 
&gt; "&gt;For what it's worth, I wanted to go to MIT my sophomore year in high
&gt; &gt;school, too
&gt; 
&gt; "Lucky you.  It had been a dream of mine since I was an annoying
&gt; overachiever of 6.  Sux to be white trash, I guess."
&gt; 
&gt; MIT offered me a substantial economic aid package, in the form of loans,
&gt; grants, and various campus jobs. What does this tell you?
&gt; 
&gt; "MIT may be a great school, but they tend to be snooty assholes for the most
&gt; part.  (DISCLAIMER: Not all MIT grads/attendees are necessarily "snooty
&gt; assholes", I'm just saying that I've yet to meet one that wasn't.)
&gt; 
&gt; I've known about a dozen or so MIT grads, and only one of them was a snooty
&gt; asshole, and it was a _she_, one of the first MIT women grads (and she was
&gt; _very_ impressed by this). 
&gt; 
&gt; Most MIT grads are perfectly reasonable.
