&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really, I had an I.Q. of 149, and a perfect 4.00 from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two different colleges, before I did my Doctorate in Law.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 149 puts you at the low end of the scale, or used to, around here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; True, they say genius only starts at 150; but I think I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; improved since then.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This betrays your ignorance.  I.Q. is scaled according to age.  One does
&gt; &gt; not "improve."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have no ignorance, except for being ignorant of stupid people
&gt; who call themselves "punks."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fact (if true) that you bothered to get a Doctorate in Law, rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than a Juris Doctor, tends to disprove the above however.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Look dude, a Juris Doctor IS a Doctorate of Law.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Incorrect.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Look asshole; it says "LAW DOCTOR" -- that is what "Juris Doctor"
&gt; means, stupid.  And I am about to stick the motherfucking Laws
&gt; right up your cocksucking ASS!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One can obtain a Doctorate in Law, (As in Dr.) but it is generally a
&gt; &gt; pointless endeavor except in some civil law jurisdictions.  (Liechtenstein
&gt; &gt; is a good example, where many attornies have a Dr.Iur. (Dr.) while others
&gt; &gt; merely have a Lic.Iur. (J.D.) ).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A J.D. requires no dissertation.
&gt; &gt; A Doctorate in Law does.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong.  A J.D. requires a 75 page moot-court dissertation which
&gt; is always new legal research.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I submit you know too little about any of these to have attained either
&gt; &gt; one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not confuse it with a L.L.D. which is a "Doctorate
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Legal Letters"  A J.D. is the only current valid
&gt; &gt; &gt; Doctorate that you can do in plain "Law."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Incorrect.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A J.D. is not a true Doctorate, and even if it were, it would not be the
&gt; &gt; only current valid "Doctorate" that you can "do" in "plain Law."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; "Juris" means Law.  So Juris Doctor means "Law Doctor."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Georgetown, as an example, offers a Doctorate in Law degree which requires
&gt; &gt; a J.D., an LL.M. and three years of legal teaching experience simply to
&gt; &gt; qualify for the program.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; that is irrelevant, and you are off-topic.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A Doctor of Judicial Science program is also available with many of the
&gt; &gt; same requirements.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Both programs require a dissertation and a defense of same.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; San Marcos University is also known for an exceptional Doctor of Laws
&gt; &gt; program.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Incidently, LL.D.s are rare and generally useful only in European circles.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Europe is also irrelevant, and you keep missing the point here.
&gt; You have added the cypherpunks list again, and that was forbidden.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As usual, you have overextended your bounds and now find yourself swimming
&gt; &gt; in water over your head.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; look asshole, you really want that list killed, do you not?
&gt; I have no bounds, as you will soon learn.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go to law school.  In the meantime, shut up.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go and eat your swiss cheese, as that is apparently all you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are good for.  My mercenaries are too busy to go to europe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer Chedder.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be careful who you threaten.  It might get you in trouble.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Threatening to wipe out your location on the InterNet is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not against ANY law whatsoever, and I can mailbomb you, do
&gt; &gt; &gt; a DOS attack, fork-bomb attack and virus attack against you,
&gt; &gt; &gt; all of which are perfectly legal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually, they are not.  Unauthorized access of a computer system is a
&gt; &gt; crime.  Anyone who had a "doctorate" in law would know this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; WRONG!  There is NO crime which covers anything that one does
&gt; internationally!   And mailbombing is NOT "Unauthorized access,"
&gt; regardless of where it occurs!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I doubt your reference to mercenaries was merely a threat to my system,
&gt; &gt; but keep pushing if you like.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look asshole, I graduated from Law School with a Doctorate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 1975.  Now just go away and stop interfering with our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; American Net.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which law school?  And did you do a dissertation?  What is its title?  Do
&gt; &gt; you practice?  What state are you licensed in?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Pitt-1975; Dissertation was in 1983 actions.  I practiced for
&gt; six years, and then became perfect.  I currently do not practice for
&gt; any parties other than myself, family, corporation or Institutes,
&gt; and I need no license for that. And since I do not carry any
&gt; license from any State, there is NOTHING that you can do to stop me.
&gt; The State disciplinary board has no jurisdiction, nor does any
&gt; Law.  A Criminal Lawyer is a specialist in ripping new assholes
&gt; on the witness stand, and that must now also be practiced on the net,
&gt; it seems.  Remember, you are the one who asked for this, "Sadam."
&gt; 
&gt; This is a world-wide internet problem that you are about to get
&gt; taken care of.  You will be among the first locations to be
&gt; eliminated.  And just remember that your termination is your own
&gt; doing.  You had your chance to keep the fucking cypherpunks list
&gt; OFF of your e-mail to me, and blew it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Face the real fact of life though dude.  There is absolutely NO LAW
&gt; &gt; &gt; which prevents me from attacking and/or eliminating any address
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the USA, that is, even if there were any law which would
&gt; &gt; &gt; prevent me from doing the same thing to any non-government
&gt; &gt; &gt; computer right here, which there is not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ok, do it.  We'll see.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You asked for it, so what you have coming is your own doing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your only protection on this Internet is to have a dozen different
&gt; &gt; &gt; addresses to access from.  I can put a dozen computers up on
&gt; &gt; &gt; a dozen different T1's right now, if need be.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suggest a hobby which entails more physical activity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I pump iron and run three times a week.  And as a Tae Kwon Do
&gt; black belt holder, I get lots of physical activity. I am in
&gt; better physical shape than any other man that you know.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Now YOU have added the cypherpunks list again.
&gt; A proper reaction is justified, so have the cypherpunks
&gt; thank you for what is coming...
&gt; 
&gt; And just understand, as far as the internet is concerned, Europe does
&gt; not mean SHIT!
&gt; 
&gt; Your audience is terminated, permanently.
