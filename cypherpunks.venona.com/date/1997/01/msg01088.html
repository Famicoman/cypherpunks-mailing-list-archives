Subj:  Cylink and RSA Data Security Reach Legal Settlement; Public Key
Encryption Compa
Date:  Tue, Jan 7, 1997 7:52 AM EST
From:  AOLNewsProfiles@aol.net

      REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 1997--RSA Data
Security, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security Dynamics
Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SDTI), and Cylink Corporation
(NASDAQ:CYLK), today announced a comprehensive global settlement of
their long-standing legal disputes.
          The settlement ends all outstanding litigation between Cylink and
RSA.
          The two companies reached an amicable resolution of their
disputes.  As part of the settlement, Cylink granted to RSA all
necessary rights to Cylink's Stanford patents, and RSA granted to
Cylink a license to RSA's cryptographic software toolkits.
          For both parties, the settlement ends further prolongation of a
legal dispute that has been costly and distracting.  RSA is
fulfilling the promise made to its customers to resolve the disputes
with Cylink.  Cylink, under its new president and chief executive, is
refocusing all of its energies on providing end-to-end data security
products and solutions, and has the ability to incorporate RSA or
other technologies to meet customer requirements.
          "We are very pleased that what had so long seemed to be an
intractable problem has, within the space of 10 days, now been
resolved by the new management at Cylink," said James Bidzos,
president of RSA.  "I worked well with Fernand Sarrat while he was at
IBM, and that working relationship helped us reach this agreement so
swiftly.  This agreement turns long-time antagonists into companies
that are already exploring ways of working together constructively,
to the benefit of the industry as a whole."
          Fernand Sarrat, president and chief executive officer of Cylink,
said, "We are setting out on an aggressive new course at Cylink in
which old disputes are an unnecessary distraction.  RSA will be one
of our strategic suppliers and we anticipate focusing totally on the
needs of our customers and the enormous market opportunity before
us."

RSA Data Security, Inc.
          RSA Data Security, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security
Dynamics Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SDTI), is the world's brand
