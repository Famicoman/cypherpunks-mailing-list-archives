&gt; Actually, what you *really* want is one of those 400-lb-flywheel jobs that
&gt; the tree surgeons use to mulch big tree limbs up with. I worked behind one
&gt; one summer in college. They are *indeed* impressive.
&gt;
&gt; Don't forget to freeze everything before you put it in there, though. Works
&gt; cleaner and faster.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, there was a case a few years where a guy did exactly that with
&gt; his wife, her deep-frozen and all. Only problem was the cops figured it out
&gt; after they found out he had rented one of these things shortly before she
&gt; disappeared. Though they didn't find anything of her after the critters in
&gt; woods behind his house had their "one *tasty* burger", John Law did break
&gt; the tree mulcher down and find DNA-confirmed microscopic bits of her in the
&gt; machine's um, interstices... Remember, return the tools clean folks, or you
&gt; don't get your deposit back.
&gt;
&gt; Reminds me of the headless biker we talked about here a while ago.

This reminds me of a story that happened 5 or 6 years ago to a sovok
who used to be a dentist back in Russia. He couldn't become a dentist
in the U.S., so he became a stockbroker out in the midwest. He lost
some money for another sovok. Sovok #2 asked sovok #1 nicely for a
reimbursement, but he refused. So, he killed him and ran his body
through one of those tree mulching things. They never found much of
sovok #1's body. However sovok #2 was so stupid that he stole #1's
Rolex watch and was seen wearing it, so he got arrested and even
convicted.

&gt; Whoops! Gotta run. Time for lunch!
&gt;
&gt; I *love* this list...

Just stay away from sovoks.
