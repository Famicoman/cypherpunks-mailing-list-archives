 Quotes that make sense:

  " A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring
others, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own persuits
of industry and improvement, shall not take from the mouth of labor the
bread it has earned.  This is the sum of good government."

-- Thomas Jefferson,  First Inaugural Address,  March 4, 1801


" When more of the people's sustenance is extacted through the form of
taxation than is necessary to meet the just obligations of government  and
expenses of its economical administration,  such exaction becomes ruthless
and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free government."

-- Grover Cleveland,  Second Annual Message,  December, 1886


"The death of democracy is not likely to be assassination from ambush.
It will be a slow extinction from apathy,  indifference,  and  undernourishment."

-- Robert M.  Hutchins,  Great Books  (1954)


"The point to remember is that what the government gives,  it must
first take away."

--  John S. Coleman,  Address to Detroit Chamber of  Commerce
