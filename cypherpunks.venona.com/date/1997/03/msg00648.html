&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and just why is Gilmore such a jerk?  Could his homosexuality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have anything to do with it?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Doubtful.  Given the fact that gay people suffer a great deal of
&gt; &gt; &gt; discrimination, they generally tend to be fairly open-minded.  I see
&gt; &gt; &gt; no reason to believe Gilmore is in fact gay, but if he is it in no way
&gt; &gt; &gt; affects my opinion of him.
&gt; 
&gt; (It sure doesn't affect my opinion of him.  He's such a total jerk
&gt; and a conspiring creep that I haven't had to consider anything else).
&gt; 
&gt; Funny, isn't it?  Those people who *allegedly* suffer the most dis-
&gt; crimination seem to be having the most fun, if you can call it that.
&gt; If I were gay, which I'm not, I could get all the boyfriends I want.
&gt; But being heterosexual, I would very much like to have women friends
&gt; (just as friends mind you) for ordinary social purposes, yet it's not
&gt; that easy.  I'd guess the gays are much more liberal with their multi-
&gt; friendships than straight people are.
&gt; 
&gt; Another funny thing - I'm an ordinary English/Welsh/Dutch White person,
&gt; and I've had plenty of White friends, and an equal percentage of Black
&gt; friends given the number of Black people I've known, but I've never
&gt; had a friend who was gay or lesbian, as far as I know, and I think
&gt; I could tell.  I can only guess that the gays are very clique-ish,
&gt; or their brains are wired differently than non-gays.
&gt; 

That is it in a nutshell.
faggots are just not built like straight people.

&gt; &gt; Well, the fact remains that the homos are instrumental in creating and
&gt; &gt; forming a cliquish and censored usenet.  There is just no question
&gt; &gt; about that.  Remember the previous cypherpunk who stated that the
&gt; &gt; gays "created and run usenet."

and they were serious about that fact.

J.D. Falk was one of the faggots that said that, too.

&gt; &gt; It is very logical and wise to discriminate on the basis of sex.
&gt; &gt; I am not a racist, so therefore I can not be a "bigot," regardless of
&gt; &gt; my views on homosexuality.
