&gt; &gt; [remailer encrypts data, sends recipient encrypted data, and keeps
&gt; &gt; the key the recipient requests decryption if he wishes]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think this solves remailer resource objections.
&gt; 
&gt; yes, this sort of solves the storage problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Thinking how this might work...
&gt; 
&gt; Alice's remailer gets an e-mail for Bob.
&gt; 
&gt; Alice's remailer generates 2 pseudo-random numbers, K and L, and uses
&gt; K to encrypt the message with a symmetric cryptoscheme.
&gt; 
&gt; Alice's remailer sends the encrypted message and L to Bob with the
&gt; following note: if you want to receive the key to decrypt this
&gt; message, send back L and acknowledge the disclaimer.
&gt; 
&gt; Alice's remailer retains the triple (K,L,Bob). Because it's small,
&gt; it can be kept for a long time.

I think you don't need to keep Bob .. just lookup K with L.  Less
email addresses is a good thing.

The counter argument I suppose is that the Feds, or anyone else who
reads Bobs email can then ask for the key.  But if they can read his
email, they can already read it once he requests the key.  It would
allow an eavesdropper to do a DoS attack against Bob, request all his
emails before he can.

&gt; If Bob sends back L, the remailer sends Bob K so he can read his message.
&gt; 
&gt; I see a few problems with this. I'm sure it can be improved.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What if Bob is another remailer, unknown to Alice?

Why is this a problem?  You have accept lists for remailers between
themselves.  A private remailer (one not advertising itself on these
lists) just mimics Alice in retreiving the email ... waits a while
then requests the key.

&gt; 2. What if Bob doesn't have the program to decode his message? (It's
&gt; fair to assume that everyone can fine PGP. It's not fair to assume that
&gt; everyone can find e.g. triple DES.)

You can provide a web interface to do it for him.

Or, you can offer the option that if he includes the encrypted message
in his request you will decrypt it for him, by return of email.

&gt; 3. What if the LEA's decide that the collection of triples on Alice's
&gt; computer is worth looking at, for instance, for the list of addresses.
&gt; (OK, they could be encrypted probably.)

Don't keep the addresses as above -- treat the nonce L as the
identitiy.

&gt; 4. What if the LEA's decide to find out how K, L are generated?

Random pool like PGP, it's one way and the pool has more bits than the
key material the Feds have anyway.  /dev/urandom is nice.  

&gt; When Alice's remailer gets an e-mail for Bob, it should do
&gt; something like:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;           try to fetch Bob's public key
&gt;           from a well-run key server
&gt;             /                    \
&gt;          success               failure
&gt;            |                      |
&gt;       encrypt the e-mail      discard the
&gt;       with bob's key and      e-mail!
&gt;       pass it to Bob              |
&gt;                               was the form
&gt;                               letter sent to
&gt;                               Bob in the last
&gt;                               7 days?    \
&gt;                              /            no
&gt;                            yes              \
&gt;                           /                exit
&gt;                     send bob the
&gt;                     form letter
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Wow, isn't that a perry flow chart. :-)

Yes.  A good solution also.  Perhaps we can write a nice remailer
which has a web forms interface for configuration, lots of radio
buttons etc to allow the proud new remailer in a box owner to
configure his remailer, and pretty stats graphs.

[o] discard / keep
if keep how long for [...]

etc.

Then let the remailer operator play with settings and see which works
out best for him.

&gt; It may be hard to prove a negative to a LEO who doesn't know what
&gt; the hell you're talking about. You have a file in your spool that
&gt; was encrypted with a key that your program generated, but now you
&gt; no longer have the key? Well, tell us how the key was generated.

I think you're arguing for your discard all policy :-)

btw if you're interested to fix the keyserver so that it requires an
ack to a ping with a nonce, someone at MIT has a fast PGP key database
/ web key server which isn't using PGPs linear lookup.  You can find a
link to it from Brian LaMachia's keyserver page.

Another snazzy thing to do to the keyserver would be to have it obtain
a timestamp signature on your key (from a third party time stamping
service, of which there are several) and include that too.
