&gt; I will always remember reading a magazine piece by a fellow who
&gt; described the increasing persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany,
&gt; and the abuses to which he was himself subjected.
&gt; However, when describing the night when the jackboots kicked in
&gt; his door to take his family to the death camps, he begins his
&gt; account by saying, "They came without warning..."

Gosh, I feel bad whipping on one of the old/reliable/reputable
posters here, but, this seems to perfectly describe one T.C. May
and how he just couldn't believe what Sandy was doing, or that
Sandy would consider the c-punks' reputation to be expendable.

&gt; &gt; Check out the stiff who's pictured with Phil in the MicroTimes
&gt; &gt; current issue, his new partner or something.  Phil looks happy,
&gt; &gt; like they gave him a lifetime supply of double-stuff Oreos.

&gt; Are both of Phil's partner's arms in plain view, or is his partner
&gt; perhaps holding a gun on him?

I think someone else has a gun on both of them.  The "partner" is
wearing a badly-composed grin, but then he may have been pulled out
of the closet at the last moment for the photo, and the light could
be bothering him.

&gt; I agree with TruthMonger's position that the very fact of extreme
&gt; pressure being applied should be grounds for considering that perhaps
&gt; PGP might have been compromised at some level, no matter what an
&gt; analysis of the "numbers" shows, or one's faith in Philly Z.

Not only the software, but folks get lulled into complacency with
the "new, distributed" lists, thinking that since Gilmore/Sandfort
are "gone", everything is going to be OK from now on.

&gt; There seems to be some weakly thought out definition of 'paranoia'
&gt; going around which deems it to be the feeling you are supposed to get
&gt; when you hear the sound of the jackboots on your door. Excuse me for
&gt; disagreeing, but I believe the proper feeling at that point in time
&gt; may be resignation to your own death (and a firm resolve not to go
&gt; 'alone' into that dark night).

I have a Sid Vicious t-shirt that says "never let them take you
alive".  I really enjoyed the story of the Warsaw ghetto uprising
when I first heard it, and whereas Sid and the Warsaw dwellers are
from a different time and mindset, I think us modern folks can draw
the appropriate analogies.

&gt; Or, if your door is strong enough, you might have one last chance
&gt; to play "Hide the Salami" with Lady Byrd.

A gun in one hand and a babe in the other - what a privelege to be
an American!!  BTW, I saw an all-stainless Colt King Cobra .357
in a pawn shop the other day for $475.  Clean as a whistle.  I
snatched that puppy up real quick.  It would be my dying wish
to have some otherwise faceless bureaucrat be the recipient of
its intended use, should it come to that.

&gt; Someone suggested to me, in private email, that they would suspect
&gt; TruthMonger to be a Toto testicle, except for the lack of humor in
&gt; any of his posts. However, I couldn't help but notice that TruthMonger's
&gt; original post in this thread was a reply to a request for information in
&gt; regard to "Anonymous Nymserver at anon.nymserver.com", and a request for
&gt; an opinion as to the competence and integrity of those involved in its operation.

Exactly.  Now who would be taking an option on throwaways like that?

&gt; Neither could I help noticing that TruthMonger's reply, which had
&gt; mercilessly slammed both the integrity and motivations behind all
&gt; remailer operations, and which suggested that one unequivocally mistrust
&gt; all of them, was sent from the very anon-server in question.
&gt; Make of this what you will, but bear in mind that Hypocrisy and
&gt; Humor are not all that far apart in the dictionary.
