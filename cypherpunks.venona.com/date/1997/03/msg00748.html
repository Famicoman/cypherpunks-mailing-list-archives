Great news, Toto. 

The wisest people are already avoiding MS products and are using free
software like Linux to its fullest capacity.

Cc-ed to Bill Gates.

&gt; March 24, 1997
&gt; 
&gt;             Coda dependency may contribute to the fall of the
&gt;             great Gates empire
&gt; 
&gt;             Last week's column demonstrated that Microsoft is
&gt;             unable to respond to the network computer in its
&gt;             usual "co-opt the technology" manner -- a fact
&gt;             that may signal the turning point in the company's
&gt;             history. (Why am I leaving Intel out of this
&gt;             prediction, you ask? Because it is in a far more
&gt;             flexible position than Microsoft. Its chips can
&gt;             run anything. Microsoft needs them to run
&gt;             Windows.)
&gt; 
&gt;             Add to this NC threat the mounting troubles for
&gt;             Microsoft, and it's no wonder there's no joy in
&gt;             Redmond tonight.
&gt; 
&gt;             Look at the trends. According to International
&gt;             Data Corp., Microsoft SQL Server for Windows NT
&gt;             has been losing significant market share for two
&gt;             years to competing products that run on multiple
&gt;             platforms. Microsoft's Wolfpack clustering
&gt;             technology is turning out to be a Chihuahuapack.
&gt;             (See "Toothless Wolfpack," March 17.) Seemingly
&gt;             endless rapid-fire announcements by ISVs to
&gt;             support standards such as Java, JDBC, LDAP, IMAP4,
&gt;             and CORBA are shoving Microsoft's TAPI, MAPI,
&gt;             ISAPI, "SLAP-HAPI," and a host of other
&gt;             Microsoft-centric specifications right out of the
&gt;             limelight.
&gt; 
&gt;             By now you have undoubtedly heard more than you
&gt;             want to hear about the fellow in Germany who
&gt;             demonstrated that a malicious ActiveX control can
&gt;             secretly empty your bank account. Leaks, bugs, and
&gt;             hastily cobbled service packs have been drawing
&gt;             attention to the immaturity of Windows NT. And,
&gt;             most recently, college kids have found more holes
&gt;             in Internet Explorer than it takes to fill the
&gt;             Albert Hall. (My apologies to those outside the
&gt;             Beatles generation who don't get the reference.)
&gt; 
&gt;             Meanwhile, Microsoft has crushed or alienated
&gt;             practically every potential partner that might
&gt;             otherwise have helped it out of its current fix.
&gt; 
&gt;             Network hanky panky
&gt; 
&gt;             This latest Microsoft Internet Explorer security
&gt;             dustup really isn't a bug, it's a feature.
&gt;             Internet Explorer was built to make it easy to
&gt;             launch a file, whether that file is on your hard
&gt;             drive or sitting on a server somewhere in
&gt;             Freedonia. Unfortunately, it took someone outside
&gt;             Microsoft to realize last August that the file one
&gt;             launches from Explorer could be a Word for Windows
&gt;             document packing a malevolent macro.
&gt; 
&gt;             Then, in the past few weeks, .URL, .LNK, and .ISP
&gt;             files were added to the danger list. Then it
&gt;             surfaced that Microsoft's Common Internet File
&gt;             System opens the door to network hanky panky. This
&gt;             is clearly a company that isn't used to thinking
&gt;             outside of the universe of the local LAN. The
&gt;             Microsoft patches configure Explorer to ask your
&gt;             permission before launching a potentially
&gt;             dangerous file type (similar to Netscape
&gt;             Navigator). OK, but this solution makes it
&gt;             virtually impossible for Microsoft or anyone else
&gt;             to integrate a browser seamlessly into the Windows
&gt;             desktop.
&gt; 
&gt;             If seamless, safe desktop access to remote files
&gt;             on the Internet is the goal, Microsoft is spinning
&gt;             its wheels. There is really only one way to
&gt;             provide these features without introducing a local
&gt;             security risk. You have to eliminate the
&gt;             possibility that anything you run can affect your
&gt;             local drives. Better still, get rid of your local
&gt;             drives.
&gt; 
&gt;             In short, a Java-based browser is a good way to do
&gt;             it, but a Java-based network computer is best.
&gt;             Which brings us back to the conclusion of last
&gt;             week's column.
&gt; 
&gt;             But, if you're tired of the repetition, here's a
&gt;             reason you should sit through another sermon:
&gt;             RandomNoise's Coda. Coda lets you design entire
&gt;             Web pages in Java rather than use a mixture of
&gt;             HTML content, tags, and Java applets.
&gt; 
&gt;             Most pundits seem to be fixated on the fact that
&gt;             Coda gives you a way to display fancy fonts that
&gt;             HTML can't handle. Our own Bob Metcalfe is the
&gt;             only one I know of who addressed the bigger
&gt;             picture. (See From the Ether, March 10). He
&gt;             pointed out that Coda may lead the way toward
&gt;             replacing HTML with Java.
&gt; 
&gt;             A Java-based Web page removes the distinction
&gt;             between application and data. It presents data
&gt;             just as an HTML page would, but every element on
&gt;             the screen has the potential to be an interactive
&gt;             part of a sophisticated application.
&gt; 
&gt;             In other words, the Web page becomes both powerful
&gt;             and safe enough to earn the right to be the new
&gt;             desktop user interface to the world. But Internet
&gt;             Explorer and Windows are nowhere in that equation.
&gt; 
&gt;             So is Microsoft in a batting slump, or is this the
&gt;             beginning of the end? Personally, I think
&gt;             Microsoft can pull out of this one. All it would
&gt;             have to do to fully recover is turn Windows NT
&gt;             into Unix, drop Distributed Component Object Model
&gt;             for CORBA, phase out its Windows-centric protocols
&gt;             for platform-independent standards, adopt
&gt;             NetWare's Novell Directory Services, kill ActiveX,
&gt;             port SQL Server to several different platforms,
&gt;             and abandon the idea of integrating Internet
&gt;             Explorer into the desktop.
&gt; 
&gt;             Well, I'm going to take a nap. Wake me when all
&gt;             that happens.
&gt;
