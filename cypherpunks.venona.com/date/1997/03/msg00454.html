&gt;&gt; &gt;Suppose X chooses to innoculate their kids and Y chooses not to innoculate

&gt;&gt; &gt;give it to someone whose parents chose to innoculate them. (This is a kind
&gt;&gt; &gt;of borderline example, not unlike circumcision.  The individual affected
&gt;&gt; &gt;by the choice is too young to understand what it's all about, but doesn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;want to be stuck with a needle. Why are the parents more qualified to make
&gt;&gt; &gt;decisions for him than the state?)

&gt;&gt; The issue of who is more qualified is irrelevent.
&gt;&gt; The parents are the ONLY ones who have a right to determin the welfare of
&gt;&gt; their childern. If the parents determin that the risks of reaction to the
&gt;&gt; innoculation outways the benifits that choice is their's and their's alone.

&gt;I inherited three kids (9, 11, and 13) in November, and am starting to get
&gt;used to the schools' intrusions just now.  So far, I've prepared one form
&gt;for the kids to hand to the teacher when there is an off-campus trip
&gt;scheduled.  Like who's driving, are they certified by the school board,
&gt;chaperones (who are they), etc.

&gt;Recently they did a surprise dental inspection of the youngest kid. I'm
&gt;preparing a form to tell the schools that any certification they require
&gt;on the kids as to health, etc. will be provided by our doctors, not
&gt;theirs, so the kids can skip their inspections. So far I haven't met with
&gt;any serious opposition, but who knows?

&gt;(I'm informing them that I'm a Puritan, and follow very strict religious
&gt;practices)

&gt;Today's Long Beach paper had an extensive article on "pregnancy counciling
&gt;support groups" for sixth grade girls (in Santa Ana?), and the "support
&gt;groups" were mandatory. Religious fundamentalists are certain to hit the
&gt;ceiling on this one - not just the increase in sexual awareness aspect,
&gt;but the hoodoo-voodoo aspect of a "support" group that smacks of New Age
&gt;practices (their article, not mine).  According to the article, the groups
&gt;have an amazing record, i.e., pregnancies down by 80% or more among the
&gt;teenage girls.

Well the best way to aviod all this is to "Home School". In the end they
will get a much better education and they woun't turn out to be lock-step
robots for the STATE.

This requires a two parent home though (politically incorrect these days)
and a wife with a few brain cells. :)

The next best thing is a private school but even they are being corrupted
by all this touchy feely crap. Still better than sending them to the
STATE'S reeducation centers.
