1.   MMX Watch

Intel Pentium MMX ---&gt;  Available Now!

AMD K6 MMX ---&gt;  April

Intel Pentium Pro MMX (Pentium II/Klamath) ---&gt; May

Cyrix M2 180 &amp; 200 MHz MMX ---&gt;  July

Please remember that supplies will be very tight immediately
after release.  If you have an application now, don't wait!
Purchase the chip you need today and upgrade to MMX later
(especially when prices come down).

2.   A RIVER RUNS THROUGH "IT"

The Pentium Pro has been the processor of choice for networked
desktop computers running Windows NT.  But Intel is now about
to flood the Information Technology (IT) market with a river
of new processors.

Each of these chips provides a growth path for the Pentium Pro
and guarantees many years of technical improvement. However,
the Intel upgrade path requires - at a minumum - a Pentium Pro
motherboard or, preferably, a new "SEC" motherboard.

Interestingly, all the new chips have been given the same
names as rivers in Oregon: Klamath, Tillamook, Deschutes,
Katmai, Willamette and Merced.  Why has Intel done this?

The new chips are a joint design project involving Intel's
Hillsboro, Oregon facility, along with the Santa Clara, CA
headquarters. And the river that joins the Oregon/California
border is... the Klamath!

Since everything starts with the Pentium Pro, a quick note
about the existing microprocessor approach.  The current
Pentium Pro uses a dual-chip design that couples the CPU
(with its built-in L1 Cache) and the 256K secondary L2 cache
chip on a single die that plugs into a socket on the system
motherboard.  However, the new designs split the components
and places them on a single cartridge that plugs directly
into a motherboard.


KLAMATH
This is the Pentium Pro with MMX Technology, also known as
the "Pentium II".  This processor is the first of the P6
(too advanced to be called a 686) generation of CPUs.

The Klamath/Pentium II creates a major break with existing
chip and motherboard designs.  It incorporates all the basic
features of MMX: a larger Level 1 cache for fast data access,
plus the 57 new multimedia extensions.  Using a 0.35-micron
CMOS process, a larger die size is produced, but with lower
power consumption.  Accordingly, the motherboard voltage has
to be reduced.

Most importantly, the Klamath/Pentium Pro MMX design is quite
different than the previous Pentium Pro.  The separate CPU
(with built-in L1 Cache), and the L2 cache chip sits in a
metal and plastic encased card called a Single Edge Contact
(SEC) Cartridge.  The cartridge will plug into a slot on the
klamath-compatible motherboard.

Intel says future processor upgrades will become simpler
because of the separation of the components and ability to
configure individual CPU/L2 combinations into cartridges.

The Pentium MMX was only supposed to run at 166 MHz and 200
MHz.  But, in response to Cyrix's announcement of one of their
MMX compatible M2 chips running at 225 MHz, Intel decided to
make a faster 233 MHz Pentium MMX version.

However, the Pentium Pro MMX was supposed to run at the higher
233 MHz speed.  So Intel will release the Klamath/Pentium II
MMX at 233 MHz, 266 MHz and 300 MHz.

Intel will release a Klamath motherboard at the same time as
the chip.  And many of the independent motherboard makers are
working on Klamath-compatible designs that will be released
the same time as Intel's board.

Because of design changes, current Pentium Pro motherboards
will not be able to accept the new cartridges directly.
However, it is expected that Intel -and others- will release
a connector that will allow the SEC cards to fit on existing
Pentium-Pro motherboards.   


TILLAMOOK
This is the notebook version of the Pentium Pro MMX scheduled
for the Fall of this year.  The cartridge design will require
an overhaul of all portable motherboards, so this is Intel's
opportunity to attempt to corner the notebook motherboard
market.  The Intel motherboard "module" will consist of the
board, the MMX procesor, high-speed cache memory, a power
supply, and circuitry for controlling the PCI bus and memory.
In effect, with a prebuilt module, Intel will provide almost
everything necessary for computer manufacturers to produce
high-end notebooks.


DESCHUTES
To be introduced by the end of 1997 or early 1998, this is the
"shrink" notebook version of the Pentium Pro MMX.  The chip
will be manufactured with a new 0.25-micron process (about one
four-hundredth of a human hair) so that the chip will run 
faster (higher clock rates of 300 MHz to 333 MHz) but at a
lower voltage resulting in less heat.  Deschutes, will be
Intel's first chip to support a 100MHz CPU bus and 1MB cache.
That would be a measurable improvement over bus speeds on
current processors that peak at 66MHz. 


KATAMI
Multi-Media Extensions have just been introduced, but Intel
is already planning an enhanced instruction set and better
support for 3D graphics in this Spring 1998 version of the
Pentium Pro MMX.  Using the 0.25-micron process, Intel has
demonstrated a chip running at 451 megahertz.  The desktop
cartridge will also have a larger cache.


WILLAMETTE
A further improvement scheduled for late 1998, this Pentium
Pro MMX cartridge will offer more execution units and run on
a faster 100 MHz bus.  It will have a larger die size, but
will offer up to a 50% performance boost over Klamath.


MERCED
Developed in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard, this cartridge
won't be released until 1999.  It will be the first P7-family
microprocessor with 64-bit architecture.

3.   BUY ME A RIVER

The Klamath is actually available now.  But the chip has to be
placed in a Single Edge Contact (SEC) Cartridge. The cartridge
then plugs into a special slot on the motherboard.

Does your motherboard have a SEC slot?  If not, you may have
to buy a new motherboard to follow Intel's growth path.

However, do you have a Pentium Pro motherboard?  Intel says
that they are planning to release a special connector that
will permit the SEC to fit existing Pentium Pro motherboards.

Our suggestion...
Take a look at our Pentium Pro motherboards that provide an
excellent platform for future upgrades.  Then, when the SEC
connector is released, you'll be able to move on to the Intel
Klamath/Pentium II.

We strongly recommend the M Technology R622 motherboard. It 
has the Intel Natoma chipset, and it is a AT Form Facator.
