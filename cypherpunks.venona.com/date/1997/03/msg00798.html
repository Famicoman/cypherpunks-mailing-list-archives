&gt; &gt; That's a good idea, but it'll take up a lot of disk space at the
&gt; &gt; machine running the remailer.  Right now, remailers that provide
&gt; &gt; latency don't keep an e-mail for more than about 12 hours. Once
&gt; &gt; you start keeping them around for a few days (a reasonable grace
&gt; &gt; period for a first-time user), it's a lot more disk space.
&gt;
&gt; 	How 'bout this:
&gt;
&gt; 	There is (as we all know) a newsgroup for anonymous messages, Simply
&gt; encrypt the message with one half of a public key pair, and send the other
&gt; to the individual with a message saying that there is a message waiting
&gt; for you on alt.anonymous.messages with a subject of ^CHojnafy&amp;Ys9. This is
&gt; the key to decrypt the first level. If you do not have access to usenet,
&gt; you can get the message from www.dejanews.com &amp;etc.

I don't like this for only one reason: you'll be wasting disk
space at thousands of usenet sites. I happen to think that alt.anonymous.
messages is a really wasteful communications channel. If it were used for
all the traffic now caried by the remailers, many syadmins would stop
carrying it (a lot of useless traffic). I would have if I had carried it. :-)

Also it's not fair to assume that everyone with access to e-mail can
also get web or usenet. One example that's still fairly common in a
user on a corporate computer behind a firewall.

&gt; 	The encryption by the endpoint remailer is not intended to
&gt; supply complete privacy, but rather to provide an additional level of
&gt; protection for those who don't encrypt to begin with.

If the key is generated by the remailer, then a LEA might go on a fishing
expedition trying to figure how the key was generated and whether they can
generate the same key again. It's safer not to generate random keys.

&gt; 	This has the benefit of (1) not dumping the email into a persons
&gt; mail box, so they don't get "spam" they don't want. (2) getting possibly
&gt; illegal material off the remailer machine as quickly as possible (well,
&gt; off the remailer portion anyway, if the news spool is on the same machine,
&gt; that is a different legal battle) and (3) disassocating the sender and
&gt; receiver a little more.

These are all good things; I just wish they could be accomplished in a less
wasteful manner.  To replicate a file at thousands of usenet servers which
can only be decrypted by one person is, in my opinion, selfish net-abuse.
