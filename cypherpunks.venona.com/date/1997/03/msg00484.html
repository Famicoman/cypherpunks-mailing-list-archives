&gt; Subject: Cocksucker John Gilmore attempts to rewrite history again
&gt; 
&gt; I've been reading a thread in the Usenet newsgroups alt.cypherpunks and
&gt; comp.org.eff.talk. EFF, you may recall, is Cocksucker John Gilmore's setup,
&gt; and a pair of Gilmore/EFF's stooges - llurch@quixote.stanford.edu (Rich
&gt; Graves &lt;rcgraves@disposable.com&gt;) and sethf@athena.mit.edu (Seth
&gt; Finkelstein) - have been posting lies in an effort to rewrite the recent
&gt; events which have totally destroyed Cocksucker's reputation on the net.
&gt; 
&gt; Rich Graves wrote in article &lt;5gl63i$4eu@quixote.stanford.edu&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;comparing me to Vulis doesn't work, I don't think. He'd have
&gt; &gt;mailbombed the list subscribers at the drop of a hat; and in
&gt; &gt;the case of cypherpunks, he and GruBoursy did, to such an
&gt; &gt;extent that the list had to move from toad.com to cyberpass.net.
&gt; &gt;I'm sure I've disappointed some people by doing nothing of the
&gt; &gt;kind. Doesn't stop Seth from saying I'm obsessed, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a lie. I haven't mailbombed cypherpunks. The list moved from
&gt; toad.com to multiple sites because the readers no longer trusted Gilmore to
&gt; host the list. In article &lt;5gkfag$36o@quixote.stanford.edu&gt; he also wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;In any case, I personally would not ever absolutely reject posts
&gt; &gt;&gt;arbitrarily from someone if I was moderating a list, even if 99.9% of
&gt; &gt;&gt;their posts were absolute junk.  (I've been in such situations---try
&gt; &gt;&gt;moderating an biological evolution newsgroup and fend of all the
&gt; &gt;&gt;creationists.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You've never met Dr. Vulis, then. Imagine 50 messages a day like this:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Rich is lying...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Vulis also posted megabytes of Serdar Argic screeds, just to be annoying,
&gt; &gt;and with the stated intention of disrupting the list. That's called a
&gt; &gt;denial of service attack.
&gt; 
&gt; More lies. I haven't posted megabytes of Serdar Argic materials, and I have
&gt; repeatedly stated that it is NOT my intention to disrupt the mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;While the cypherpunks move from toad.com to cyberpass.net was far from
&gt; &gt;ideal, it worked reasonably well because the list was aware of what was
&gt; &gt;happening.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that why John Gilmore is sending his minions to post lies and to
&gt; confuse the readers about what was happening?
&gt; 
&gt; In response, sethf@athena.mit.edu (Seth Finkelstein) further wrote
&gt; in article &lt;5gmnuj$1ha@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In any case, I personally would not ever absolutely reject posts
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;arbitrarily from someone if I was moderating a list, even if 99.9% of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;their posts were absolute junk.  (I've been in such situations---try
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	Yes, Ram, I know you'd likely handle such a situation differently.
&gt; &gt;But as I keep saying, on a human level, I just can't work up any
&gt; &gt;criticism for Declan for not wanting to deal in any way shape or
&gt; &gt;form with a person who so frequently mudslings and smears him so much.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, this is not true. I disagree with many of the things Declan says, but
&gt; I'm not smearing him and not slinging mud at him. I'm also not aware of
&gt; having being banned from any forum Declan moderates, whatever that is.
&gt; 
&gt; Seth further has the audacity to praise John Gilmore for showing the
&gt; "patience of a saint":
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	It wasn't up to Vulis level, absolutely. But I think taking
&gt; &gt;the junk from Vulis showed the patience of a saint.
&gt; 
&gt; This is actually very funny.
