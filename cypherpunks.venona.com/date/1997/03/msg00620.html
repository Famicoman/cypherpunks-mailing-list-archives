&gt;Subject: [PGP-USERS] *** THE HAYSTACK REMAILER IS GONE ***
&gt;
&gt;Hi all-
&gt;
&gt;	Here's another one from this week (in addition to jpunix). They are
&gt;dropping like flies, unfortunately.
&gt;
&gt;	Boy, this really, really stinks.
&gt;
&gt;	Fred
&gt;==========================================================================
&gt;
&gt;   *** IMPORTANT NEWS REGARDING HAYSTACK@HOLY.COW.NET ***
&gt;
&gt; The Bovine Remailer, also known as haystack@holy.cow.net, is
&gt; hereby CLOSED. Mail sent to that address will bounce; I don't
&gt; know on a technical basis what putting it in the middle of a
&gt; remailer chain will do. There are no other remailers or anon
&gt; services associated with cow.net.
&gt;
&gt; It has been a fun year, but the simple fact is that running
&gt; a remailer is a thankless, embittering, nasty job. For every
&gt; success story of alternate or persecuted viewpoints seeing
&gt; the light of day, there are another four or five cases of
&gt; legal threats, use of the remailer to spam people who have
&gt; already turned off access to their accounts from other sources,
&gt; and the extremely disturbing trend of posting newsgroups
&gt; with falsified From: Headers, intending to cause endless spam
&gt; bots to mail the forged address. No one carefully put in a
&gt; forged address to endanger or misrepresent another person, 
&gt; but it was only a matter of time.
&gt;
&gt; Haystack was running on a Sun 3/280 at the cow.net loft. At
&gt; the peak, this machine was recieving over one thousand 
&gt; e-mails a day, doing PGP calculations, and sending them out,
&gt; and the 30mhz processor wasn't up to the task. The final
&gt; straw was the use of the remailer to send out several 
&gt; hundred "MAKE MONEY FAST"-style messages to a group of 
&gt; folks who then rebelled or retaliated to the remailer itself;
&gt; everyone associated in this sucks. 
&gt;
&gt; If you think this is a shame, then put up your own remailer;
&gt; no doubt you'll have a thicker skin that the admins of
&gt; haystack, and will somehow flourish under the increasingly
&gt; fascist and overbearing environment of the Internet, but
&gt; the games up here, for now.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, for now. We might return some time in the future,
&gt; should technical and financial issues be solved, but it seems
&gt; rather unlikely at this juncture.
&gt;
&gt; Once again, if you enjoyed using haystack, you might consider
&gt; fighting the good fight and putting up your own. A good,
&gt; solid increase in remailers might save the culture. It is
&gt; nearly a crime that so much perfectly powerful computer
&gt; hardware exists out there, hooked to the net, and a mere
&gt; dozen computers, in our case quite aged, were/are doing the
&gt; remailing work.
&gt;
&gt; So, well, like we said, it's been a blast. See you later.
&gt; Moo.
&gt;
&gt; - The Haystack Administration.

&gt;	Although in theory, there's no difference between 
&gt;	theory and practice, in practice, there is.
