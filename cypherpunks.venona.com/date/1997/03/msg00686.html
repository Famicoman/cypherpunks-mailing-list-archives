&gt; I think there are two broad models of complaints/problems with remailers:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The recipient is angry because they received a message they didn't like.
&gt; (because it's an advertisement, or it's rude, or it's an image that their
&gt; parents didn't like ..) 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A third party is angry because the sender sent some information to the
&gt; recipient which the third party thinks should not have been sent. (copyright,
&gt; trademark, defamation, tortious interference with [prospective] contract,
&gt; etc.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Your "contract" model (which looks like you really mean it to be a waiver of
&gt; warranty/damages and/or an indemnification agreement) addresses (1) to the
&gt; point of overkill, but it doesn't reach (2), because there's no contract with
&gt; the third party, who is the party who's likely to be filing suit.
&gt; (Indemnification by the sender might work, if you worded the contract
&gt; correctly - but then you've got to abandon anonymity, and the value of
&gt; indemnification from person you don't know whose assets/finances are unknown
&gt; is pretty low.)
&lt;snip&gt;

Does anyone here actually know the requirements for common carrier
status? (A web search proved mostly uniformative, except that now I
know that Ohio University offers a course in CC Regualtions.) While my
intuitive notion of what a CC is does mean that ISP's are not good
CC's (ISP's want to not carry every newsgroup, want to not let people
have accounts for any old reason, etc), remailers seem like a perfect
candidate. For example, you could have a remailer that has one simple
rule: they only allow 10 messages a day from people who aren't other
anon. remailers. That way, the system isn't rejecting any traffic
"unreasonably," and gains some legal protection. If someone form, say,
a praticularly profitable religous institution calls up and says "We
belive that certain copywritten internal documets were sent through
your remailer." You say "Sorry, dude, I just pass the messages along."


I imagine that there would be problems keeping messages anonymous ir
regards to the feds, as I imagine that there would be some analogy to
phone taps, but legal protection from civilians is a step in the right
direction, and a few remailers in civilized jurisdictions would make
the feds' lives difficult.
