It's nice to see that the clueful memes are spreading, Gilder's congenital
statism aside :-).

Also from <A  HREF="http://www.computer.org/internet/9701/gilder9701.htm">http://www.computer.org/internet/9701/gilder9701.htm</A> .



&gt; Petrie: While we're on the subject of choice, what do you think about the
&gt; First Amendment issues currently before the Supreme Court concerning the
&gt; use of legislation to block the viewing of pornography on the Internet?
&gt;
&gt; Gilder: My belief is that you don't have to change the laws to deal with
&gt; the child pornography or snuff films or other extreme cases that are
&gt; employed to justify sweeping regulation of the Net. I think they're a
&gt; distraction, they're a red herring. My 12-year-old son is on the Net all
&gt; the time and I'm eager for the evolution of techniques applicable at the
&gt; terminal to lock out certain domains of the Internet to children. But I
&gt; think that porn of sufficiently revolting character is widespread all over
&gt; the society. If the politicians want to crack down, how about the
&gt; Spectravision boxes in every hotel room?
&gt;
&gt; To focus on the Internet bespeaks another agenda. And I don't
&gt; approve of the other agenda, which is to control this new communication
&gt; system, because the way they controlled the old one has been a disaster--it
&gt; has greatly slowed the extension of bandwidth and led to this kind of
&gt; optical illusion, or nonoptical illusion, that bandwidth is somehow scarce
&gt; and difficult to create.
&gt;
&gt; Petrie: This also reminds me of the paranoia about security on the
&gt; Internet. For example, online banking on the Internet requires you to have
&gt; a US-grade security browser, a user ID, and a password to access the same
&gt; service you can use three digits to access by telephone.
&gt;
&gt; Gilder: I completely agree with that observation. There is a paranoid note
&gt; in this encryption and privacy issue. But I think corporations do have a
&gt; real problem. If you're sending billions of dollars of value across the
&gt; Net, you've created a huge incentive for people to break your codes and
&gt; skim off some small proportion of your value flow.
&gt;
&gt; Petrie: But we're not talking about financial transactions. Those have been
&gt; secured for quite some time.
&gt;
&gt; Gilder: But how? They're using the DES (data encryption standard) algorithm
&gt; which is a fairly low level of encryption employed by banks for
&gt; transmitting funds. I know it works--I really don't agree with the thesis
&gt; that the Internet is insecure--however, I'm willing to imagine there are
&gt; applications where you want more security than currently exists. But we are
&gt; talking about a lot of issues here all at once. The encryption issue about
&gt; terrorism, for example. Banning strong encryption in order to thwart
&gt; terrorists means that only terrorists will have strong encryption. I really
&gt; think that's accurate--or at least only foreign countries will be able to
&gt; have encryption. So the encryption technology will tend to move overseas
&gt; where it's completely beyond the reach of US security.
&gt;
&gt; I think the government's going to figure out that they want the best
&gt; encryption to be American. And to disagree with the current wisdom, there
&gt; is an arms race. The arms race is with the terrorists. There's no question
&gt; about it. But there is no quick technical fix for this arms race. The
&gt; government has to understand this is a dynamic rather than a static arms
&gt; race, and you won't be able to solve the problem by treaty. The problem is
&gt; that of evil in the world, and it's something all of us, including people
&gt; who want a wild and woolly Internet, depend on our government to address.
