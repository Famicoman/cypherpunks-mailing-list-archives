Alexis and Jonathan were resting in each other's arms on the couch by the
old oak table, and quietly discussing the wide variety of posts to the
CypherPunks mailing lists in the wake of the House Commerce Committee's
defeat of the Oxley amendment to the SAFE bill and their approval of the
Markey-White amendment, instead.

"It seems strange that the our future destiny is so deeply intertwined with
events that happened over a century ago." Alexis said.
"It seems even stranger," she continued, "that our past is being
transmogrified through the InformEnergy we are exchanging with that era
through the Trei Transponder."

"Not to mention the present…" Jonathan added, showing her the post he had
just pulled up on the GraphiScreen behind them.

Subject: FWD: Dear Representative Oxley
From: Anthony Garcia &lt;agarcia@Starbase.NeoSoft.COM&gt;
To: cypherpunks@Algebra.COM

For what it's worth. -Anthony

Date: Wed, 24 Sep 1997 17:47:37 -0500 (CDT)
From: Anthony Garcia &lt;agarcia@Starbase.NeoSoft.COM&gt;
To: Mike.Oxley@mail.house.gov
Subject: Dear Representative Oxley

At this time, it looks like your ignorant, anti-Constitutional
amendment to the Safety And Freedom through Encryption Act will be
passed by the Commerce Committee. This legislation may go on to
be passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.

In case this occurs, I would like you to make note of my home
address and telephone number. They are:
Anthony Garcia
[address &amp; phone elided for broadcast on cypherpunks list]

If I move to a new address in the future, I will update you.

I telling you this because I fully intend to willfully break
your stupid law exactly 1 minute after the moment it goes into
effect on January 1st, 1999.

I will:
- Manufacture an encryption product that does not support key
escrow (I will compile source code for encryption software
which does not support key escrow.)
- Offer to sell that encryption product to any takers for
the sum of $1.
- Offer that encryption product for free to the public via FTP or HTTP
file transfer over the Internet.
- Import an encryption software product which does not support
key escrow by means of file transfer over the Internet from
a foreign source.

So, get ready to arrest me, Big Mike. Get out your old FBI shield and
shine it up, because I AM GOING TO BREAK YOUR LAW. GOT IT?

Sincerely,
-Anthony Garcia
agarcia@neosoft.com

P.S. When you have some free time, look up a document known as the
"Bill of Rights", and review the sections titled "First Amendment" and
"Fourth Amendment".

Alexis gazed at the post with interest, but seemed mystified as to what
import it had for the Magic Circle's present situation.
"I don't remember seeing this post in the archives we went over yesterday,
but it certainly doesn't to seem unusual for the CypherPunks list."

"It wasn't in the mailing list archives yesterday." Jonathan told her,
waiting for the import of what he was saying to begin sinking in, as
evidenced by Alexis's ever-widening eyes, before continuing.
"All of the posts that were in the archive yesterday are either nonexistent,
or changed, when compared to emails we're pulling from A Player To Be Named
Later's digital implant through the Trei Transponder."

Bubba and Priscilla walked up, hand in hand, joining in the conversation.
"If you check the archives you will find," Bubba said solemnly, "that the
Oxley amendment to the SAFE bill passed on September 14, 1997."
After taking a sharp elbow to the ribs, Bubba added, grinning, "We have
Priscilla to thank for pointing out this most interesting anomaly in the
fabric of history, as we seem to currently be experiencing it."

"Bubba told me I was confused." Priscilla said, gloating at her correcting
of the Magic Circle's most prestigious purveyor of ancient history.
"He said that I must have read in the CypherPunks list archives about the
Oxley amendment being passed at a later date, since it had been one of the
turning points in history in the battle for control of the InterNet. I told
the old fart," Priscilla said, as Bubba now nudged her in the ribs,
"to…'check the archives.'"
Jonathan and Alexis laughed at her imitation of Tim May, circa. 1990's.

"Nuke DC!" the Cowboy approached, waving a handful of freshly printed posts
from their current subscription to the CypherPunks mailing list of a century
earlier.
The Cowboy had resurrected some old printers that Melissa had smuggled out
to him from the closely guarded Museum of Antiquities. d'Shauneaux had
brought them back from one of his midnight meetings with her the previous
week.

On Wed, 24 Sep 1997, Tim May wrote:

Erm, Tim you've somehow managed to misspell SODOMY. There's no securiy in
SAFE, by definition, it's a security hole through which the citizens get
sodomized.

======================= <A  HREF="http://www.sundernet.com">http://www.sundernet.com</A> ==========================

The Cowboy announced, grandly, "There is no record in the archives which
shows any indication that the SAFE bill became generally known on the
CypherPunks list as the 'Sodomy And Fascism through Encryption' bill, as now
seem to be happening."

The Cowboy showed the group a color printout of the new SAFE T-shirt being
produced by Adam Back, with a Swastika and the word 'SAFE' composed of a
series of toilet plungers.
"Bill Stewart suggested to Adam that it be a 'scratch and sniff' T-shirt,
but Back pointed out to him that SAFE was already beginning to smell bad to
an increasing number of people, anyway."

The small group shared a chuckle or two, as the Cowboy continued.
"In addition to the challenge issued to Oxley by Anthony Garcia, and the
posts by May and Arachelian, which didn't exist in our recent previous
past…if that makes sense…I have found that even the posts that do exist in
the archives are not the same as the ones we are currently receiving from
that same point in time.
"There has been a subtle quantum shift in the tone and direction of the
posts to the CypherPunks list, as well as to the rest of the history
surrounding the InterNet during that crucial nadir point in the InterNet's
evolution."

The Cowboy pulled out a bottle of Jim Beam and passed it around the table…an
indication that he was about to drop a bombshell on his compatriots. After
everyone had downed a stiff shot of the ice-cold bourbon, he asked, "What
did we all agree were two serious errors in Chapter 20 of 'InfoWar.'" he
asked the others.

Alexis was the first to speak.
"Well, in general, we agreed that it was a ridiculously overdone parody of a
conspiracy theory worthy of ? the Lunatic's deranged mind."

"In specific," Jonathan added, as the group laughed, once again,
"attributing the chapter as being written by Bill Gates, wherein the man
purportedly connects himself to one of the sleaziest maneuvers in the
history of the perversion of democracy and justice, then proceeding to make
it look as if he had cowardly submitted to blackmail by the anonymous post
that linked him to the original Indio gathering of weapons dealers, as well
as the thinly veiled threat of violence to 'a billionaire to be named
later.'
"Not even the most unbalanced of the CypherPunks list members was likely to
fail to see this as a shallow attempt at smearing Gates by making it look as
if he had taken up the challenge that ? the Lunatic had sent anonymously
through the TruthMailer as A. Fiend, to write his own chapter of 'InfoWar,'
revealing some dark secret from his past, and asking him to provide some
real, but improbable evidence of his authorship by making reference to some
future event, based on his own inside information."

The group nodded in agreement with this statement by Jonathan, and then
Alexis brought up the second major inanity the group had found in the
'InfoWar' chapter titled, 'A Billionaire To Be Named Later.'

"We agreed that it was a pretty wild stretch to intimate that an LMBoyd
sampler sent out two months before was a veiled message from the Circle of
Eunuchs to the Internet Content Coalition warning them of a serial
killer/mass murderer from the north, where ? the Lunatic and polar bears
live.
"Although the timing of the mentioned email was rather synchronous with the
Coalition's agenda..."

The Cowboy broke into a wide smile, asking the others, "Did anyone happen to
read the LMBoyd sampler for July 25, 1997?"
The others looked at one another questioningly, each nodding negatively.

The Cowboy lay a post in front of the group, which they proceeded to read
with amazement.

Subject: Sampler: September 25
Date: Thu, 25 Sep 1997 00:15:01 -0700
From: sampler-request@lmboyd.com
To: multiple recipients of &lt;sampler@lmboyd.com&gt;
======================================================

Tennis players might quote Shakespeare's Henry VI: "O
monstrous fault!" Basketball players, Henry V: "Hear the
shrill whistle." Bowlers, The Tempest: "Mercy on us, we
split." Golfers, King John: "Give me an iron." Baseball
players, Othello: "You did bid me steal." Hockey players,
A Midsummer Night's Dream: "Gentle Puck, come hither."

Great horned owls lay round eggs.

  1. Did the Eskimo of old believe in God?
     A. They did. They thought God, the Supreme
     Environmentalist, created polar bears to prevent humans
     from over-multiplying. So they wouldn't eat up everything
     in one season.

"This was sent out after chapter 20 of 'InfoWar' had been sent to the
CypherPunks list." Bubba commented.
After checking the date and time that chapter 20 had been sent, he said,
sounding even more perplexed and amazed, "A little more than a single hour
afterward."

The Cowboy let each of them read the post, once again, to confirm for
themselves what secrets it revealed.

"Fucking unbelievable!" Jonathan exclaimed.
"The 'A Billionaire To Be Named Later' chapter is not only followed shortly
thereafter by a completely unrelated item which contains not only a
confirmation of the claim of Circle of Eunuchs involvement in the LMBoyd web
site, but even expands on it, by adding the reference to hockey players,
such as the Author, as well as a repetition of the theme wherein polar bears
hunt and consume humans."

"And adding a reference to 'horned owls' dropping 'round eggs'?" Alexis
noted, looking at the others for confirmation she wasn't imagining things.
"Nukes?"

Bubba Rom Dos, poet and philosopher, also pointed out that the LMBoyd
sampler began with a reference to Shakespeare, and that the last quote
attributed to A Player To Be Named Later in the chapter attributed to Gates
was a reference to Shakespeare being a member of the Magic Circle-a distinct
impossibility.
"Thus, the author of chapter 20 could only have been using that analogy to
set up the confirmation by the later LMBoyd sampler that the Circle of
Eunuchs was involved in the use of the samplers to pass messages.

Jonathan asked the question that everyone was now rolling over in their
mind.
"What does this do to our other conclusion, that the chapter was not
authored by 'Bad BillyG,' himself?"

The Cowboy sat down and knocked back another shot of Jim Beam, as the Trei
Transponder began to quietly hum in the background. It was causing something
tucked away in the back of the Cowboy's mind to begin resonating, and he
struggled to bring it to the forefront of his consciousness where it could
be examined in the light of reason…

"A Player To Be Named Later had no connection to the LMBoyd web site." the
Cowboy stated emphatically, surprising the others, who were lost in their
own contemplation.

The Cowboy looked at each of the others, in turn, and announced, "But Gates
did!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Player To Be Named Later lay on his bed, Baby lying by his side and
looking up quizzically at him, wondering about the soft humming noise coming
from her friend's head. He reached down and stroked her on the back of the
neck, saying,
"Modern technology, Baby. Someday I'll get you a digital implant, too, so
that you can bark at the doggies of the future."

He laughed and rose to get Baby a bowl of milk.

BillyG had done his homework, that much was certain. And the man had added
some personal touches to chapter 20 of 'InfoWar' that would have done
justice to even the most diabolically astute members of the legendarily
insane conspiracy of the slippery, esoteric--and definitely mythical--Circle
of Eunuchs.

He had immediately noticed BillyG's reference to the Shakespeare line from
the first sentence of the last chapter of "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre."
Having the quote, "And one man, in his time, plays many parts." spoken by A
Player To Be Named Later was an obvious implication that he and the Author
were one and the same person. Keeping the 'true identity' of the Author 'in
play,' as Bubba called it, was a Circle of Eunuchs tradition.

As well, the last chapter of TXCSM, titled 'it ain't over 'till it's over,'
contained a reference to the "He who shits on the Road will meet flies on
his return." quote, which was a usual part of the TruthMailer header, but
was not included in the TruthMailer email which had originally challenged
BillyG to write a chapter for 'InfoWar.'
That TXCSM chapter also made reference to Pearl Harbor Computers motto,
"We've been bombed since 1941.", which meant that the Magic Circle had been
brought full circle to closure by the veiled reference to the nuclear bomb
in the follow-up LMBoyd sampler which served to confirm the details of the
chapter 20 reference to a previous LMBoyd sampler.

"And the ending of the second sampler," he told Baby, who was listening
intently, "with a direct reference to the polar bears mentioned in the one
from two months before…a fucking classic in-your-face Circle of Eunuchs
maneuver that says everything and proves nothing!"

The timing of the confirmation post was likewise a classic maneuver. Anyone
who went to the trouble of checking the timing of chapter 20 and the
following LMBoyd sampler could easily miscalculate different time zones
involved and come to the conclusion that it was a clever ruse, but those who
were familiar with headers and time zone references in InterNet processing
would know beyond doubt that chapter 20 had been submitted to the list
previous to the release of the LMBoyd sampler.

The Coupe de Gras, of course, was that chapter 21 of 'InfoWar,' which was
titled 'Lying Fucking Nazi Cunt Sex Criminal,' and which had its authorship
attributed to the President, quoted another email which had been posted to
the CypherPunks list before the House Commerce Committee's meeting on the
Oxley amendment to SAFE, as well as sent to over a hundred Congressmen and
Senators, and which alluded to an argument that would be raised during the
closed meeting-a fact which would be later confirmed by those in attendance.

The chapter itself intimated that this precognition of a later event might
be attributable to guessing the probable from previously available
information, even if it was a bold long-shot, but anyone who understood the
full import of the reference to the 'Forever Young' Eternity Server and the
demise of the Huge Cajones remailer would know beyond doubt that the author
of chapter 21 had access to information that came from deep within the walls
of the Whitehouse.

The ending of chapter 21 with the reference to the coming assault on Intel
might be viewed as information that could have leaked out before chapter 21
was written, but anyone who reread the passage a month or so in the future
would see the reality of what was being implied in the description of the
true agenda of 'total information control' being pursued by the dark powers
within the Whitehouse and the government intelligence agencies pulling the
President's strings.

"Two perfect chapters, Baby." A Player To Be Named Later knocked back a shot
of Scotch and rolled himself a cigarette.

"Anybody who checks the true facts involved in their creation and
distribution will prove to themselves, beyond all doubt, that their
authorship and their wild-eyed claims are exactly what the manuscript
purports them to be."
He laughed and threw Baby a chocolate chip cookie in appreciation of her
rapt attention to his maniacal monologue, and gave her a conspiratorial
wink.

"Yet," he continued, "just let them try to tell someone else of their
discovery…they will find them self running from the men with the butterfly
nets, in short order."

"But," A Player To Be Named Later continued, laughing diabolically, "they
ain't seen nothing, yet!"
