    and, of course, we all know that our friendLY, loyal, trustworthy,
    and obedient police departments can keep a secret and protect the
    innocent.

    NYT lead article today indicates Clinton bowing to LEOs to:

        ...gain broad access to patients' medical records, with hardly 
        any restrictions on use or redisclosure of the data.   

        "We recommend that providers and payers be permitted to rely on 
        the statement of law-enforcement officials that an inquiry meets 
        these standards," the administration says....

    and we all know the police never lie when theY're fishing!

        The administration proposal would not require law-enforcement 
        agencies to get court orders or to notify patients when they 
        seek medical records. Patients would not be assured of an 
        opportunity to challenge the disclosure of their files, though 
        the records could later be used against them in investigations 
        or prosecutions. 
    
    fourth amendment mean _anything_ to these petty dictators? has the
    US become just another bananna republic at the interest of the 
    power brokers?  are we stretching the idea of a republic a bit
    thin?

        "Our recommendations accommodate the interests of law     
        enforcement rather well," said an administration official who 
        helped draft the proposal. "The Justice Department got almost 
        everything it wanted." 

    THIS is what is wrong with the US! the courts have become 
    adversarial playgrounds for the prosecutors for the benefit of the 
    "state"  the old rule used to be if you were _charged_ by the Feds, 
    start plea bargaining --if you go to court, the sentence will 
    triple. just "fuck" the concept of innocent until proven guilty, or
    'hey, man, you were arrested, weren't you?'

        Andrew Fois, an assistant attorney general, said, "There has 
        been no documented history suggesting that law-enforcement 
        agencies have abused their current access to medical records, or 
        that existing federal and state law is inadequate to guard 
        against such a danger." 

    LIAR!  I'll bet this man would lie to his own mother if it meant
    his courtroom body count ratio increased. What state or federal 
    law? there is no restriction to LEO access currently; Congress is
    considering bills on protecting access, and the LEOs want total
    exemption from the rules.

    TIME FOR THE INTERMOUNTAIN EMPIRE TO SECEDE FROM THE 
    UNCONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON.
