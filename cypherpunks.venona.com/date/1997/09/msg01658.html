No wonder that lying forger Declan is friends with the lying psychopath
Charles Platt.  Declan, you threatened to post the transcript of my
interview - please go ahead, so everyone can confirm that you forged
quotes from me.

Okay, Vulis, that's it, you have made an explicit threat in a public
forum, I know where you live, I know your phone number, in fact I once
spoke to you on the phone, and I will be suggesting to the rather slow
witted people at my local police precinct that you have already
demonstrated unstable, threatening behavior toward many people, giving me
good reason to believe that you are capable of assault.

This is the last you will hear from me online. Anything further will be
stated in person.

I suggest an enhancement to the basic phone-torture scenario. Buy a cheap
answering machine that picks up on the third or fourth ring. Inside the
answering machine there is usually a relay that closes when the machine
picks up. It might be interesting to adapt that relay to supply an
electric shock to the slave. Thus, the slave gets to sit and listen as the
phone rings once, twice, a third time ... and of course, sometimes the
master hangs up BEFORE the fourth ring, just to make life more
interesting.

It seems to me, true torture has to entail anticipation and uncertainty.

Trouble is, in the long term this tends to result in enlargement of the
prostate. Of course that can be a torture in itself (urinary problems etc)
and I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, but at least the victim should be
aware of these potential long-term penalties.

&gt; BTW, I always thought that the telephone ringing signal was 20Hz AC, not
&gt; DC.

You're right, the ring signal is AC. Old phones used a rectifier that
would pass the AC and ring the bell. When the ringing signal is not
present, there is a DC potential on the line. This isn't painful but the
AC ring signal does, er, give you a shock.

This doesn't have much to do with torture, does it? Unless, of course,
you regard boredom as a form of torture. "Tonight, my dear, I am going to
tie you down--and read interesting facts about the TELEPHONE SYSTEM!"

&gt; How will this tell me how to effectively use this device?
&gt; I'm still looking for practical data.
&gt; Anybody ever use one of these things?

All I can tell you is I used to fool around with one of these things, as a
kid, with a friend. As kids, we took turns with one person turning the
handle while the other took a wire in each hand. As an adult, I would say
this is definitely not such a great idea. I find it hard to believe,
however, that you're going to do any harm if the two (dry) conductors
touch (dry) skin just a few inches apart. As a previous post said, avoid
running current through major organs (heart, brain, etc!).

A previous post gave various resistance values for skin. If you want to
know how much current the generator will pass through skin, first obtain a
potentiometer (variable resistor) that can take a reasonable amount of
current--1 watt, say. Use a volt/amp/ohm meter to calibrate the
potentiometer--i.e. mark where the knob points for 1000 ohms, 5000 ohms,
etc. Now attach one wire from your generator to one side of the
potentiometer, link the other side of your potentiometer with your
volt/amp/ohm meter, switch the meter to measure CURRENT (amps), and attach
the other side of the meter to the other wire of your generator. In other
words, the generator, potentiometer, and meter form a closed daisy chain.
Crank the handle at different potentiometer settings and see what readings
you get from your meter. This will only be an APPROXIMATE guide, and you
may want to check the skin resistance of your actual test subject too.

Note: all the above advice dates back to stuff I did 25 years ago. I think
it's accurate (if it's not, someone will probably flame me anyway); but
as with all forms of consensual torture, it might be a good idea to try it
on yourself first.
