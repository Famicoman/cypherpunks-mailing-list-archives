&gt;Subject: 	Soldiers
&gt;
&gt;Is there a small country that a thousand of us could go to and get 
&gt;citizenship and then have the country declare war on the U.S. after
&gt;we are all back in the country?
&gt;If a thousand of us could kill as many people as we could until we got
&gt;caught, then we could kill a lot of people who are bad for the country
&gt;and then once we're all caught the small country could surrender and
&gt;we would all have to be released as prisoners of war, right?
&gt;We could all be privates. They can't blame privates because they have
&gt;to follow orders.
&gt;The guys in the small country could make old guys who were dying soon
&gt;the leaders, and then when it was time to quit, they could overthrow
&gt;them and get US government aid. They could set the old guys trial dates
&gt;for two years down the road and then send them home to die.
&gt;I saw a guy get killed once and they told the guy who killed him that
&gt;he shouldn'a done it and they sent him home and said we'll call you
&gt;and then they took the dead guys sister to jail because she wouldn't
&gt;stop saying fuck.
&gt;When they were taking her away I told her she should kill the cops and
&gt;then go home and wait for them to call.
&gt;How about if we made a law that you had to kill the president and your
&gt;congressmen and senators and if you didn't you had to pay a $500.00 fine
&gt;every year? Do you think they would make sure we all made some money?
&gt;How about a law here you could kill any politician that forgot to call
&gt;you sir or ma'am? Or who forgot your birthday?
&gt;We could save a lot of money just by putting all the politicians who are
&gt;running for office on a stage and then killing them at random until we
&gt;had the right number left. Then they would have to think about if they
&gt;really wanted it.
&gt;How about if we let people be elected on a first-come first-serve basis
&gt;but then we could vote to kill them any time we wanted. Think they 
&gt;would do things to make us not want to kill them instead of the other
&gt;way around like it is now?
&gt;How about if we killed all of them and just pretended there was someone
&gt;running the country. Is that a good idea?
&gt;
