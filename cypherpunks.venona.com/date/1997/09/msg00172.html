&gt;exist -- look in Car &amp; Driver or some such.

By the way, the last time I was driving around the Greater Washington
National Compound, there were signs in Virginia declaring that use of radar
detectors was illegal.

This sort of banning of certain technologies which "hinder law enforcement"
is of course what we were talking about a few weeks ago, with the "for law
enforcment use only" trends in the PRA.

The State Parks and Recreation cops I was shooting next to today were
wearing body armor...it looked like Second Chance Class III stuff. These
vests are no longer sold to civilians. (I don't know if this a "voluntary"
action by the body armor makers, or is codified in some obscure law. I know
that there are periodic calls to outlaw ownership of such things by
civilians, including certain types of bullets, certain types of detectors,
etc. These rangers were sharing the range, so to speak, and gave me some
long looks when I entered carrying an assault rifle case and went over to
my lane. By the way, in case anyone is wondering what State Parks and
Recreation rangers were doing at a target range, they were carrying .40 S&amp;W
semiautos...looked like mostly SIGs. Here in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the
rangers are essentially narcs and often run into marijuana fields hidden up
in the forests.

I didn't  mention to them my felon status.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
