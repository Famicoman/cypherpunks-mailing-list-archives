&gt;&gt;Mail is another hole.  Eudora now distributes PGP 5.0 with the latest
&gt;&gt;version.  (This version does not do RSA keys. You can get the plug in to do
&gt;&gt;those keys from PGP inc.)  This is helpful, but there are many other
&gt;&gt;plug-ins that need to be written.  Support for remailers is lacking.
&gt;&gt;Windows based code for Mixmaster is also a needed thing.  A good interface
&gt;&gt;would help immensely.  (Private Idaho was a big step in the right
&gt;&gt;direction. Integrated with a remailer people already use would be another
&gt;&gt;big step forward.)

&gt;Agreed.  I think Remailer support could be a big opportunity.  People may
&gt;not understand/care-about encryption, digital signing, etc., but they
&gt;definitely understand the need for anonymity.

Give the people what they want.

&gt;Question:  If a free remailer plugin for eudora is released, can the
&gt;remailers handle the increased load?  Are there enough remailers?
&gt;People will not tolerate more than a 24 hour delay for getting their
&gt;messages delivers.  What about spamming?  

Use hashcash, or even better, digital cash of your chosen currency.

It costs 32 cents to mail a first class letter.  Is it worth paying that to 
send an anonymous email through a chain of a dozen remailers using a Eudora 
plug-in, or a java applet?  For some people it is, if it's made easy to do.

If a thousand people used it each day, that would mean $320 every 24 hours, 
or $116,800 a year to be divided up amongst the 12 remailer operators.  
Similar possibilities exist for remailer pinging services and nymservers.

&gt;&gt;I am sure that people can think of all sorts of other ideas for needed
&gt;&gt;apps.  But to make them usable for the "general public", the apps will be
&gt;&gt;needed to be written for Windows.  (As much as I hate to think about it...)

Why not rewrite Windows?  Call it Secured Windows (or S/Win).  Features 
might include:
	- no swapfile, or at least one that is securely deleted each
	  time the system is shut down
	- automatically overwrite __ times when deleting information
	  from the hard drive
	- digital cash wallet app
	- S/WAN or SSH-type access to ISP
	- library of different encryption apps, including an easy way
	  to quickly encrypt all sensitive files

Initially S/Win would be useful for emerging ecommerce businesses, and also 
companies and individuals handling sensitive data (i.e., accountants, 
lawyers, etc.).  As ecommerce begins to evolve, people doing high-value 
transactions (like buying stocks and other financial instruments) will want 
to know they aren't getting bogus stock ticker prices (a la IP-spoofing) so
they don't unintentionally "sell the farm" at the wrong moment.

Maybe it's a crazy idea to rewrite Windows, but seeing as so many people are 
familiar with it already, why not make it more useful/better/secure?  

When the majority of computer owners realize that their emoney transactions 
can be compromised on an unsecure platform like Windows, they will demand a 
"product" like S/Win.  After all, what good is your personal Verisign 
certificate (a public key) -- not to mention SET -- if the corresponding 
signing/authentication (secret) key can be swiped off your computer by a 
malicious Active X control along with the keystroke sequence of your 
passphrase?
