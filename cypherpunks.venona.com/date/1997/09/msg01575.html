What I did:  write a Windows 95 screen saver that automatically brute
forces 40-bit RC2 keys.  The screen saver is has an easy interface, and
parallizes nicely.

What I didn't do:  break S/MIME.  I did not find any flaw in the S/MIME
security specification.  I did not find any flaw in any of the cryptographic
algorithms used.  I did not find any flaw in any software implementation
of S/MIME.  There is nothing wrong with the S/MIME standard.

What I find, though, is that many S/MIME implementations don't interporate
at anything stronger than 40-bit RC2.  I find that the default encryption
is 40-bit RC2, and the user isn't given any indication that the encryption
level should be changed.

40-bit RC2 is weak.  This is nothing new to anyone who reads the S/MIME
specifications. In fact, the S/MIME specification is very forthcoming in
discussing security of 40-bit RC2.

&gt; 2.6 ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier
&gt;
&gt; Receiving agents MUST support decryption and encryption using the RC2
&gt; algorithm [RC2] at a key size of 40 bits, hereinafter called "RC2/40".
&gt; Receiving agents SHOULD support decryption using DES EDE3 CBC,
&gt; hereinafter called "tripleDES".
&gt;
&gt; Sending agents SHOULD support encryption with RC2/40 and tripleDES.

Later in the spec, the following appears:

&gt; Before sending a message, the sending agent MUST decide whether it is
&gt; willing to use weak encryption for the particular data in the message.
&gt; If the sending agent decides that weak encryption is unacceptable for
&gt; this data, then the sending agent MUST NOT use a weak algorithm such
&gt; as RC2/40. The decision to use or not use weak encryption overrides
&gt; any other decision in this section about which encryption algorithm to
&gt; use.

And even later:

&gt; 2.6.2.3 Rule 3: Unknown Capabilities, Risk of Failed Decryption
&gt;
&gt; If:
&gt;  - the sending agent has no knowledge of the encryption capabilities
&gt;    of the recipient,
&gt;  - and the sending agent is willing to risk that the recipient may
&gt;    not be able to decrypt the message,
&gt; then the sending agent SHOULD use tripleDES.
&gt;
&gt; 2.6.2.4 Rule 4: Unknown Capabilities, No Risk of Failed Decryption
&gt;
&gt; If:
&gt;  - the sending agent has no knowledge of the encryption capabilities
&gt;    of the recipient,
&gt;  - and the sending agent is not willing to risk that the recipient
&gt;    may not be able to decrypt the message,
&gt; then the sending agent MUST use RC2/40.

And:

&gt; 2.6.3 Choosing Weak Encryption
&gt;
&gt; Like all algorithms that use 40 bit keys, RC2/40 is considered by many
&gt; to be weak encryption. A sending agent that is controlled by a human
&gt; SHOULD allow a human sender to determine the risks of sending data
&gt; using RC2/40 or a similarly weak encryption algorithm before sending
&gt; the data, and possibly allow the human to use a stronger encryption
&gt; method such as tripleDES.

I wrote this screen saver not to trash S/MIME (even though the announcement
was used by another company), but to 1) illustrate that 40-bit RC2 really
is insecure, and 2) try to force companies who implement S/MIME to get
DES and triple-DES to interoperate.  I heard recently that RSADSI has said
there is a triple-DES message on their website that can be understood by
both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator.  I don't know
about the message, but when I tried to get DES and triple-DES to interoperate
a few months ago I couldn't.
