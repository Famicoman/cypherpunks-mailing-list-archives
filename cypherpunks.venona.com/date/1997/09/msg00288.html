               The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                            Presents
                          Peter Cassidy
                     Author, Technology Analyst

                        A Future Garrisoned:
                    How Long Can Military Fiat
               Control Digital Commerce Technologies?



                      Tuesday, October 7, 1997
                             12 - 2 PM
                 The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                   One Federal Street, Boston, MA




It is the wonderful American expectation of the new that informs a
belief that what is technically possible is inevitable. Peter Cassidy's
presentation - "A Future Garrisoned: How Long Can Military Fiat Control
Digitial Commerce Technologies?" - will measure the political distance
between what is possible in digital commerce and the reality of trying to
establish it in the face of a campaign of disruption orchestrated by as
influential an actor as the military-intelligence complex.
	Mr. Cassidy will discuss the decades-long twilight engagement that
has been fought between the military intelligence agencies and the
civilian sector since the late 1970s when it became apparent that
cryptography would not long remain the preserve of the military without
political intervention. (In his research, Mr. Cassidy has discovered that
military intelligence agencies in the United States have a larger scope of
interest in communications technologies than that which makes its way into
the mass media, including such vital parts of the modern infrastructure as
the civilian telephone network.)
	Mr. Cassidy will extrapolate what political and industrial
barriers this campaign of disruption presents for the wide-scale adoption
of strong cryptographic technologies, digital specie and other electronic
financial instrumentation - such as adaption of Federal Reserve policy to
the digital commerce space. As well, Mr. Cassidy will look at the routes
of evasive action that are taken by creative digital commerce pioneers to
end-run the most palpable of military barriers to electronic commerce: the
export control regulations.


For the public presses, Peter Cassidy covers technology, white collar
crime and national affairs and, for research firms, he authors analyses on
technologies and their relevant markets. His reportage and opinion pieces
have appeared in WIRED, Forbes ASAP, The Economist, The Covert Action
Quarterly, The Progressive, The Texas Observer, Telepath Magazine, Bankers
Monthly, American Banker, InformationWeek, CFO Magazine, OMNI, The Boston
Sunday Globe, Boston Magazine, The Sunday Sacramento Bee, ComputerWorld,
National Mortgage News, Mortgage Technology, The International Digital
Media Yearbook (Japan), NetscapeWorld, CIO Magazine, Webmaster Magazine,
Datamation Magazine, World Trade Magazine and dozens of magazines and
newspapers worldwide. Several of his pieces have been included in
anthologies and college social studies texts. His expertise in information
technologies has garnered him contracts with some of the most prestigious
industrial research firms in America - Giga Information Group, Dataquest,
CI-InfoCorp, Business Research Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Cahners/Reed
Elsevier, and NSI Information Services - for whom he has authored analyses
on a range of subjects including cryptography and the network security
industry.


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, October 7, 1997, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$30.00. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware, and
the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets
and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate business
attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since we purchase
these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the price of your
lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress code.

We will attempt to record this meeting and put it on the web in RealAudio
format at some future date

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really*
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, October 4, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston", in the amount of $30.00. Please include your e-mail
address, so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

November  Carl Ellison         Identity and Certification for Electronic
                                Commerce
December  James O'Toole        Internet Coupons
January   Joseph Reagle        "Social Protocols": Meta-data
                                and Negotiation in Digital Commerce


We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, &lt;mailto: rah@shipwright.com&gt; .
