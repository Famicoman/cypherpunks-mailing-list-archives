Read on.

Jane Nelson tells how she ran this program four times last year.  
This first time, she received $500,000 in cash, and over $700,000 
the last three times this year.

If this letter is continued, as it should be, 
EVERYONE PROFITS!

Just send one person 
FIVE DOLLARS - THAT'S ALL! 
After the first time, you'll see how easy it is and how 
beautifully it works!  Now here are the simple details...

Follow WHAT TO DO below and 
IN ONLY FOUR WEEKS YOU'LL RECEIVE 
UP TO $700,000 because most people will respond, 
due to the LOW INVESTMENT
and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL.

WHAT TO DO
On a blank sheet of paper, write "Please put me on your mailing list"
along with your name and address and put it with a Five-Dollar Bill.  
Through regular mail, send this to the last person on the list below.  
ONLY THE LAST PERSON ON THE LIST GETS YOUR NAME AND $5 
BILL!
Then remove that name from the list.  Move the other three names 
down and add your name to the list in the #1 position.

After you have re-typed the list with your name in the #1 position,
MAKE AT LEAST 20 COPIES OF THE LETTER AND SEND IT OUT
IMMEDIATELY TO 20 OR MORE PROSPECTS.
Friends, relatives - anyone you'd like to see get rich along with you!
The faster you act, the faster you'll get your money!

US Mail or Email!!!
For email, you can just copy this whole letter and paste it into 
the body part of AOL's "Compose Mail" box.  
Then be sure to remove the last name on the list below,
and add your name as the first.
YOU STILL HAVE TO USE REGULAR MAIL TO SEND YOUR $5
AND ADDRESS TO THE LAST NAME!
That's what keeps this legal and how everyone gets paid!

That's all there is to it!  Here's how it works:

1.  You send out 20 letters to 20 Prospects
2.  Those 20 mail out 20 letters each (400)
3.  Those 400 mail out 20 letters each (8,000)
4.  Those 8,000 mail out 20 letter each (160,000)
5.  And those 160,000 people mail YOU 5$ each ($800,000)
Your entire investment is only $5!!!  Very inexpensive when you consider
the results you can get!
HONESTY AND INTEGRETY MAKE THIS PLAN WORK.
Breaking the rules on the way it is sent only messes up your chance of it 
working right! 
DON'T BREAK THE RULES!

Be sure to follow the instruction and omit nothing.  At this time
we are receiving an almost 100% return rate for people wise enough to
participate in the plan.

The majority receive about $700,000 on average!  And rest assured
this plan is 100% Legal!  You are providing a service to people to put
them on your mailing list.

(Please refer To):
(Title 18, Section 1302 of the US Postal Code and Lottery Laws.)

PLEASE MAIL YOUR LETTERS ASAP!

I WISH YOU SUCCESS AND TOGETHER WE'LL ALL PROSPER.

DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS!
