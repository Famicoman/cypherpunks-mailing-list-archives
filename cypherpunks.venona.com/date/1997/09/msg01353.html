<U><B>What They Don't Want You to Know<BR>
</B></U>   by  Auto-Correspondent &quot;http://www.cjnetworks.com/~cubsfan/conspiracy.html&quot;
<P>
In order to understand InfoWar you need to realize that everything
is<BR>
controlled by a CypherPunks list made up of Cult of One members
<BR>
with help from Nobody and Anonymous.
<P>
The conspiracy first started during the Censorship Experiment
in<BR>
majordomo@toad.com. They have been responsible for many<BR>
events throughout history, including the InfoWar.
<P>
Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be<BR>
identified by their Code writing.
<P>
They want to electronically forge TruthMonger posts and imprison
<BR>
resisters in Silicon Valley using Trei Transponders.
<P>
In order to prepare for this, we all must Nuke DC. Since the media
<BR>
is controlled by Declan McCullagh we should get our information
<BR>
from Black Unicorn's yellow-menace writing in blanc snow..
<HR>
<P>
Just as he had suspected!
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later read the output of the Java script
at Left Turn's 'Make Your Own Conspiracy Theory' page.<BR>
Left Turn had confirmed everything he had been discovering on
his own, even when he had discovered facts and information which
pointed toward completely contradictory conspiracy theories. A
Player To Be Named Later recognized that this was positive proof
that the roots of the Great Conspiracy had spread throughout the
very fabric of reality, itself.
<P>
He now knew that the conspiracy was no longer just some outside
entity which lived in the shadows around him, waiting for him
to let down his guard before it sprang its waiting traps and enclosed
him with its vicious iron jaws.<BR>
He now knew that it went much, much deeper than that.
<P>
<B>Now, he knew the conspiracy was in his Mind!<BR>
</B>
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later had immediately dropped all of his
other InterNet personas and erased all signs of them from his
hard drive. With the new knowledge he had gained, he knew that
he could no longer trust even himself.
<P>
The first sign that the conspiracy had managed to spread throughout
both reality and virtual reality were the posts to the CypherPunks
mailing list by Damaged Justice.
<P>
<B>Subject:</B> Internet putting truth in danger<BR>
<B>From:</B> Damaged Justice &lt;frogfarm@yakko.cs.wmich.edu&gt;
<BR>
<B>Organization:</B> Somewhere just far enough outside of your
jurisdiction<BR>
<B>To:</B> cypherpunks@Algebra.COM
<P>
   THE generation that has grown up on The X-Files poses a threat
to the<BR>
   future of journalism, Fergal Keane, the BBC's Asia Correspondent,
said<BR>
   last night.
<P>
<B>Subject:</B> Assassination Politics of a sort
<P>
   There's a bounty on Gordie Howe's head. And Gordie isn't laughing
about it.<BR>
   Howe, 69, is planning to file a police complaint against a
California radio <BR>
   personality who offered a bounty to have &quot;the old fool
pummeled back to reality.&quot;
<P>
<B>Subject:</B> FBI vs Silicon Valley: Guess Who's Winning?<BR>
    The likely outcome: a tactical retreat by industry to avoid
an all-out rout. <BR>
    The electronic wizards seem to have met their match in a Washington
cop<BR>
     named Louis Freeh.
<P>
<B>Subject:</B> Trac[k]ing the Successful Drug User
<P>
   By deploying their questionnaire on the Web, the researchers
are<BR>
   hoping to use the relative anonymity of the Net to access a
&quot;hidden<BR>
   population&quot; of drug users who would be disinclined to
give accurate<BR>
   reports of illegal use to face-to-face interviewers, Nicholson
says.<BR>
<P>
In a short series of posts, Damaged Justice had managed to subtly
point out that:<BR>
  The InterNet, in the hands of the public, was a threat to truth.
<BR>
  Assassination Politics would lead to the death of heroes such
as Gordie Howe.<BR>
  Louis Freeh is going to kick the electronic wizards' butts.
<BR>
  Successful people on the InterNet are all secret drug users.
<BR>
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later had seen the duplicity in Damaged Justice's
posts long before this, just as he had in the posts of Se7en.
<BR>
Se7en purported to be a diabolical hacker turned lecturer, working
the security and LEA (law enforcement agency) circuit, but it
had become obvious that it was they who were working him. Se7en
had got caught up in the LEA's child pornography ruse and wrote
a lengthy diatribe to the CypherPunks list about the millions
of pedophiles lurking in the shadows of the InterNet. This came
at a time which was convenient for adding support to the agendas
of several of the government shills working the list at that time.
<BR>
A Player To Be Named Later had followed the trail of alleged pointers
and addresses that were provided by Se7en, only to find the usual
spooks lurking in the background. It was obvious that the spooks
were doing their best to cultivate a crop of genuine pedophiles
by seeding the InterNet with pointers to trails of perversion
that they had carefully laid out themselves. No doubt they would
keep their self-generated perverts on ice until it came time to
drag them out into the public eye for one of their show-and-tell
displays of the 'good fight' they were putting up against the
evil InterNet.
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later hadn't run his usual analysis on the
past posts and email traffic of Damaged Justice and those connected
to him, but he was not sure that it really mattered anymore, anyway.
<BR>
There were indications that FUD/DoubleSpeak/SpinDoctoring/VirtualTruth-whatever
you wanted to name it-had reached critical mass.
<P>
He took another look at one of Choate's posts to the CypherPunks
list:<BR>
<B>Subject:</B> 6 USAF Crashes in 7 days = InfoWar?<BR>
<B>From:</B>  Jim Choate &lt;ravage@ssz.com&gt;<BR>
<B>To:</B> cypherpunks@ssz.com (Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer)
<P>
Just a thought...<BR>
<P>
The connection was obvious.<BR>
A number of stories made it into the periphery of the mainstream
press concerning the U.S. spooks campaign to murder 'bad' foreigners
by introducing defective parts into the products they bought for
their armed forces. Then the U.S. forces immediately got hit with
a rash of high-profile 'accidents' to their own military units.
<BR>
It was a clear message to the U.S. spooks that two (or more) could
play that game. So clear, in fact, that the Pentagon publicly
and privately pulled in the reins on a variety of normal and special
operations, in order to shake the trees for defective parts and
defective soldiers. (Mostly the latter.)
<P>
The Real Guy had planned an expose on the background events taking
place in this area, but had decided not to do so, uncertain as
to why he had made that decision, at the time.<BR>
Now, A Player To Be Named Later realized that it was because FUD
(Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Disinformation) had become the rule of
the day, and there was no longer anyone left to preach to but
the converted-and the converted were becoming unconverted at an
increasingly rapid rate.
<P>
It had become obvious, I suppose, when it took so little effort
on the Pentagon's part to cover up the pair of rogue U.S. Air
Force pilots who had been positively linked to the Circle of Eunuchs
by the secret task force dedicated to rooting them out of their
hiding places deep within the bowels of government and corporate
agencies around the world.
<P>
It was not surprising that they had managed to cover up the involvement
of the nuclear bomber pilot, since they were able to label her
a sex criminal before she had taken any overt action that would
serve to trigger the interest of those paying close attention
to such things. <BR>
It was her proximity to the Author's current location that had
led to her discovery. The retired Air Force intelligence officer
who had been assigned to shadow the Author in Do Well, Saskatchewan,
had alerted Canadian Customs to notify him any time that soldiers
from Minot Air Force Base crossed into his territory. Although
she never made physical contact with the Author, her mere presence
in close proximity to him led to an in-depth investigation that
turned up enough 'coincidences' to require her removal from service.
<P>
What was very troubling, however, was the fact that another of
the Author's contacts, from the Air Force base at his old stomping
grounds in Tucson, had been able to break formation on a training
run, fly halfway across the country with live bombs, almost making
it to the site of the McVeigh trial in Denver, and yet it hardly
rated a &quot;Gee, I wonder why he did that?&quot; in the mainstream
press.<BR>
Tentative suggestions that the pilot was 'emotionally troubled'
were eaten up by the press, despite evidence to the contrary from
his friends and relatives, so readily that the Air Force never
even had to release the 'psychiatrist reports' that had been hastily
prepared to be 'leaked' to the right sources, if needed.
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later wondered if all reporters for the mainstream
press were not, in fact, still incarcerated in the press compounds
set up for Operation Desert Storm. Were the 'backgrounds' they
appeared to be reporting from in reality just virtual creations
from inside their media prison?
<P>
A pilot carrying live bombs makes a beeline for the site of the
Oklahoma Bomber's trial; a truck full nuclear warheads goes missing;
soldiers on a base are the target of an armed assault; the pilot
of a nuclear bomber is shanghaied on curiously slim pretexts;
a horde of major armed forces figures suddenly resign or are shifted
to non-sensitive positions-and the world hardly seems to notice.
<BR>
When a single former Russian General, however, with close connections
to the spooks, writes a no-brainer book with unsupported claims
about nuclear suitcases falling into the hands of the US's proclaimed
'enemies,' then the mainstream press snaps to attention and gives
full coverage to the dark threat posed by theoretical, unseen,
dark-skinned people who we will need to be protected from, in
the future.
<P>
<I>&quot;Gee, I wonder why he would do that?&quot;</I> A Player
To Be Named Later said, sarcastically, while visualizing a dark-skinned
person in a foreign country purchasing a nuclear suitcase from
CIA-run Russian spooks.<BR>
<I>&quot;I suppose that if there was hard, non-refutable evidence
of an Air Force soldier purchasing a nuclear suitcase and going
AWOL, headed for Washington, DC, that this would be the reaction
of the mainstream press. But let a foreign 'darkie' try it, and
all of a sudden we need to suspend some more basic human rights,
even if it was a BATF shill who was being run by a CIA connected,
former German intelligence operative who is related to a high-ranking
German politician who was involved in the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms
scandal.&quot;</I>
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later reached for a bottle of Scotch sitting
behind his laptop, taking a slow pull off of it as he reviewed
the signs of the death of investigative journalism in the past
few years.<BR>
The CIA had used Woodward and Bernstein effectively during their
assault on the Presidency at the close of the Nixon scandal. The
problem was that it inspired a plethora of uncontrollable impersonators
who wreaked havoc with their efforts at FUD control. So  they
orchestrated the movement of investigative journalism into the
mundane mainstream of everyday life.<BR>
The sheeple didn't care about world politics and behind the scenes
power struggles. Their real interests lie in secret videos of
an employee dipping his dick in a coworker's coffee; a mechanic
putting the old distributor cap back on and charging the customer
for a new one; a black mayor snorting coke and getting a little
trim from the ladies of the night.<BR>
All of this became breaking news which required the full force
of the media digging into the dark corners of these people's lives.
Until the world's nasty little secrets became just another everyday,
run of the mill part of normal life.
<P>
Now, Media Reality had finally approached critical mass, as foreseen
by a variety of voices crying in the wilderness, from George Orwell
to Marshal McLuhan.<BR>
Now, it was only a matter of time.<BR>
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later read the &quot;Internet putting truth
in danger&quot; post by Damaged Justice, once again:<BR>
<I>   Mr Keane, delivering the Huw Weldon Memorial Lecture at
a television<BR>
   convention, said that he was worried about the growing influence
of<BR>
   the Internet, and the conspiracy theories that are aired on
it.</I>
<P>
God help us if things deteriorated to the point where ordinary
people put the mainstream media 'truth' in danger by pointing
out the obvious to people who <B>didn't</B> really <B>want</B>
to know why a U.S. Air Force pilot would head for the site of
McVeigh's trial with a load of live bombs.<BR>
Maybe he just got lost&#133;
<P>
<I>   He told the Royal Television Society's Cambridge Convention
that the<BR>
   rash of rumours about the circumstances of the death of Diana,
<BR>
   Princess of Wales showed that there was a public appetite for
<BR>
   speculation and fantasy. He said: &quot;Will the generation
growing up on<BR>
   The X-Files really want to choose calm, considered reportage
when they<BR>
   have science-fiction and fantasy?&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Calm, considered reportage.&quot;</I> A Player To Be
Named Later intoned, solemnly, thinking about the first interview
he had seen by the major media with someone who had been close
to the Princess's fatal accident.<BR>
<I>&quot;Explosion.&quot; </I>That was the first, and only, time
he had heard that word used by someone who had been present at
the time of the accident. By the time the rest of North America
had awoken that morning, there were only reporters feeding the
world the disinformation being officially released by the authorities.
And in a world where reporters will dig up a dead body to do DNA
tests to see if the deceased was, indeed, fucking Tom Cruise,
the major networks somehow managed to 'lose' the footage of interviews
with the original witnesses, offering, instead, interviews with
people who thought that maybe something was perhaps taking place
down there in the tunnel, but who really knows? <BR>
We were told that there were no witnesses to the accident, yet
we were still fed unlikely reports of a motorcycle with photographers
on it zigzagging in front of the death vehicle at over a hundred
miles an hour, and sundry other inanities reeking of  'now you
see it, now you don't' spin doctoring. <I>   </I>
<P>
<I>   He said that the trend threatened to plunge reporting into
the<BR>
   &quot;rumour-ridden gloom of the Middle Ages&quot;.</I>
<P>
God forbid that unseemly rumors might spread concerning a man
heading a covert organization involved in running illegal drugs
and arms ascending to the Presidency after succeeding the front-man
who had come to power as a result of those illegal actions, and
who had invaded a foreign country to capture the drug-dealing
monster who had been his closest bum-buddy during his spook days.
<BR>
God forbid that Joe Average should be exposed to the knowledge
that a succession of their Presidents were backed by the big bucks
made by their friends and relatives in business with the Nazis
right up to the end of World War II.
<P>
Knowledge such as this was <B>dangerous</B> knowledge that would
put the spoon-fed &quot;truth&quot; of the mainstream media &quot;in
danger&quot; if the InterNet was allowed to become a purveyor
of 'unofficial' or 'non-approved' news.<BR>
<P>
A Player To Be Named Later thought of the three days of intensive
press coverage in which a multitude of mainstream media personnel
spent hour upon hour adding fuel to 'official leak' inspired rumors
while not seeming to be able to get any information at all on
the players who were part and parcel of the media's daily business
activities.<BR>
He had been waiting to see the pictures of the concrete column
that the heavily armored death vehicle had supposedly hit at over
a hundred miles per hour. Nothing.
<P>
<I>{In Toledo, or Detroit, or some other 'cable channel' city,
a day or so later, some no-name John Doe was killed after his
vehicle struck a concrete column on a local road structure. There
were reporters from a number of media sources there, getting close-ups
of the vehicle, the column, and the damage to it, the broken scraps
of concrete at the accident scene. A Player To Be Named Later
saw it two or three times that day, as the media ensured that
all the circumstances surrounding the death of John Doe would
be subjected to the light of mainstream media 'truth.' He saw
pictures from a variety of different angles, obviously taken in
the interest of satisfying his 'right to know' all of the details
surrounding the death of John Doe, Anywhere, USA.}</I>
