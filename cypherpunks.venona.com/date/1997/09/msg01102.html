This would probably be a pretty interesting complaint to read, if there are
any DC-area cypherpunks who feel like making a trip down to the courthouse ..

&gt;Subject: LACC:  DEA Agents Accuse CIA of Tapping Phones
&gt;
&gt;Real-To:  proff@suburbia.net
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The CIA and other spy
&gt;agencies have systematically tapped the phones of
&gt;overseas  Drug Enforcement Administration offices,
&gt;according to a class action lawsuit agents filed
&gt;Thursday in Washington.
&gt;
&gt;The lawsuit, which also names the National Security
&gt;Agency and the State Department, seeks a court
&gt;order barring those agencies from any further
&gt;wiretapping.
&gt;
&gt;"These agencies have a pattern and practice of
&gt;eavesdropping on DEA agents' and employees'
&gt;conversations while they are serving the government
&gt;overseas," said attorney Brian Leighton of Clovis, Calif.
&gt;
&gt;But legal experts say it could be a difficult lawsuit to
&gt;win, especially since an employer - in this case the
&gt;government - generally has a right to listen to employee
&gt;conversation on office phones.
&gt;
&gt;It also doesn't help that national security was involved
&gt;and that courts have held that U.S. citizens don't have
&gt;constitutional rights overseas.
&gt;
&gt;``It's an uphill battle. It's going to be a tough suit,'' said
&gt;constitutional law expert Paul Rothstein of Georgetown
&gt;University.
&gt;
&gt;The lawsuit was filed on behalf of all DEA agents,
&gt;but the agency itself was not part of the action.
&gt;
&gt;The only DEA agent named as a plaintiff in the suit
&gt;is Richard A. Horn, currently with the agency's New
&gt;Orleans bureau. Five other incidents involving other
&gt;unidentified agents are alleged.
&gt;
&gt;Two years ago Horn filed a lawsuit accusing U.S.
&gt;officials of undermining his anti-drug efforts in Burma.
&gt;
&gt;That suit is still pending.
&gt;
&gt;Leighton said subsequent contacts with other DEA
&gt;personnel revealed a pattern of similar abuses around
&gt;the world.
&gt;
&gt;CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said he could not
&gt;comment directly on the class action lawsuit, but
&gt;defended his agency.
&gt;
&gt;"It is not the CIA's mission, nor is it part of the
&gt;operations of the agency, to surveil in any manner
&gt;U.S. officials, or other U.S. citizens at home or
&gt;abroad,'' Mansfield said.
&gt;
&gt;The only exception would be in counterintelligence
&gt;cases, he added, and then only in consultation with
&gt;senior Justice Department officials.
&gt;
&gt;DEA spokesman James McGivney said he could not
&gt;comment on pending litigation, but noted that as a
&gt;U.S. citizen, Horn had the right file his own lawsuit.
&gt;
&gt;John Russell, spokesman for the Justice Department,
&gt;which defends the other agencies in lawsuits,
&gt;said only, ``we will respond in court.''
&gt;
&gt;In Horn's previous case, Leighton said, the Justice
&gt;Department angered DEA agents by claiming they
&gt;have no Fourth Amendment constitutional right
&gt;against wiretapping when working outside the
&gt;country.
&gt;
&gt;Leighton, a former federal prosecutor, said the
&gt;lawsuit doesn't address the reasons for the alleged
&gt;electronic eavesdropping.
&gt;
&gt;"My assumption is because they want to know
&gt;what DEA is doing, they want to rip off DEA
&gt;informants, they want to know DEA contacts
&gt;within foreign governments,'' Leighton said.
&gt;``And with the Cold War over, these agencies
&gt;are looking for a new mission.''
&gt;
&gt;An April 1996 letter to agents by Horn and
&gt;Leighton, details the allegation of wiretapping
&gt;against the agent in Burma.
&gt;
&gt;Horn's residence ``was the target of a U.S.
&gt;Government Agency-sponsored electronic audio
&gt;intercept,'' it said.
&gt;
&gt;"Horn had occasion to see a cable containing
&gt;his words in quotation marks, that he had spoken
&gt;to another DEA agent, set forth exactly as stated...''
&gt;
&gt;The suit also reports alleged wiretaps against
&gt;DEA agents in the Dominican Republic from
&gt;1987 to 1990, in May 1993 and September 1994
&gt;at the Bangkok, Thailand office; at the Guatemala
&gt;City office in 1984, 1985 and from 1987 to 1989;
&gt;and in an unidentified location in April 1987.
&gt;
&gt;The suit, assigned to U.S. District Judge Harold H.
&gt;Greene, names as defendants Secretary of State
&gt;Warren Christopher, CIA Director John Deutch
&gt;and NSA Director Adm. J.M. McConnell.
