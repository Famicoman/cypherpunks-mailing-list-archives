A Player To Be Named Later glanced quickly over his shoulder,
to make certain that no one was paying any particular amount of
attention to him.<BR>
In one swift motion, he stepped sideways into the telephone booth,
and began removing his clothes. Seconds later, he emerged from
the telephone booth&#133;as The Real Guy.

<P>
<I>&quot;Turn to your left, please.&quot; </I>the police photographer
sounded bored. As soon as he had finished with the flasher, he
was off-shift and headed straight for The Stone Fox nude club
to watch his favorite ladies engage in legalized flashing.
<P>
The prisoner smiled as he saw the lady cop waiting to take him
downstairs for fingerprinting checking out his firmware.<BR>
<I>&quot;I <B>told</B> you I was The Real Guy.&quot; </I>he said,

FBI Calls Privacy Extremists Elitist<BR>
(09/25/97; 4:30 p.m. EDT) By David Braun, TechWire 
<P>
MONTREAL -- Extremist positions on electronic encryption are not
only<BR>
threatening to normal law enforcement, but they are also elitist
and<BR>
non-democratic, said Alan McDonald, a senior counsel member with
the<BR>
Federal Bureau of Investigation, at the International Conference
on<BR>
Privacy in Montreal on Thursday.<BR>
<B>&#133;<BR>
</B>Absolute positions on privacy were &quot;pernicious on several
levels,&quot;<BR>
McDonald added, <I>in an attempt to daemonize citizens who value
their<BR>
privacy and resent attempts by government to build a surveillance
state.<BR>
</I><B>&#133;<BR>
</B>Extreme privacy positions were ultimately elitist and nondemocratic
in that they<BR>
presumed the views of a knowing privacy cognoscenti should pre-empt
the<BR>
views of the nation's elected officials and the Supreme Court,
McDonald<BR>
said. <I>He added that the elitist and non-democratic founding
fathers had<BR>
established this cursed tradition by their misuse of the term
&quot;we the people&quot;<BR>
and that it had taken many years to set things straight.<BR>
</I><B>&#133;<BR>
</B>Extremists presumed that the citizens could not trust the
elected<BR>
government and the Supreme Court to make decisions or to correct
<BR>
mistakes if any are made, McDonald said. <I>He told those present
that<BR>
if the Waco investigation had shown the massacre of the Branch
<BR>
Davidians to be a mistake, then the Supreme Court would have ruled
<BR>
that the government must bring those killed back to life. <BR>
</I><B>&#133;<BR>
</B>McDonald said efforts in the United States to enhance effective
law<BR>
enforcement search and seizure capabilities had proceeded without
<BR>
harming legitimate privacy concerns. <I>He stated that anyone
who<BR>
found this hard to believe could ask FBI Director, Lying Fuck
Louis<BR>
Free to confirm his statement.<BR>
</I><B>&#133;</B>
<P>
Notwithstanding the substantial threats posed by national and
<BR>
international organized crime, drug cartels, and terrorists, the
United<BR>
States had remained true to its Constitutional moorings, and its
<BR>
commitment to a system of ordered liberties, McDonald said.<BR>
<I>Handouts were given to those in attendance, showing that most
of<BR>
the drug czars and terrorists were concentrated in short stretches
<BR>
of Interstate highways where local law enforcement agencies were
<BR>
seizing their vehicles and money at an astounding rate, given
the<BR>
fact that almost all of them had gone to great lengths to disguise
<BR>
themselves as ordinary, everyday citizens.<BR>
</I><B>&#133;<BR>
</B>&quot;When people don't know much about electronic surveillance,
they are<BR>
fearful of it. But when they know Congress passed laws and the
Supreme<BR>
Court reviewed them and that there are numerous constraints and
<BR>
procedures, then it makes sense to them. It seems rational and
<BR>
balanced,&quot; McDonald said.<BR>
<I>He add that the way that the elitist, non-democratic privacy
extremists <BR>
rant and rave, you would believe that law enforcement agents went
<BR>
around sticking toilet plungers up their assholes, or something.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
The Real Guy reviewed his changes to David Braun's TechWire article.
He decided that his 'enhanced' version more clearly expressed
McDonald's views in a way that the common man could understand-or,
the common 'person' if they were one of those Left Coast troublemakers.
<P>
It was going to be a long and difficult task, but The Real Guy
knew that it was up to himself to bear the burden of informing
the Real World &#153; that there was, in fact, no grand conspiracy,
secret or otherwise, aimed at bringing the world totally under
the domination of the Evil One.<BR>
The biggest problem of bursting the bubble of the paranoid lunatics
running around stirring up the rabble with their far-fetched allegations,
was that the potential for their claims being true could be easily
substantiated by the real facts, as they existed.<BR>
Thus, these troublemakers could play on the irrational fears of
the sheeple in an attempt to undermine the years of effort that
had gone into convincing them to trust authority and to view their
government as benevolent public servants working in the best interests
of the citizens who elected them.
<P>
The Real Guy decided to make a list of the issues he would have
to address in order to build a solid foundation for his non-conspiracy
theory.<BR>
<P>
He began with a series of small, local items from the alternative
presses around the nation, knowing that much of the power of the
world-wide conspiracy theories being proclaimed were built upon
comparisons that the common man could understand.
<P>
For instance, there was an article on people who spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars campaigning for a $20,000 per year position
on the Austin Water Board. The article went on to document how
those who were elected to the Water Board were then in a position
to make decisions affecting multi-million dollar land development
projects, and how they all became filthy rich during their tenure
on the Water Board.<BR>
The Real Guy recognized this as just one of the many mean-spirited
attempts to slander successful people who had spent mountains
of money to gain a position where they could be of service to
their community, in order to repay the community for the millions
of dollars that they would be making in the future through graft
and bribery.
<P>
Then there was a state project involving the four-lane highway
outside a small town in Kansas which went&#133;well, pretty much
nowhere, actually.<BR>
Tens of millions had been spent on its construction before someone
pointed out that there was really no need for the road, and that
it was a tremendous waste of taxpayer money, since there was really
nowhere to go in that particular direction, and nobody who wanted
to go there. And, just because the politicians and businessmen
involved all made vast sums of money in its construction before
the project was halted, the skeptics assumed that there was something
more involved than an honest mistake by well-meaning people.
<P>
On a federal level, events could also be misconstrued by those
who aimed their misanthropic cynicism toward using the details
surrounding the history of the government as building blocks to
suggest nefarious secret agendas going on in the political background.
<BR>
These conspiratorial FUD artists would get great mileage out of
such simple coincidences as the only Catholic US President being
assassinated in the heart of the Baptist bible belt; the Vice
President under a President facing impeachment being removed to
put in place a politician who would pardon the criminal after
assuming his office; the head of the CIA accomplishing what the
head of the FBI was never able to do-assume control of the nation.
<BR>
<P>
The Real Guy had his work cut out for him in a variety of areas
which were intertwined with one another, and which all provided
fertile ground for the cynics to plant seeds of doubt as to the
honesty and integrity of those who had seized control of the reins
of power.
<P>
One of these areas was the media.<BR>
Certainly, once mesmerism, or hypnosis, had become a recognized
method of manipulating human consciousness, it provided fodder
for those who thought that people seeking power and wealth would
stoop so low as to use this for private gain, at the expense of
the masses. When it became commonly known that 'bad' people had
developed this new mind-altering technology in the arena of 'brainwashing,'
then it was only a matter of time before the naysayers would try
to associate honest, free-enterprise advertising with this evil,
mind-manipulation technique designed to change the orientation
of people's thoughts and perceptions.<BR>
When many of the most successful advertising experts moved into
the political arena, it gave the paranoid even more food for feeding
their proclivity for mistrustful mental machinations.
<P>
When commercial advertising proved the tremendous financial rewards
that could be obtained by directing the public's attention in
the direction of a desired perception and opinion of a commercial
product, there were, naturally, a few bad apples who took advantage
of this mind-influencing technology to lead the public to believe
things which were not, in fact, true, with the goal of enriching
themselves at the expense of others.<BR>
Fortunately, most of the evil thieves who became rich by using
the power of advertising to defraud the public used their money
to better themselves, often running for public office in order
to make amends for their past misconduct.
<P>
Again, the cynics would try to twist the facts to intimate that
the many thugs, thieves and other assorted criminals who rose
to prominent positions in corporate and political areas was an
indication of the perversion of democracy by powerful financial
figures who had learned to manipulate public perception via media
spin-doctoring.<BR>
This view, fortunately, was put to rest when a criminal felon
who had amassed a fortune in the bootlegging business during Prohibition
used his ill-gotten gain to provide the American people with a
President who epitomized the American dream.
<P>
The handsome, photogenic youth with the all-American family proved
the triumph of reality over spin-doctoring by being everything
that the citizens could hope for, and more, even to the point
where his royal court was given the name Camelot by the media.
<BR>
As a war-hero, he atoned for his father's sin of doing business
with the Nazis during the war in which he fought against them.
As a man with a beautiful and dutiful wife standing beside him,
at his beck and call, he atoned for the fact that he was screwing
the living shit out of a variety of women ranging from movie stars
to secretaries. As a man who was often photographed playing with
his beautiful children, he atoned for the fact that he was sending
American troops to a foreign country to kill their children.<BR>
<P>
The Real Guy reread his last paragraph, thinking that perhaps
there was something a little askew with the logic in it, but since
he couldn't put his finger on what it was, he decided to review
it later, when his mind was fresher.
<P>
Regardless, he felt that another issue he would need to tackle
in order to take the wind out of the paranoid conspiracy theorists'
sails was the increasing lack of hard-core investigative journalism
in the mainstream press when it came to events involving government
malfeasance.
<P>
A few of the wacky weirdoes playing their conspiracy games attempted
to point to the lack of solid reporting in certain areas of major
news stories as evidence of an ongoing cover-up of nefarious activities
by people with shadowy agendas.<BR>
One example was the absence of any reporters doing serious research
into the reason that a large number of law enforcement related
personnel seemed to be absent from the scenes of crimes that took
place in their regular workplaces, including the BATF agents at
the site of the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building.
<P>
Rather than being part of some grand conspiracy, The Real Guy
saw this as a simple issue of market-place economics. Media giants
realized that their readers and viewers would much rather have
reporting resources centered on matters of more interest to them,
such as researching the facts behind the death of Natalie Woods.
They would want to know who was present at the media event, who
wasn't there, what they were wearing, what everybody had to eat
and drink, who was fucking who, and what color the drapes were
on the yacht.<BR>
If the public had more interest in the presence of celebrities
at the site of a celebrity death than they had in the absence
of law enforcement agents in charge of preventing bombings at
the bombing of their own workplace, then it was certainly not
the fault of the media. <BR>
If major drug dealers would bring their planes into Florida during
the Miami Dolphin football games because they knew the Customs
agents would pay more attention to game instead of intercepting
drug smugglers, that was not the fault of the media.<BR>
'Saving the children' was important, but not important enough
to miss 'the game.'<BR>
<BR>
The Real Guy knew that he would also have to address the entertainment
media's movement toward providing more and more programs canonizing
law enforcement agencies and officers, and paying tribute to the
benefits of living in a surveillance state.
<P>
People didn't want to see pictures of darkies getting toilet plungers
shoved up their ass. They wanted to see pictures of white officers
calling darkies 'Sir.' before they violated their Constitutional
rights and then imprisoned or shot them. The public wanted to
see footage of darkies being rousted in cars with bad mufflers
and imprisoned for possession of a joint-not pictures of people
of all races being shaken down and having their money and possessions
confiscated for possession of the same joint (after the darkie
had been booked and printed).
<P>
The paranoid conspiracy theorists railed against the media's portrayal
of LEA's as righteous crime fighters who killed and imprisoned
only 'bad' people who were going to do terrible things to mom,
her apple pie, and the flag. The Real Guy knew that the media
was only trying to present a balanced picture of virtual reality
for the public, since they got to see the LEA's murder men, women
and children on the news, so there was no need to replicate this
and their other atrocities in the field of entertainment.
<P>
The Real Guy recognized that the media's prime purpose was to
serve as the new, improved opiate of the masses. Since it was
impossible for people to live in <B>real</B> safety and security
in the Real World &#153;, the media was burdened with the responsibility
for assuring that they could do so in the Virtual World &#153;
of Digital Reality &#153;.<BR>
<P>
The Digital Revolution &#153; was designed as a gentler, kinder
revolution which would subtly replace Analog Reality with Digital
Reality &#153;, without the need for violence and bloodshed, except
in cases of Thought Criminals who stubbornly refused to accept
the authority of the Mind Police, acting in the legitimate interests
of Attitude Enforcement.<BR>
<P>
The Real Guy knew that if there indeed was a conspiracy between
the secret government and the media czars that one could expect
to find hard evidence, such as a TV show that represented the
FBI as an organization whose focus was to protect children from
their parents being duped or forced into making their children
vulnerable to drug-dealing, terrorist pedophiles, thus needing
concerned federal agents to 'save' their children.<BR>
Well, OK&#133;maybe that is a bad example, since that was the
plot of the first episode of the C-16 TV series about an elite
FBI team.
<P>
The more the Real Guy tried to find examples of LEA's being portrayed
realistically, whether local, state, federal or military, the
more it became obvious that he would be unable to prove his non-conspiracy
theory directly, since the entertainment media's portrayal of
them was so obviously one-sided.<BR>
Instead, he decided to point out the flip-side of the argument-namely,
that if there indeed was a secret conspiracy linking the secret
government and the mainstream media, then they would not allow
the conspiracy theorists to also state their case in a subtle,
subliminal manner on the airwaves of America.
<P>
Yes&#133;that was the way to go.<BR>
Rather than trying to prove a negative, he would provide positive
proof that the wild-eyed conspiracy theorists were also allowed
media exposure to promote their own view of reality and virtual
reality.
<P>
Well, not The Real Guy, himself, since he was not really suited
to the task, but ? the Lunatic would be more than up for the job.
<BR>
He headed back for the telephone booth where he had left his clothes,
taking along the aluminum foil hat that would allow ? the Lunatic
to work without outside interference. It was going to be a long
night, but at least he had plenty of Scotch and butts to help
counterbalance any side effects that ? the Lunatic's medication
might be having on him.
<P>
In an important project such as this, balance was important.<BR>
