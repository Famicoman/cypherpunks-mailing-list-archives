&gt;          Organized Crime Advisory Board
&gt;
&gt;SUBJECT:  Paper Terrorism
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It  has   been  brought  to  my  attention  that  anti-government
&gt;organizations  have   been  utilizing   a  tactic  called  "paper
&gt;terrorism" to  effectively disable  government.  Commonly, public
&gt;officials are  personally targeted.   This widespread practice is
&gt;accomplished by  overburdening our  communications, business,  or
&gt;judicial systems with frivolous or repetitive petitions, property
&gt;liens, and small claims court actions.
&gt;
&gt;Enclosed is a brief explanation of this process.  If you feel you
&gt;are a victim of "paper terrorism," I encourage you to contact the
&gt;Washington State  Patrol, Organized  Crime Intelligence  Unit, in
&gt;Olympia at (360) 753-3277, for assistance.

&gt;Enclosure
&gt;
&gt;                         PAPER TERRORISM
&gt;
&gt;Introduction
&gt;
&gt;Since the  early 1990's  there has  been a noticeable increase in
&gt;the number  of people  across the  country who  have  joined  and
&gt;continue to  participate in  the anti-government movement.  These
&gt;individuals view themselves as victims of a government conspiracy
&gt;to take  away their individual rights and liberties.  They do not
&gt;recognize most forms of county, state, and federal government and
&gt;therefore create  their own  self-styled  government.    National
&gt;speakers in  the anti-government extremists or "Patriot" movement
&gt;conduct recruitment  and information  seminars across  Washington
&gt;State, as  well as  the  entire  country.    These  seminars  and
&gt;recruitment  meetings   fuel  bizarre   conspiracy  theories  and
&gt;communicate  new  trends  within  the  anti-government  movement.
&gt;Paper terrorism  has grown  from a  trend to  a full scale tactic
&gt;used upon  businesses, private  individuals, government  services
&gt;and elected officials.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Background
&gt;
&gt;Paper terrorism  is designed  to clog  government  services  with
&gt;meaningless requests  which consume  time and  disrupt schedules.
&gt;In the  private sector  paper terrorism  is an  attempt to extort
&gt;money, goods  or services.   Some  examples  of  paper  terrorism
&gt;activities:
&gt;
&gt;*    Bogus liens  placed upon  personal  property  of  government
&gt;     officials and private individuals.
&gt;
&gt;*    Frivolous lawsuits filed in state and federal courts against
&gt;     businesses and government entices [sic].
&gt;
&gt;*    Drafting and  passing  counterfeit  bank  checks  and  other
&gt;     fraudulent negotiable  instruments aimed  at defrauding  the
&gt;     financial community and businesses.
&gt;
&gt;*    Common Law Courts that issue homemade subpoenas to citizens,
&gt;     businesses and government officials.
&gt;
&gt;*    Challenging judges  in an  effort to  disqualify them  on  a
&gt;     current case and to repeat their motions to disqualify these
&gt;     judges from  hearing future  cases by  referencing the prior
&gt;     challenges.
&gt;
&gt;*    Scheming to  avoid paying  state sales tax during a purchase
&gt;     by declaring  to be  a non  resident and  then filing claims
&gt;     with the state's risk management section if refused.
&gt;
&gt;*    Disrupting  the  court  system  by  persuading  fellow  jail
&gt;     inmates to defend themselves as Patriots, thus tying up more
&gt;     of the courts and prosecutors time.
&gt;
&gt;*    Distributing the  extremist Citizens Handbook to foster jury
&gt;     nullification.
&gt;
&gt;*    using the  Internet  to  promote  extremist  ideas  such  as
&gt;     "Assassination Politics"  or predicting the date of death of
&gt;     a law  enforcement officer  or government  official to win a
&gt;     cash price.
&gt;
&gt;*    Filing bogus claims in small claims court.
&gt;
&gt;*    Requesting information  from  courts,  government  agencies,
&gt;     elected officials  and businesses  in the  form of frivolous
&gt;     questions in an effort to consume employee's time.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Tell-tale signs of Patriot extremists can often be found in their
&gt;conversation  or   written  documents.    Common  indicators  are
&gt;biblical passages,  referring  to  the  state  as  a  "republic",
&gt;calling zip codes a "postal zone", refusing to acknowledge direct
&gt;questions, separating their middle and last names with a comma or
&gt;colon, placing  a thumb  print on  a document, claiming the court
&gt;has no  authority, or  using the  phrases:   all rights reserved,
&gt;without prejudice,  UCC 1-207,  pro se, sui juris, united states,
&gt;Black's law.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Analysis and Trends
&gt;
&gt;These anti-government  extremists and  supporters  are  convinced
&gt;citizens  are  being  systematically  oppressed  by  an  illegal,
&gt;totalitarian government.   They  believe the time for traditional
&gt;political reform  has passed,  that their  freedom will  only  be
&gt;secured  by  resistance  to  the  law  and  attacks  against  the
&gt;government in several forms.
&gt;
&gt;Members of these groups bond to one another and lose contact with
&gt;other people who hold different opinions.  The isolation works to
&gt;reinforce their  views, which  in turn  gives them  new  purpose.
&gt;This new purpose may take ordinary ideas to extremes, rationalize
&gt;their problems  into blaming  government, and  cause  members  to
&gt;compete with each other to make stronger statements.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Trend and Incident Reporting
&gt;
&gt;If  you   become  victimized  by  paper  terrorism,  contact  the
&gt;Washington State  Patrol Organized  Crime  Intelligence  Unit  at
&gt;(360) 753-3277,  extension 121.   All  acts reaching  a  criminal
&gt;level should  be referred to your local law enforcement agency or
&gt;prosecutor's office.
