&gt;           Preparing the Remnant for the far side of the crisis
&gt;
&gt;Vol. 24, No. 9                 590              September 5, 1997
&gt;
&gt;       I am hereby lifting the copyright of this issue of
&gt;       Remnant Review.  This one I want you to send to your
&gt;       friends, neighbors, boss, Congressman, and anyone
&gt;       else who might want advance information on the end,
&gt;       at long last, of the 16th Amendment: vetoed by Year
&gt;       2000 noncompliant computers.  Photocopy it, print it,
&gt;       whatever.  Then visit my Web site for full documen-
&gt;       tation (under "Government"):
&gt;
&gt;THE ULTIMATE TAX REFORM: JANUARY 1, 2000
&gt;
&gt;     What I am about to report will verify what I have been saying all
&gt;year.  If this doesn't constitute proof, I don't know what can persuade
&gt;you.  From this point on, anyone who tells you that the Millennium Bug
&gt;is not a big deal, or who says, "We'll just have to wait and see about y2k,
&gt;there's no need to hurry," simply doesn't know what he's talking about.
&gt;Ignore him.
&gt;
&gt;     On August 21, I stumbled into the most amazing government
&gt;document I have ever seen.  I had read a brief news story about a
&gt;company that had applied for a contract to work as a subcontractor for
&gt;the IRS in a restructuring of its computer systems.  The IRS admitted to
&gt;Congress last January that its $4 billion, 11-year attempt to modernize
&gt;its computer systems had failed.  Here was a follow-up story.  So, I went
&gt;to the company's Web site to find more information.  This led me on a
&gt;merry chase across the Web.
&gt;
&gt;     Finally I landed on the IRS's page -- specifically, its page
&gt;relating to
&gt;its PRIME project.  There were pages of blue links to documents, each
&gt;one with a strange name or the name of a state.  It was not clear to me at
&gt;first what I had discovered.  So, I started clicking links. I found
&gt;nothing that I could understand, link after link: government bureaucratese.
&gt;Then I hit pay dirt: the mother lode, my friends -- what we have been
&gt;waiting for since 1913.  Deliverance.  Free at last, free at last!  THE
&gt;IRS'S MAINFRAME COMPUTERS -- 63 OF THEM, PLUS MICROCOMPUTERS -- ARE ON
&gt;THE BRINK OF TOTAL COLLAPSE.  Yee-hah!
&gt;
&gt;     This amazing admission appears in an innocuously titled document,
&gt;"Request for Comments (RFC) for Modernization Prime Systems
&gt;Integration Services Contractor" (May 15, 1997).  The author is Arthur
&gt;Gross, Associate Commissioner of the IRS and Chief Information
&gt;Officer, i.e., the senior IRS computer honcho.  It was Mr.  Gross who
&gt;went before Congress in January to admit defeat.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Gross now says that the IRS is no longer capable of operating its
&gt;own computer systems.  The IRS has over 7,500 people involved in just
&gt;computer maintenance, with a budget a $1 billion a year (Appendix B.
&gt;p. 2), yet they can no longer handle the load.  And so, says Mr. Gross,
&gt;some of them are going to get fired.  You can imagine the continuing
&gt;morale problem that this announcement will cause!  The IS (information
&gt;systems) division will be, as they say, DOWNSIZED.  From now on, the
&gt;IRS must achieve the following:
&gt;
&gt;           . . . shifting the focus of IS management to a
&gt;           business orientation: servicing customers with
&gt;           exponentially increasing technology needs,
&gt;           implementing massive new technology applications
&gt;           on schedule within budget while managing the
&gt;           downsizing of the IS organization
&gt;           (Appendix B. p. 2).
&gt;
&gt;     Do you think that people slaving away in their cubicles, trying to fix
&gt;the Millennium Bug, will respond favorably to this notice?  "Fix it, and
&gt;then you're out!"  Mr. Gross knows better.  So, with this amazing
&gt;document, he calls on private industry to come in and TAKE OVER
&gt;THE ENTIRE IRS COMPUTER DIVISION.  This is what Mr. Gross
&gt;calls "a strategic partnership" (p. 1).  The new partners will have to fix
&gt;the Millennium Bug.  The IRS will give them exactly eight months, start
&gt;to finish: October 1, 1998 to the end of June, 1999.
&gt;
&gt;                     The IRS's Digital Augean Stables
&gt;
&gt;     Perhaps you have had trouble on occasion getting information from
&gt;the IRS about your account.  After reading this document, I now know
&gt;why.   The information is held in what the IRS calls "Master Files" (p.
&gt;4).  These files are held in the Martinsburg, West Virginia, computer.
&gt;This computer receives data sent in by 10 regional centers that use a
&gt;total of 60 separate mainframes.  These mainframes do not talk to each
&gt;other.  Or, as Mr. Gross puts it, they are part of "an extraordinarily
&gt;complex array of legacy and stand-alone modernized systems with
&gt;respect both to connectivity and inoperability between the mainframe
&gt;platforms and the plethora of distributed systems" (p. 4).  This is
&gt;bureaucratese, but I do understand the word, INOPERABILITY.
&gt;
&gt;     The tax data build up in the local mainframes for five business days.
&gt;Then they are uploaded to West Virginia.  This may take up to 10 actual
&gt;days.  Then the Martinsburg computer sends it all back to the regional
&gt;computers in the Service Centers.  Then the information is made
&gt;available to the "Customer Service Representatives" (p. 5), i.e., local tax
&gt;collectors.  The elapsed time may take two weeks.
&gt;
&gt;     But . . . it turns out that the actual source payment documents are
&gt;not sent to the Master Files.  Neither is "specific payment or tax
&gt;information."  This information stays in what the IRS calls
&gt;STOVEPIPED SYSTEMS, meaning stand-alone data bases "which, for
&gt;the most part, are not integrated with either the Master Files or the
&gt;corporate on-line system, IDRS" (p. 5).  Separate tax assessments for the
&gt;same person can appear in six separate systems, and these do not
&gt;communicate with each other (p. 5).  "Further, each system generates
&gt;management reporting information which is not homogeneous, one with
&gt;the other . . ." (p. 7).  To help us visualize this mess, and much larger
&gt;messes, the document includes charts.  These charts are so complex that
&gt;my printer was unable to print out the 116-page document -- probably
&gt;not enough RAM.  I had to get two other people involved to get one
&gt;readable copy.
&gt;
&gt;     I have included one of these charts on the back page, just for fun.
&gt;Go ahead.  Take a quick look.  No need to get out your magnifying glass
&gt;just yet.   Then comes the key admission: "These infrastructures are
&gt;largely not century date compliant . . ." (p. 11).  The phrase "century
&gt;date compliant" is the government's phrase for Year 2000-compliant.  In
&gt;other words, THE IRS'S COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO CRASH.
&gt;Now hear this:
&gt;
&gt;          In addition to three computing centers, (Memphis,
&gt;          Detroit and Martinsburg) the latter of which is a
&gt;          fully operational tax processing center, the IRS
&gt;          deploys a total of sixty mainframes in its ten
&gt;          regional service centers.
&gt;
&gt;          None of the mainframes are compliant, thereby
&gt;          necessitating immediate actions ranging from
&gt;          systems software upgrades to replacement (p. 9).
&gt;
&gt;It gets worse:
&gt;
&gt;          A still greater and far reaching wave of work
&gt;          in the form of the Century Date Project is
&gt;          cascading over the diminishing workforce that
&gt;          is already insufficient to keep pace with the
&gt;          historical levels of workload.  For the Internal
&gt;          Revenue Service, the Century Date Project is
&gt;          uniquely challenging, given the aged and non-
&gt;          century compliant date legacy applications and
&gt;          infrastructure as well as thousands of undocumented
&gt;          applications systems developed by business personnel
&gt;          in the IRS field operations which are resident on
&gt;          distributed infrastructures but not as yet
&gt;          inventoried (p. 13).
&gt;
&gt;     Notice especially two key words: "undocumented" and "inventoried."
&gt;"Undocumented" means there is no code writer's manual.  They either
&gt;lost it or they never had it.  "Inventoried" means they know where all of
&gt;the code is installed.  But it says: "not as yet inventoried."  How much
&gt;code?  Lots.
&gt;
&gt;          The IS organization has inventoried and scheduled
&gt;          for analysis and conversion, as required, the
&gt;          approximately 62 million lines of computer code
&gt;          comprising the IRS core business systems.  With
&gt;          respect to the business supported field
&gt;          applications and infrastructures, however, we do
&gt;          not know what we do not know.  Until central field
&gt;          systems and infrastructures are completed, the IRS
&gt;          will be unable to analyze, plan, and schedule the
&gt;          field system conversion (p. 13).
&gt;
&gt;     I love this phrase: WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE DO NOT
&gt;KNOW.  This is surely not bureaucratese.  Now, let's put all of this into
&gt;a clearer perspective.  The Social Security Administration discovered its
&gt;y2k problem in 1989.  In 1991, programmers began to work on
&gt;correcting the agency's 30 million lines of code.  By mid-1996, they had
&gt;completed repairs on 6 million lines (CIO Magazine, Sept. 15, 1996.)
&gt;Got that?  It took five years for them to fix 6 million lines.  But the IRS
&gt;has 62 million lines THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT, but they don't know
&gt;about the rest.  It's out there, but there is no inventory of it.
&gt;
&gt;     Consider the fact that they have not completed their inventory.  The
&gt;1996 "California White Paper," which is the y2k guide issued by the IS
&gt;division of the California state government's y2k repair project, says that
&gt;inventory constitutes 1% of the overall code repair project.  Awareness
&gt;is 1%.  So, after you get finished with inventory, YOU HAVE 98% OF
&gt;YOUR PROJECT AHEAD OF YOU.  Meanwhile, the IRS has not yet
&gt;completed its inventory.
&gt;
&gt;     The IRS has led the American welfare state into a trap.  The Federal
&gt;government, like the U.S. economy, will be restructured in the year
&gt;2000.  Most Americans will be in bankruptcy by 2001, but they will be
&gt;free.
&gt;
&gt;     Meanwhile, the news media are all a-dither about the Clinton-
&gt;Congress accord on taxes, which will balance the budget in 2002.  As
&gt;George Gobel used to say, "Suuuuuure it will."  Who is going to collect
&gt;revenues in 2000?
&gt;
&gt;                   Please Help Get Us Out of This Mess!
&gt;
&gt;     The next section of Mr. Gross's report I find truly unique. When was
&gt;the last time you read something like this in an agency's report on its
&gt;own capacity?  (The next time will be the first.)
&gt;
&gt;          THE CHALLENGE: THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (IS)
&gt;          ORGANIZATION LACKS SUFFICIENT TECHNICAL
&gt;          MANAGEMENT CAPACITY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY
&gt;          SUPPORT TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT, EFFECTUATE THE
&gt;          CENTURY DATE CONVERSION AND MANAGE
&gt;         MODERNIZATION (p. 13).
&gt;
&gt;     This states the IRS's problem clearly: its computer systems are just
&gt;barely making it now, and the Year 2000 Problem will torpedo them.
&gt;
&gt;          Mr. Gross then announces the IRS's solution: quit.  The IRS has
&gt;now admitted that "tax administration is its core business" and it will
&gt;now "shift responsibility for systems development and integration
&gt;services to the private sector . . ." (p. 54).  But first, it must find
&gt;some well-heeled partners.
&gt;
&gt;     "The IRS has acknowledged that its expertise now and in the future
&gt;is tax administration."  This means that "the IS organization must be
&gt;rebuilt to preserve the existing environment and partner with the private
&gt;sector to Modernize the IRS" (p. 13).  I love it when someone capitalizes
&gt;"Modernize."  Especially when it really means "officially bury."
&gt;
&gt;     Then the coup de grace: "Any reasonable strategy to move forward,
&gt;therefore, would focus on managing the immediate crisis -- 'stay in
&gt;business' while building capacity to prepare for future Modernization"
&gt;(p. 14).  Then comes part 2 of the report:
&gt;
&gt;                         The Next Eighteen Months:
&gt;                          Staying in Business and
&gt;                        Preparing for Modernization
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Gross knows that there is a deadline, and it isn't 2000.  It's
&gt;months earlier.  He has selected June, 1999.  Most organizations have
&gt;elected December, 1998.  This allows a year for testing.  Mr. Gross is
&gt;more realistic.  He knows late 1998 is too early.  The IRS can't do it.  (I
&gt;would say that late 2008 is too early.  The IRS has tried to revamp its
&gt;computer system before.)
&gt;
&gt;     . . . the IRS must undertake and complete major infrastructure
&gt;initiatives no later than June 1999, to minimally ensure century date
&gt;compliance for each of its existing mainframes and/or their successor
&gt;platforms.  At the same time, the IRS must complete the inventory of its
&gt;field infrastructures as well as develop and exercise a century date
&gt;compliance plan for the conversion replacement and/or elimination of
&gt;those infrastructures. (p. 19).
&gt;
&gt;     Then comes an astounding sentence.  This sentence is astounding
&gt;because it begins with the word, IF.  (Note: RFC stands for Request for
&gt;Comment.)
&gt;     IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS BECOMES
&gt;AVAILABLE, UPDATES WILL BE PROVIDED TO POTENTIAL
&gt;OFFERERS TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPING RESPONSES TO THE
&gt;RFC.
&gt;
&gt;   If...? IF...?  He is warning all those private firms that he is inviting
&gt;in to clean up the mess that they may not be given the code analysis.  But
&gt;code analysis constitutes the crucial 15% of any Year 2000 repair job,
&gt;according to the California White Paper.  Then, and only then, can code
&gt;revision begin.
&gt;
&gt;     Meanwhile, the IRS system's code is collapsing even without y2k.
&gt;The programmers are not able to test all of the new code.  Mr.  Gross
&gt;calls this "Product Assurance."  This division, he says, has "sunk to
&gt;staffing levels less than 30 percent of the minimum industry standard . .
&gt;.. ."  This makes it "one of the highest priorities within the IS
&gt;organization, given that, today, major tax systems are not subjected to
&gt;comprehensive testing prior to being migrated to production" (p. 15).  In
&gt;short, Congress passes new tax code legislation, and the IRS
&gt;programmers implement these changes WITHOUT TESTING THE
&gt;NEW CODE.  Now comes y2k.  As he says, "the Century Date
&gt;Conversion will place an extraordinary additional burden on the Product
&gt;Assurance Program."  I don't want to bore you, but when I find the most
&gt;amazing government document I've ever seen, I just can't stop.  Neither
&gt;could Mr. Gross:
&gt;
&gt;     Regrettably, the challenge is far more overarching: to modernize
&gt;functioning but aged legacy systems which have been nearly irreparably
&gt;overlaid by and interfaced with a tangle of stovepiped distributed
&gt;applications systems and networked infrastructures (p. 55).
&gt;
&gt;     I'll summarize.  The IRS has got bad code on 63 aging mainframe
&gt;systems, plus micros.  It has lost some of the code manuals.  It does not
&gt;know how much code it has.  It must now move ("migrate") the data
&gt;from these y2k noncompliant computers -- data stored in legacy
&gt;programs that are not y2k compliant -- to new computers with new
&gt;programs.  These computers must interact with each other, unlike
&gt;today's system.  Bear in mind that some of this code -- I have seen
&gt;estimates as high as 30% -- is written in Assembler language, which is
&gt;not understood by most programmers today: perhaps 50,000 of them,
&gt;worldwide (Cory Hamasaki's estimate).  Then everything must be tested,
&gt;side by side, old system vs. new system, on mainframe computers, before
&gt;anyone can trust anything.  (This assumes that extra mainframes are
&gt;available, but they aren't.)  Warning:
&gt;
&gt;     Beyond the magnitude of the applications system migration, the
&gt;complexity and enormity of the date conversion that would be required
&gt;necessitates careful planning and risk mitigation strategies (e.g.,
&gt;parallel processing).  While the risks inherent in Phase III may be nearly
&gt;incalculable given the age of the systems, the absence of critical
&gt;documentation, dependency on Assembler Language Code (ALC) and
&gt;the inevitable turnover of IRS workforce supporting these systems, it is
&gt;essential to plan and execute the conversion of the Master Files and its
&gt;related suite of applications (p. 30).
&gt;
&gt;     I'll say it's essential!  The key question is: Is it possible?  No.
&gt;
&gt;     Can you believe this sentence?  "The risks inherent in Phase III may
&gt;be nearly incalculable . . ."  What does he mean, "may be"?  They ARE.
&gt;
&gt;    Meanwhile, Congress keeps changing the Internal Revenue Code.
&gt;This creates a programming nightmare: coding the new laws.  So, how
&gt;big is this project?  Here is how Mr. Gross describes it: "Modernization
&gt;is the single largest systems integration undertaking in world eclipsing
&gt;in breadth and depth any previous efforts of either the public or private
&gt;sector.  Given the fluid nature of the Nation's Tax Laws, Modernization
&gt;is likely to be the most dynamic, creating even greater complexity and,
&gt;in turn, compounding the risks" (p. 54).  Many, many risks.
&gt;
&gt;     Two questions arise: (1) Who is going to fix it?  (2) At what price?
&gt;The answer?  He has no answer.  All he knows is that this project is so
&gt;huge that NORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING WILL NOT WORK.
&gt;For this project, the IRS is not saying what its "partners" will be paid.
&gt;It's open for negotiation.
&gt;
&gt;     You may be thinking: "Boondoggle."  I'm thinking: "Legal liability
&gt;in 2000 larger than any company's board of directors would rationally
&gt;want to risk, unless they think Congress will pass a no-liability law in
&gt;2000."  Here is Mr. Gross's description of the special arrangement.  Pay
&gt;close attention to the words "competitive process."  He bold faces them; I
&gt;do, too.
&gt;
&gt;     Our challenge, therefore, is to FORGE A BUSINESS PLAN AND
&gt;     PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP in accordance with federal
&gt;     governmental procurement laws and regulations ABSENT THE
&gt;     TRADITIONAL LEVEL OF DETAILED REQUIREMENTS
&gt;     TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED AS THE BASIS OF THE
&gt;     COMPETITIVE PROCESS (p. 60).
&gt;
&gt;     He calls on businesses to create a "DETAILED SYSTEMS
&gt;DEVELOPMENT PLAN" (p. 60).  He goes on: "In general, the IRS
&gt;seeks to create a business plan which: Shares risk with the private
&gt;sector; Incents [incents???!!!] the private sector to either share or
&gt;assume the 'front end' capital investment . . ." (p. 60).  Read it again.
&gt;Yes, it really says that.  THE IRS WANTS THE PRIVATE SECTOR
&gt;TO PUT UP MOST OR ALL OF THE MONEY TO FIX ITS ENTIRE
&gt;SYSTEM.
&gt;
&gt;     This is why the minimum requirement for a company to make a bid
&gt;is $200 million in working capital.  It has to have experience in
&gt;computers.  It must be able to repair 5 million lines of code (p. 70).
&gt;
&gt;     How complex is this job?  The complexity is mind-boggling: a seven-
&gt;volume "Modernization Blueprint."  To buy it on paper costs $465, or
&gt;you can get a copy on a free CD-ROM.  Needless to say, I got the CD-ROM.
&gt;
&gt;     So, you think, at least the IRS is getting on top of this problem.
&gt;Suuuuure, it is.  The contract award date is [let's hear a drum roll,
&gt;please]: October 1, 1998 (p. 73).  How realistic is this?  You may
&gt;remember Mr. Gross's deadline: June 1999.  So, he expects these firms
&gt;to be able to fix 62 million lines of noncompliant code, if they can find
&gt;the missing code in the field offices, even though the IRS has lost the
&gt;documentation for some of this code, in an eight-month window of
&gt;productivity.  Social Security isn't compliant after seven years of work
&gt;on less than half the IRS's number of lines of code.
&gt;
&gt;     The IRS is facing a complete breakdown.  Its staff can't fix the code.
&gt;The IRS wants private firms to pay for the upgrade and manage the
&gt;computer systems from now on.  It does not know how much code it has.
&gt;It does not have manuals for all of the old code.  It does not even know
&gt;how to pay the firms that get the contracts: either by "contractually
&gt;greed upon fees" or "pursuant to measurable outcomes of the
&gt;implemented systems" (p. 61).  It has called for very large and
&gt;experienced firms to submit comments by October 1, 1997.
&gt;
&gt;     In short, the IRS does not know what it is doing, let alone what it
&gt;has to do.  It only knows that it has to find a few suckers in private
&gt;industry
&gt;to bear the costs of implementing a new, improved IRS computer system
&gt;and then assume responsibility for getting it Year 2000-compliant
&gt;between October 1, 1998 and the end of June 1999.  ("There's one born
&gt;every minute.")  Here are 12 companies that have expressed interest:
&gt;nderson Consulting, Computer Sciences Corporation, EDS
&gt;Government Services (EDS is not itself y2k compliant), GTE
&gt;Government Systems, Hughes Information Technology Systems, IBM,
&gt;Litton PRC, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrup Grumman
&gt;Corporation, Ratheon E-Systems, Tracor Information Systems
&gt;Company, and TRW.  The list is posted at:

&gt;                                Conclusion
&gt;
&gt;     It's all over but the shouting.  The IRS is going bye-bye.
&gt;Accompanying it will be the political career of Mr. Gingrich and the
&gt;historical reputation of Mr. Clinton.  Bill Clinton will be remembered as
&gt;the President on whose watch the Federal government shut down and
&gt;stayed shut down.  First Mate Newt will try to avoid going down with
&gt;the ship of state, but he won't make it.  And as for Al Gore . . . .  Well,
&gt;maybe he can get a job herding cattle on the Texas ranch of his ex-
&gt;roommate at Harvard, Tommy Lee Jones.  Think of it: not "Gore in
&gt;2000," but GORED IN 2000.  Mr. Information Highway will hit a dead end.
&gt;
&gt;     On June 30, 1999, the IRS will know that its computers are still
&gt;noncompliant.  On the next day, July 1, fiscal year 2000 rolls over on
&gt;the Federal government's computers and on every state government's
&gt;computer that has not rolled over (and shut down) on a bi-annual basis
&gt;on July 1, 1998.  Almost every state: about half a dozen will roll over on
&gt;October 1, 1999.
&gt;
&gt;     In 1999, chaos will hit the financial markets, all over the world --
&gt;assuming that this does not happen earlier, which I do not assume.  The
&gt;public will know the truth in 1999: THE DEFAULT ON U.S.
&gt;GOVERNMENT DEBT IS AT HAND.  The tax man won't be able to
&gt;collect in 2000.  The tax man will be blind.  Consider how many banks
&gt;and money market funds are filled with T-bills and T-bonds.  Consider
&gt;how the government will operate with the IRS completely shut down.
&gt;Congress hasn't thought much about this.  Neither has Bill Clinton.
