   I sent a copy of this post to a buddy of mine who retired from the
CIA not too long ago ... these were his comments on the matter; FWIW.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But legal experts say it could be a difficult lawsuit to
&gt;&gt;&gt;win, especially since an employer - in this case the
&gt;&gt;&gt;government - generally has a right to listen to employee
&gt;&gt;&gt;conversation on office phones.
&gt;
&gt;They're right.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;It also doesn't help that national security was involved
&gt;&gt;&gt;and that courts have held that U.S. citizens don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional rights overseas.
&gt;
&gt;Completely wrong. No court has so ruled; the writer is confusing 
&gt;the Bern Convention, signed by almost every nation on earth, which 
&gt;formally establishes the the rule of "lex loci," or law of the land 
&gt;where the individual is found. This is only a common-sense 
&gt;restatement of old principles of Roman AND common law, whereby a 
&gt;national of country X can never act with impunity in country B. 
&gt;It's as old as Hammurabi. There is NO "ruling" that establishes 
&gt;that an American citizen forfeits his Constitutional rights 
&gt;vis-a-vis the United States Government, and to claim otherwise is 
&gt;to insult the truth. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;``It's an uphill battle. It's going to be a tough suit,'' said
&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional law expert Paul Rothstein of Georgetown
&gt;&gt;&gt;University.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe so. But it'll be fun to watch. We've known for years now that 
&gt;the jackbooted thugs of the DEA are by far the most law-abusing, 
&gt;disrespectful, rights-sneering, down-and-dirty, life-threatening, 
&gt;hair-raising agents of the entire US Government. Bar none. They've 
&gt;got to be watched, because they're a nasty threat to individual 
&gt;liberty, and because they routinely interfere with the legitimate 
&gt;work of other American intelligence agencies. (And they've been 
&gt;monitored, by the way, since at least 1984, to my knowledge.) 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;"It is not the CIA's mission, nor is it part of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;operations of the agency, to surveil in any manner
&gt;&gt;&gt;U.S. officials, or other U.S. citizens at home or
&gt;&gt;&gt;abroad,'' Mansfield said.
&gt;
&gt;Well, that's the kind of in-your-face lying that brings deserved 
&gt;contempt down on the heads of the intelligence community. I disdain 
&gt;it, and have done so publicly. The sonofabitch needs to say openly 
&gt;that you're damned right the CIA and NSA do this, and here's WHY we 
&gt;do it... 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The only exception would be in counterintelligence
&gt;&gt;&gt;cases, he added, and then only in consultation with
&gt;&gt;&gt;senior Justice Department officials.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah. A GS-12 giggler.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;In Horn's previous case, Leighton said, the Justice
&gt;&gt;&gt;Department angered DEA agents by claiming they
&gt;&gt;&gt;have no Fourth Amendment constitutional right
&gt;&gt;&gt;against wiretapping when working outside the
&gt;&gt;&gt;country.
&gt;
&gt;See? The ignorance of DEA agents is legendary!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Leighton, a former federal prosecutor, said the
&gt;&gt;&gt;lawsuit doesn't address the reasons for the alleged
&gt;&gt;&gt;electronic eavesdropping.
&gt;
&gt;Ever heard of Title 18 of the US Code, stupid one?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;"My assumption is because they want to know
&gt;&gt;&gt;what DEA is doing, they want to rip off DEA
&gt;&gt;&gt;informants, they want to know DEA contacts
&gt;&gt;&gt;within foreign governments,'' Leighton said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;``And with the Cold War over, these agencies
&gt;&gt;&gt;are looking for a new mission.''
&gt;
&gt;Nice try, slick. But it ain't so much the desire for their network 
&gt;as it is a desire to prove that a huge number of DEA agents have 
&gt;been involved in drug-running and foreign government corruption for 
&gt;at least 14 years now. Like that?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Horn's residence ``was the target of a U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Government Agency-sponsored electronic audio
&gt;&gt;&gt;intercept,'' it said.
&gt;
&gt;I'd love to be on the stand here. I'd LOVE to hear this arrogant 
&gt;schmuck try and "prove" that the "tap" (if there ever was one) was 
&gt;of US origin! What an ignorant ass...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;"Horn had occasion to see a cable containing
&gt;&gt;&gt;his words in quotation marks, that he had spoken
&gt;&gt;&gt;to another DEA agent, set forth exactly as stated...''
&gt;
&gt;Tsk tsk. Imagine that. And of course it just never occurs to the 
&gt;fool that we can also derive such intel from third-party sources 
&gt;and governments. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The suit, assigned to U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene,
&gt;
&gt;Oh, yea! The same trigger-happy judge that fathered the infamous 
&gt;AT&amp;T dismemberment! 
&gt;  Hoo-boy!
