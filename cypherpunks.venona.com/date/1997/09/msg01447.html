"Did you notice the way 'Mojave' was misspelled?" the Shadow asked the Rich
Man.

Bad BillyG nodded slowly, looked up at the Shadow and said, "I also noticed
that he used the 'replay' remailer and spoke of 'deja vu.'"

"Indio?" the Shadow asked Bad BillyG, not having to wait for his
confirmation to know that the anonymous writer was referring to the
Wackenhut/Cabazon weapons fencing operation.

"I've got someone checking the physical site as we speak," BillyG told the
Shadow, "but I think it's obvious that the references to Lefty and the
tassel-haired young woman firing a shotgun with one hand means that these
people recreated an event that happened over a decade and a half ago, only…"

Bad BillyG paused to swallow, "…only this time, the targets are us, not
them."

The Shadow and his earthly compatriot turned their attention to the
anonymous post, once again, confirming what they already knew, and scanning
for more details of the writers veiled message, therein.

[Not-News NetWork-- Mohave Desert] Aug 4/97

WHAT DOES A FIVE HUNDRED POUND GORILLA READ AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE? - sog

The "Not-News Gorilla NutWork" was rocket-launched in the Mohave Desert
early yesterday morning by a rag-tag bunch of paramilitarist computer
gurus who unveiled an InterNet Bill of Bytes that included the words,
"MicroSoft shall make no laws..."

Angered by a self-appointed council of computer industry magnates who
have announced their intention to seize fascist control of the quickly
burgeoning Information Highway by controlling the definition of all
information, the rebels set up a shooting range which contained a wide
variety of targets ranging from copies of the Wall Street Journal to
life-sized cardboard cut-outs of a hooded figure referred to only as,
"a billionaire to be named later."

A Che Guerva look-alike named Lefty (a nickname changed from "Lucky"
after a laboratory accident took three of the fingers on his right
hand) spoke openly about the group's loose-knit plans to impose their
own ratings system on corporations who have "taken it upon themselves
to decide what is news and what is not--what is information and what
is obscenity."

"We have decided on two classes of ratings." explained a tassel-
haired young woman as she slid shells into a Winchester Defender
sitting on her lap. "On..." she said, lifting the shotgun with one
hand, then liberating the hooded head from a nearby cardboard cut-out,
before turning back to say, with a Cheshire grin, "...and off."

The wide array of luxury automobiles and high-end computer gear on
display at the gathering lent credence to the claim of a quiet older
man whose only comment during my presence was, "The people here
probably have a combined access to more soft targets than the NSA."
He turned to punctuate his statement, as many others did that day,
with a volley of fire that penetrated targets carrying the corporate
logos of a variety of big-name players in the computer industry.

Surprisingly, the conversation consisted almost totally of issues
surrounding privacy, self-determination and freedom from censorship,
with hardly a word being spoken about potential plans of action by
individuals or the group. As the quiet man's equally quiet wife
spoke in what seemed to be a deathly whisper, telling me, "Everyone
here knows what they have to do.", a man with a crude, homemade
rocket-launcher sent a flaming projectile into the side of a small
propane tank several hundred feet away, as if punctuating the last
and most meaningful statement of the day.

After quietly dispersing a few minutes later, the group packed up
their weapons and climbed into their vehicles without a word between
them, each seemingly going their own separate ways.

I stayed on after the last of the others had left, reflecting on the
fact that I had arrived at this gathering by virtue of a late-night
phone call to my unlisted number, and found that I knew none of the
participants in the activities.

I had the strangest feeling that the others there had arrived by the
same anonymous process as I had, and I wondered if they were equally
mystified as to who had arranged this impromptu assembly of apparent
strangers joined in a common cause. Immediately, one of the pickup
trucks driving away backfired, and I thought of synchronicity, knowing
that the truck would backfire once again, which it immediately did,
before disappearing quietly out of sight.

Climbing into my own vehicle, I took a last look at the site, which
had been cleaned and left exactly the way it was when I had first
arrived on the scene. I experienced a moment of deja vu, as if I had
just arrived and none of what I had experienced that day had truly
transpired.

Somewhere in the distance, a vehicle backfired...

not even certain that I should be speaking about the event...but I am.

A Player To Be Named Later put down the 'Not-News Gorilla NutWork
Rocket-Launched' post and scanned portions of the INSLAW/Octopus report from
NaziWorld, once again.

The INSLAW Octopus
Software piracy, conspiracy, cover-up, stonewalling, covert action: Just
another decade at the Department of Justice
By Richard L. Fricker
…
But prior to his arrest in 1991, Riconosciuto provided the Hamiltons with an
affidavit that once again brought Brian into the Inslaw picture. "I engaged
in some software development and modification work in 1983 and 1984 on
proprietary PROMIS computer software product," he stated. "The copy of
PROMIS on which I worked came from the US Department of Justice. Earl W.
Brian made it available to me through Wackenhut (a security company with
close FBI and CIA connections) after acquiring it from Peter Videnieks, who
was then a Department of Justice contracting official with the
responsibility for PROMIS software. I performed the modifications to PROMIS
in Indio, Calif.; Silver Springs, Md.; and Miami, Fla."

The modifications included a telecommunications "trap door" that would let
the US Government eavesdrop on any other organization using the pirated
software, Riconosciuto said.

…

Although Brian denies any involvement with Inslaw or Riconosciuto, the House
Judiciary Committee received a report from a special task force of the
Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff's Office and District Attorney, stating
that on the evening of Sept. 10, 1981, arms dealers, buyers and various
intelligence operatives gathered at the Cabazon Indian Reservation near
Indio, Calif., for a demonstration of night warfare weapons. The
demonstration was orchestrated jointly by Wackenhut and the Cabazon Indian
tribe. (Many published reports allege that the Wackenhut/Cabazon joint
venture served as a weapons fencing operation for Oliver North's Iran-
Contra dealings.)

Bad BillyG involved in that mess?
A Player To Be Named Later shook his head negatively, to himself. It seemed
unlikely, but it would explain a few things which had been troubling him,
lately. And it would mean that the anonymous poster knew enough intimate
details of an event that had been shrouded in deep secrecy to pose a threat
to all those connected with the Indio affair.
It would also explain the apparently strange ending to a major play by the
news and computer industry heavyweights calling themselves the 'Internet
Content Coalition' that the anonymous post seemed to be threatening.

For starters, Microsoft made an immediate about-face, within hours of the
anonymous post, on their plans to include technology supporting the Internet
Content Coalition's aims in their next version of Internet Explorer.

There wasn't much doubt that 'Nobody' was pointing out to one and all that
the Internet Content Coalition was under siege, and that the opening salvo
by 'Anonymous' had brought the largest corporation in history to its knees,
in surrender.
A bold claim, but would this declaration of war in the battle of the giants
to seize control of the official reigns of news and information on the
InterNet be backed up in the end, by across the board results?

A Player To Be Named Later pored over a FreeAmerica report on the
resurrection of the Inslaw ghosts in the mid-1990's.

Federal Corruption
INSLAW

Copyright FreeAmerica and Harry V. Martin, 1995

Congressman Jack Brooks of Texas has opened a new investigation into the
INSLAW case. Brooks is investigating allegations that Justice Department
officials, including Meese, conspired to force INSLAW into bankruptcy in
order to deliver the firm's software to a rival company. The rival firm,
according to court records and law enforcement officials, was headed by Earl
W. Brian, a former Cabinet officer under then California Governor Ronald
Reagan and a longtime friend of several high-ranking Republican officials.

[Earl W. Brian! Who had seized control of United Press International (UPI)
in a deal every bit as shady as the Inslaw affair…]

On March 21, 1992, [Michael] Riconoscuito stated in an affidavit to the
Court and Congress, and before he was arrested, the following:

   * During the 1980s he served as the Director of Research for a joint
     venture between the Wackenhut Corporation of Coral Gables, Florida, and
     the Cabazon Band of Indians of Indio, California. The joint venture was
     located on the Cabazon reservation.

[Near the Salton Sea, a long-time haunt of the Author, who brought a strange
variety of computer gurus to the area, purportedly for Corvina fishing, but
what was the real story about their travels there?]

   * The Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture sought to develop and/or
     manufacture certain materials that are used in military and national
     security operations, including night vision goggles, machine guns,
     fuel- air explosives, and biological and chemical warfare weapons.
   * The Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture was intended to support the needs
     of a number of FOREIGN governments and forces, including forces and
     governments in Central America and the Middle East. The Contras in
     Nicaragua represented one of the most important priorities for the
     joint venture.
   * The Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture maintained close liaison with
     'certain elements' of the United States Government, including
     representatives of intelligence, military and law enforcement agencies.
   * Among the frequent visitors to the Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture were
     Peter Videnieks of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.,
     and a close associate of Videnieks by the name of Earl W. Brian. Brian
     is a private businessman who lives in Maryland and who has maintained
     close business ties with the U.S. intelligence community for many
     years.
   * The purpose of the PROMIS software modification that I made in 1983 and
     1984 was to support a plan for the implementation of PROMIS in law
     enforcement and intelligence agencies worldwide. Earl W. Brian was
     spearheading the plan for this worldwide use of the PROMIS computer
     software.
   * Some of the modifications that I made were specifically designed to
     facilitate the implementation of PROMIS within two agencies of the
     Government of Canada: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the
     Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS). Earl W. Brian would
     check with me from time to time to make certain that the work would be
     completed in time to satisfy the schedule for the RCMP and CSIS
     implementations of PROMIS.

[The RCMP and CSIS…the same entities that the Author had shared a Russian
language class with in Regina, Saskatchewan, just before the Moscow
Olympics. Who had he encountered in that group who would later be
instrumental in acquiring the PROMIS software for the Canadians?]

   * The propriety version of PROMIS, as modified by me, was, in fact
     implemented in both the RCMP and the CSIS in Canada. It was my
     understanding that Earl W. Brian had sold this version of PROMIS to the
     Government of Canada.

A Player To Be Named Later suddenly remembered the email to the CypherPunks
mailing list and the corporate headquarters of the Internet Content
Coalition that had been forwarded from the LMBoyd Website, which was known
to be a forum for the Circle of Eunuchs to send veiled messages to set the
stage for their more pointed attacks on the Dark Forces.
It was an email that was sent out when the dark specter of the Internet
Content Coalition first began to flex their muscles.

"Of course!"

A Player To Be Named Later slapped his forehead, amazed that he had not seen
the connection sooner between the 'mass murderer, serial killer stalking
humans from the North' email, the Not-News threat singling out "a
billionaire to be named later," and the email sent to the Internet Content
Coalition players just before they held the meeting where they effectively
folded their hand in their attempt to take over control over defining what
was 'official' news on the InterNet, and what was not.

He reread, once again, the anonymous post sent just hours before the
Internet Content Coalition's grand agenda bit the dust:

"In July, Anson Ng, a reporter for the Financial Times of London
was shot and KILLED in Guatemala. He had reportedly been trying
to interview an American there named Jimmy Hughes, a one-time
director of security for the Cabazon Indian Reservation secret projects.
"In April, a Philadelphia attorney named Dennis Eisman was found
DEAD, killed by a single bullet in his chest. According to a former
federal official who worked with Eisman, the attorney was found dead
in the parking lot where he had been due to meet with a woman who
had crucial evidence to share substantiating Riconosciuto's claims.
"Both Eisman's and Ng's deaths were declared 'suicides' by
authorities.
"Fred Alvarez, a Cabazon tribal leader who was in vocal opposition
to the developments on the reservation, was found SHOT TO DEATH
WITH TWO FRIENDS in 1981. Their murder remains unsolved.

At last, the whole bizarre, implausible scenario finally came together in A
Player To Be Named Later's mind.

The Author's presence near the belly of the beast in Indio had not been a
mere coincidence. When the Internet Content Coalition made their move, the
Circle of Eunuchs already had the information they needed to connect several
of the players in the proposed news cartel with the trail of deaths
surrounding both those involved in the INSLAW debacle and the reporters
closing in on the real story involved.
And they had made it more than plain that some of those involved in the
Wackenhut-Cabazon arms deals were now playing for the opposition…and that
bullets don't discriminate between the rich and the poor.

A Player To Be Named Later was still mystified as to how the Magic Circle
had been able to pull off such a bold, in-your-face maneuver on some of the
Titans of the news and computer industries.
In the early days, after the dissemination of "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre"
had begun in 1989, the Circle of Eunuchs had come under fierce attack from a
variety of sources from within the secret government hunting them.
Mysterious deaths, established careers going up in flames, overnight. The
Magic Circle had quickly disappeared far into the underground of computer
society.
Then, the Circle had begun to show their hand, more and more, now reaching
the point where they could apparently do battle with the heavyweights
working behind the scenes with Gomez and the Dark Allies. But A Player To Be
Named Later hadn't seen any indication that the Circle of Eunuchs had
managed to gain possession of a hole-card that could account for…unless…

"Casolaro!" A Player To Be Named Later whispered, as if speaking the name
aloud might bring down fire from the heavens. Quickly, he did a disk search
for a vaguely remembered article from Conspiracy Nation…

THE OCTOPUS
===========
By Karen Bixman
(For The People *News Reporter*, 11/14/94)
…
On the morning of August 11, 1991, Danny Casolaro was found dead
in the bathroom of his hotel room at the Sheraton Hotel in
Martinsburg, West Virginia. His wrists had been slashed ten
times; his briefcase and notes were missing. The authorities
labeled the death a suicide, and before Casolaro's family had
been contacted, the body was embalmed.

absolutely nothing in the subject line of the message.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Damn! He had nailed it!

Karen Bixman's article had confirmed everything that A Player To Be Named
Later had increasingly suspected as his mind pored over the mountain of
information which had seemed so tentatively, but treacherously, related.
Bixman had laid down an utterly astounding, twisted trail of closely
connected, mysterious deaths and blatant murders surrounding the INSLAW and
Iran-Contra misdeeds that completed the connections between the past and
current players in the battle for control of world supremacy in computer
information and communications.

What's more, the timing of the disappearance of Danny Casolaro's extensive
notes on the winding serpent of evil surrounding these affairs coincided
with the Magic Circle's unmistakable reentry into manifest participation in
the battle against the Evil One and the Dark Forces under his command.

The Coupe de Gras, however, was the source of the Conspiracy Nation
newsletter.
Prairienet.org! From whence sprang the apparently unrelated Bureau42 clique
who had seized the opportunity to host 'The True Story of the InterNet'
transcripts, despite the troubled and bloody history of those who had done
so in the past.
Bianca had mentioned to Mike Denney, at Basis Inc., that she had been
prepared to hack the Bureau42 servers when they came under attack upon
placing 'Part II' and 'Part III' on their system, but that they had managed
to clear up the problems that developed on their own, and had done so in a
surprisingly short period of time.

Only one thing was still bothering A Player To Be Named Later.
Microsoft had been the first member of the Internet Content Coalition to
publicly fold their hand in the battle to control news and information
ratings across the InterNet, but Gates seemed, on the surface, to be less
visibly connected to the extremely messy past misconduct of the others, and
thus seemed to have the least to lose if the shit hit the fan.
Gate's quick concession to the veiled threats had definitely been the
catalyst in causing the hasty retreat of the other members of the news
cartel that had seemed to be on the drawing board for quite some time in the
plans of Gomez and the Dark Allies…but why?

Bill Gates had not become the richest and most overtly powerful individual
on the face of the earth by fighting against the grand designs of the Evil
One, but he seemed to be playing his cards close to his chest, in a manner
that suggested that he had an agenda of his own that might not run exactly
parallel to that of the Dark Forces.

What was BillyG's game?
A Player To Be Named Later had been involved in the grand battle taking
place behind the scenes of everyday reality for long enough to know that it
was all done with mirrors.

"And each man, in his time, plays many parts." he said, perplexed for the
moment.

"To Shakespeare!" A Player To Be Named Later said, lifting his glass in
toast. "A member of the Magic Circle, if there ever was one."
"If there ever was one…" he repeated, smiling at his unintentional inside
joke.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shadow was watching Bad BillyG closely, for any sign of subterfuge in
his inner demeanor.
"You're certain about Blanc Weber?" he asked, once again.

"Well, I could be wrong, but we've investigated her thoroughly, and every
indication is that all that nonsense about her development of the HydroCube
is just that-nonsense."

BillyG shrugged his shoulders, apparently unconcerned with what he regarded
as a small, internal company matter.
"I could have her isolated, but I don't really see much point. If she is
hiding something, then it's probably better not to let her know how closely
she is being monitored. Perhaps you should put some of the Dark Allies on
her tail for a while, in case there is something that my people have
missed."

"No, I don't think that will be necessary." the Shadow replied, casually.
He had instructed his men to monitor Blanc Weber's movements and activities
months ago, as well as those of the spooks Bad BillyG had assigned to watch
her. His own spooks had likewise turned up nothing positive, but he had
pressed the matter with Gates in order to judge his reaction just the same.

"Well, her digital implant went according to plan," BillyG added, "so we
will be able to yank her chain on a moment's notice, if it becomes necessary
to do so, in the future."

The "billionaire to be named later" sat back and allowed himself to indulge
in the luxury of looking forward to the moment when A Player To Be Named
Later would find out much, much more than he really wanted to know about Bad
BillyG's plans for the tattered remnants of the Magic Circle who were
attempting to interfere with his own vision of the direction the future of
the InterNet should take at this nadir point in time, when the battle for
control of virtual reality was about to explode into every single facet of
human life
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bubba Rom Dos thought about the forefather of his technical namesake, who
had so far managed to walk with the Evil One as far as the bridge in his
rise to riches, fame and power a hundred years in the past.
The Cowboy, Priscilla, Alexis, Jonathan, and d'Shauneaux were likewise
joined with him in contemplation of this paradoxical figure from the past
whose role in the great battle between the Forces of Light and the Forces of
Darkness had remained an enigma throughout the history and legends of the
Circle of Eunuchs.

Friend or foe, there was no denying that Billy the Kid was going to play a
major role in the direction that the thundering train of history was about
to take as it approached the crossroads of destiny on its way to an
ElectroMagnetic Future where freedom would hinge on the free flow of Taoist
bytes routing around the enslaving chains of Fascist bits that Gomez and the
Dark Allies had been carefully laying in place since the dawn of the
Computer Era.

Bubba Rom Dos, sage and savant, deviant and derelict, raised a glass of
"Bubba's Special Reserve" in toast, proclaiming as the tattered remnants of
the Magic Circle joined him in his libations, "To Billy the Kid…or Bad
BillyG…to the things that he did…or to what he may be…"

The Trei Transponder began softly humming in the background, as if trying to
tell the small assembly something very, very important for them to know.
Then it fell silent…
