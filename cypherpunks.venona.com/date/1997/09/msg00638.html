&gt; You miss the point entirely. This is =not= supposed to be a democracy. That 
&gt; is why we have a constitution (theoretically a set of restrictions upon the 
&gt; powers of government), and bill of rights. 

This is most certainly a democracy, it's called a representative democracy.
That we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights is a measure of the
founding fathers wisdom but by no means are either required to have a
democracy, nor do either by definition eliminate a governmental form from
being a democracy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. In a democracy, you can't have property rights because 51% can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; capriciously decide to confiscate anyone's property.

That depends on how the founders define the democracy. The definition of a
democracy does NOT define the system put in place merely who has a say in
how it runs.

You're painting with way too broad a brush. Like most things simply being a
cat does not equate all cats to be the same. This also applies to
democracies, there is plenty of room to manuever when designing it.

&gt; &gt; Since there are no true democracies extant your point is moot.
&gt;  
&gt; There have been, that is why the point is not moot. The point is, we are 
&gt; becoming one, with the advent of instant polling and politicians and 
&gt; citizens who obviously can't read as simple a document as the constitution.

Where? When? No government ever implimented by man has ever been a true
anything. Not democracy, communism, etc. They are all hybrids of one sort or
another.

For there to be a true democracy as you seem to define it we would require
every man, woman, and child to carry a vote and be required to vote on each
and every issue. No government in history has had this much prosperity or
homogoneity in the desires of the people.
