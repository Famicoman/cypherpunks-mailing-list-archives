&gt; &gt; 	There is also a clear difference between shooting a guy carrying

&gt; Anyone can construct scenarios where the distinction is as fuzzy as
&gt; you please -- eg -- your best friend is getting you a new stereo for
&gt; your birthday, and is arranging a surprise. 

	Yeah, and most people are pretty good at figuring these things out.
If you saw your best friend carrying your stereo out of your house, you'd
wonder why, but you wouldn't shoot him. 

&gt; Ambiguous situations are a ubiquitous feature of reality.  You may 
&gt; think in black in white, but the world is not only many shades of 
&gt; gray -- it's a parade of color.

	Nope. Black and white. White is _all_ colors. Black is none. Any
grey you see is a failure of resolution.

&gt; &gt; 	Well, the current system stinks, but enough people are buffalo'd into
&gt; &gt; thinking that it works, so it is doubtful that it will get better.
&gt; People are not "buffalo'd" -- they are happy with a system that gives 
&gt; them a good life.  Therefore, it has to get worse before it gets 
&gt; better.  

	Crap. If anyone is happy with this system, they are either on the
top, or not paying attention. 

&gt; &gt; If on the 
&gt; &gt; otherhand the system ceased to exist, maybe it could be improved.
&gt; Ah yes -- libertopia.

	We're fucked as it is. It wouldn't be much worse.
