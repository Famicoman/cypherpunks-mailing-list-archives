I was under the impression that using a SSN for identification purposes was
illegal.  A while back I went to a company that rented sound equipment to
pick up some equipment for a job, and was asked for my SSN as part of my
credit application.  I told them that I believed that it was illegal to
require an SSN and they said, in effect, if you want to rent from us, you
have to give us your SSN.  

When I got home, I called the Social Security Administration office in
Austin and after being bounced around among lots of people who knew
absolutely nothing about the subject, I finally reached someone who
informed me that this practice is perfectly legal as long as you're not
&gt;required&lt; to give your SSN.  Since I didn't, in theory, have to do
business with these folks, they therefore apparently had every right to
require my SSN as a condition of doing business with them.  In point of
fact, when the incident occurred, it was getting late, I had to have the
equipment for my job, and so I gave them what they wanted.

At 09:35 PM 9/10/97 -0500, Jim Choate did speak as follows....
&gt;&gt;Questions: Is this for real?  How wide spread is this?  What does U-Haul
do
&gt;&gt;with your SSN? How difficult is it for someone (company) to get your SSN
&gt;&gt;when you use your credit card?
&gt;
&gt;Did you ask if it was a U-Haul requirement or a Texas one?
&gt;
&gt;If you've ever given your SSN when applying for a credit card,
&gt;you can be pretty sure they've got your SSN in the credit report.
&gt;Perhaps if you've got a secured debit card of some sort
&gt;you've been able to keep it separate from your other credit history,
&gt;if any, but most people have slipped at least once, or had an account
&gt;at a bank that collected the SSN for tax reasons and then included it
&gt;in credit reports.
