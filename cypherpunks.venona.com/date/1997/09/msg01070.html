Subject: !!! DEATH THREAT !!!
<P>
William,<BR>
I have taken the liberty of sending a death threat to someone
and <BR>
forging your name and digiture to it. (No need to thank me, I
just <BR>
like to help out.)<BR>
I don't usually take this kind of arbitrary action (unless I'm
<BR>
running low on meds) but I thought drastic measures were called
for<BR>
when I came across evidence that your name is about to be sullied
and <BR>
your business endangered, due to a plot between a psychotic lunatic
<BR>
and an employee of yours who is an agent for a secret organization
<BR>
which has been responsible for inspiring and supporting a wide
range<BR>
of anti-technological terrorists, including the UnaBomber and
the <BR>
genius behind the PS/2.
<P>
Who are these people, you ask? (I have extremely good ears.) 
<BR>
Bubba Rom Dos, TruthMonger and Blanc Weber.<BR>
All card-carrying members of the Circle of Eunuchs.
<P>
I have long suspected that a series of underground manuscripts
titled<BR>
'The True Story of the InterNet' had, as their ultimate aim, the
total<BR>
destruction of MicroSoft. 
<P>
Sure enough, in Part III of the series, &quot;InfoWar,&quot; the
author, known as<BR>
TruthMonger, suggests:<BR>
~~~<BR>
&quot;Video_World, and TV_World. Those were the titles we had
put to Part II <BR>
of 'The True Story of the InterNet.' But that was before the censorship
<BR>
crisis on the CypherPunks mailing list, when we saw the sticky,
tangled <BR>
tentacles that lay at the root of the World Wide Web.<BR>
&quot;And before Gomez began to build his Evil Empire on the cornerstone
of<BR>
WebTV.&quot;<BR>
~~~<BR>
<P>
Part II, &quot;WebWorld &amp; the Mythical Circle of Eunuchs,&quot;
reveals the <BR>
role played by Blanc Weber in her subversive intentions to help
in the<BR>
destruction of MicroSoft, with the goal of promoting her own secret
technologies. <BR>
~~~<BR>
Apparently, HydroCube storage technology had been in existence
for some <BR>
time before its official announcement by BabyGates Technology.
The Kid, <BR>
as she was called, had been the daughter, lover, or employee of
the <BR>
richest man in the world, depending on which version of this era
you<BR>
believed. Her star had risen, even as Microsoft's star had begun
to <BR>
fall, mostly as a result of her development of the HydroCube,
with its <BR>
nearly infinite data-storage capacity. <BR>
<B>&#133;<BR>
</B>And now, Jonathan had reason to believe that the Kid had actually
been <BR>
a member of the CypherPunks, masquerading under the pseudonym
of <BR>
Blanc Weber.<BR>
~~~<BR>
<P>
So, as you can plainly see, it is only a matter of time before
these<BR>
self-proclaimed Freeh-&gt;dumb Fighters decide to begin openly
attacking<BR>
you with slanderous truths about yourself, Gomez and the Dark
Allies,<BR>
the lady midget wrestler and the bed full of chickens, as well
as the <BR>
role of Susan Canizales as your dietary aide.
<P>
Yes, I know...you are shaking in your boots at the prospect of
these<BR>
facts coming out (complete with 4&quot;x8&quot; color graphics),
but there *are*<BR>
actions you can take to thwart these dire possibilities.<BR>
Fortunately, Part III is being released on the cypherpunks@toad.com
<BR>
mailing list, under the TruthMonger multi-user persona, who has
formed<BR>
a secret alliance with the Cypherpunks' distributed persona, Anonymous.
<BR>
Thus, if you act quickly, you might be able to strike first, writing
<BR>
your own chapter of Part III and sending it to the Cypherpunks
list,<BR>
anonymously, copyrighting it as &quot;TruthMonger &lt;billg@microsoft.com&gt;&quot;
<BR>
in order to piss in the face of the known list forger who is known
to<BR>
be responsible for many of the chapters submitted. (Then you could
sue<BR>
the bastard!)
<P>
In *your* chapter, you could give yourself any role you desired
in the<BR>
history, present and future of humankind.<BR>
My suggestion would be to beat these rapscallions to the punch
by using<BR>
the Taoist tactic of creating 'yourself' as an evil creature of
your<BR>
own design--far more diabolical than even your enemies could imagine.
<P>
The Circle of Eunuchs would then be honor-bound, as cross-matchers
<BR>
(under NLP theology), to assign you a role as a secret hero in
a later<BR>
chapter, thus saving you the embarrassment of having to blow your
own<BR>
horn to keep the Universe in balance.<BR>
Sameer, president of C2Net, is reportedly under heavy medication
<BR>
by his physician as the result of the stress of trying to think
of <BR>
something positive he can say about himself and his organization,
<BR>
under the savage attacks against his corporation and his private
person<BR>
by these evil conspirators.
<P>
In conclusion, I would add that it is traditional to reward/torture
<BR>
the masochistic, paranoid schizophrenic who supplies many of the
more<BR>
bizarre of the CoE's conspiracy theories, by adding some subtle
hint<BR>
pointing to some future event in history, based on your own inside
<BR>
knowledge. (The point being to make it glaringly obvious to crazed
<BR>
conspiracy theorists, but something that will make them look like
a <BR>
'lunatic' if they try pointing it out to normal people.)<BR>
An AT&amp;T employee once made a prophetic claim in the series
to an event<BR>
which proved to be true in concept, way off-base in details, except
that<BR>
he inserted a reference to the Message ID number of the future
email<BR>
he foresaw, and then released the announcement months later with
a<BR>
Message ID that was the reverse of the foretold one...<BR>
<P>
Beware of white lipstick,<BR>

<P>
The wild-eyed, disheveled figure sat hunched over the keyboard
of his laptop, frantically seeking meaning in the words that lay
before him.
<P>
<I>&quot;Hello, Dimitri. How are you feeling today?&quot;</I>
<P>
The mad doctor furtively lowered the screen on his laptop, hiding
his important work from the prying eyes of his patient.
<P>
<I>&quot;Hello, Igor.&quot; </I>Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM said,
eyeing the patient suspiciously.
<P>
<I>&quot;Please, call me Igor.&quot; </I>the Kremlin spy replied,
causing Dr. Vulis to quickly search his mind and memory to recall
their conversation to this point. Nothing there&#133;
<P>
Igor Chudov eyed the evil Doctor's laptop suspiciously, raising
his eyebrows ever so slightly, but enough so that Dimitri could
tell exactly what he was thinking. He could even tell what the
patient's next words would be, in regard to his excess use of
power in the 'Home' to run his spambots.
<P>
Igor, speaking softly, then raising his voice as he leaned closer
and closer to Dr. Vulis, asked, <I>&quot;We wouldn't be writing
a <B>letter </B>about our <B>good friend, SAMEER, would we?</B>&quot;</I>
<P>
Dimitri jumped up in terror, clutching the laptop to his breast.
They knew! They knew about his regression into his paranoid C2Net
conspiracy theories. <BR>
Now they would punish him again, possibly even going so far as
to make him install the Windows operating system on another of
his UNIX boxes. Dimitri steeled himself for the patient's verdict.
<P>
Igor relaxed, sat down on the edge of the table, and said, casually,
<I>&quot;Just kidding, Dimitri. I know that you're working on
your EFF material.&quot;<BR>
</I>Dimitri eyed Igor suspiciously, but Igor merely continued,
<I>&quot;Don't worry Dimitri, I am in favor of your creation of
the Electronic Forgery Foundation.&quot; </I>He couldn't resist
adding, <I>&quot;Very clever of you to plant all of that evidence
pointing toward Toto as the source of the plethora of forgeries
to the CypherPunks list.&quot;</I>
<P>
A shit-eating grin spread across Dr. Vulis' face as he realized
that, this time, he had been caught for doing something he wouldn't
be punished for. Rewarded, perhaps? <BR>
Cautiously, Dr. Vulis asked Igor, <I>&quot;So can I have more
medication? All of the others in treatment here are getting better
drugs than me, because they are patients being treated by doctors.
Why am I the only doctor being treated by a patient?&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Now Dimitri,&quot; </I>Igor shook his head, negatively,
<I>&quot;you are exaggerating again. You know that John Young
and Robert Hettinga are the only two here who are getting better
drugs than you, and it is only occasionally, when they share a
room, and then only in order to increase their pleasure when they
engage in&#133;uuhhh&#133;CypherPunk activities.&quot;</I>
<P>
Dimitri got angry, as Igor knew would result from feeding his
fantasies, <I>&quot;I know what you're talking about!&quot; </I>Dimitri
always got&#133;uuhhh&#133;'excited', when this subject came up.
<BR>
<I>&quot;They're sucking each other's <B>cocks</B>! This place
is full of <B>cocksuckers</B>, and the biggest one of all is cocksucker
<B>John </B>&lt;spit&gt;<B> Gilmore </B>&lt;fart&gt;<B>!</B>&quot;</I>
<P>
Igor enjoyed getting Dimitri worked up into a lather before leaving
him to continue with his openly-secret activities. As he closed
and locked Dr. Vulis' door, he shouted to him, <I>&quot;I'll have
Ray Arachelian look in on you a little later.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Keep that murdering Armenian bastard away from me!&quot;
</I>Dr. Vulis screamed in terror, before becoming distracted by
a passing fly and forgetting what it was that he was so angry
about.<BR>
No matter. He would get mad about something else, instead. After
all, he was a Freedom Knight. Being an angry, aggressive activist
fighting valiantly against petty nuisances that most people just
ignore was a Freedom Knight tradition.<BR>
Dr. Vulis opened up his laptop and bent over to attend to his
important work, once again.<BR>
<P>
Dimitri checked two names off of his list. The President, and
the Big Kid, BillyG.
<P>
Now that he had set up his unwitting shill, Toto&#133;? the Lunatic,
he reminded himself&#133;, by sending veiled threats to two of
the most powerful figures in the Freeh World, he would now begin
to close his evil, circuitous  trap by turning his attention to
pissing off other world leaders, with ? the Lunatic acting as
the exposed target, once again.<BR>
He had pissed off Apple Computers, as well, by attributing the
anonymous email to BillyG to an Apple employee. Now he would divert
suspicion 'from' himself by attributing this chapter of Part III
'to' himself, so that everyone would think that it must surely
be another forgery by ? the Lunatic.

Dear Saddam,
<P>
  Salman Rushdie is in hiding in Bienfait, Saskatchewan, living
under an assumed name after having had radical plastic surgery
to disguise his appearance.
<P>
  He is trying to redeem himself with Allah by building a nuclear
bomb with which to nuke D.C., but he is inadequate for the task.
However, do you remember Lee Harvey Oswald? If not, then surely
you are aware of Timothy McVeigh&#133;
