&gt;Showing my ignorance, what's the "real" censorware summit?

Check out <A  HREF="http://www.kidsonline.org/">http://www.kidsonline.org/</A>  -- it's a hoot. Praises the CDA as a
"well-intentioned effort to protect children." Grew out of the White
House's kickoff Censorware Summit in July; Clinton is expected to speak at
this one. Scheduled for Dec 1-3 here in DC. Chaired by former Clinton
campaign official and former FTC "protect the children" Commissioner
Christine Varney. (This is not to criticize Varney; I rather like her
personally, but politically, well...)

The Censorware Summit is organized largely by industy groups -- America
Online initially took the lead role -- and sympathetic advocacy groups.
Donna Rice-Hughes (yes that Donna Rice) is heavily involved, as operations
co-chair or something (I forget her real title). Sydney Rubin
(syd@kidsonline.org), a public relations rep for CyberPatrol, is handling
media registration. The Center for Democracy and Technology, which runs the
pro-censorware netparents.org site, is hosting the kidsonline.org site.

Following is a quote from the web site. Note it talks about how we need
stricter enforcement of obscenity laws -- one of the worst ideas I've heard
in a while. Remember Robert Thomas -- why should S.F. or NYC be subject to
the "community standards" of Tennessee? *sigh*

&gt;The summit will seek to advance the following objectives in accordance with
&gt;Presidential and Congressional statements on Internet use by children:
&gt;
&gt;       Technological Solutions: Encouraging market-based development and
&gt;       deployment of an effective, easy-to-use "digital toolbox" of user
&gt;       empowerment tools which can assist parents and others responsible for
&gt;       children, in shielding those children from material they deem
&gt;inappropriate
&gt;       and shaping children's communication and information options online; to
&gt;       enable access to positive content and communications based on
&gt;individual
&gt;       values; and to enable service and content providers, and others, to
&gt;create
&gt;       family-friendly environments.
&gt;
&gt;       Enforcement of Current Law: Fostering greater cooperation among
&gt;       law enforcement, industry, and the public, to support vigorous
&gt;       enforcement of existing laws against using the Internet to traffic
&gt;in obscene
&gt;       material and child pornography, stalk children, and commit other
&gt;crimes.

Fortunately there's a coalition forming to oppose this. That is,
emphasizing the free speech implications of rating and filtering proposals.
I understand details will be made public soon. As I said:

&gt;&gt;Look for the usual suspects to stand up and wave around censorware
&gt;&gt;programs, blissfully ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court ruled
&gt;&gt;recently that the Net should be as free as print or a public square. Last I
&gt;&gt;checked, print publishers would never endorse any "self-labelling" system
&gt;&gt;to stave off Federal censorship. They'd have the balls to stand up and
&gt;&gt;fight. So should the Net.

-Declan
