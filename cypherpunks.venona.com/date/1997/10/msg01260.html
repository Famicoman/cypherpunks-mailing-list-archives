&gt;                   INTERNET TO RELENTLESSLY DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY
&gt;                                        
&gt;    Reuters
&gt;    24-OCT-97
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    By Neil Winton, Science and Technology Corresdpondent LONDON, Oct 24
&gt;    (Reuters) - Information technology is being lauded as the surprise
&gt;    provider of ever increasing wealth without inflation.
&gt;    
&gt;    Economists in the United States are scratching their heads to solve a
&gt;    problem which the busineses schools suggested was impossible.
&gt;    
&gt;    How is the U.S. economy still powering ahead in top gear with low
&gt;    unemployment without incurring inflation?
&gt;    
&gt;    Information technology is getting the credit, but productivity gains
&gt;    notched up from the use of computers have been overlooked by
&gt;    government statistics.
&gt;    
&gt;    As the Internet age gathers momentum companies around the world will
&gt;    be able to slash costs and gain access to markets which would have
&gt;    been impossibly expensive before.
&gt;    
&gt;    Last week Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said real
&gt;    productivity gains associated with computers and telecommunications
&gt;    may not have been fully realised yet.
&gt;    
&gt;    Information technology experts agree. ``The Internet makes smaller and
&gt;    remote companies look big and next door,'' said Bill Rosser, research
&gt;    director at the information technology consultancy Gartner Group in
&gt;    Stamford, Connecticut.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``You can put up your website and your products and bring a presence
&gt;    to a much broader market. Because of its rich delivery capacity a
&gt;    small company in Lichtenstein can win business from General Motors,''
&gt;    Rosser said.
&gt;    
&gt;    ECONOMIC IMPACT DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT
&gt;    
&gt;    The economic impact of information technology is undoubted, but
&gt;    difficult to pinpoint.
&gt;    
&gt;    The problem for economists is how to accurately measure output and
&gt;    productivity in service industries such as banking, law firms,
&gt;    software and services companies generally, which account for an ever
&gt;    increasing percentage of the U.S. and other wealthy economies.
&gt;    
&gt;    It was relatively easy to add up the number of widgets produced and
&gt;    divide the cost by the number of workers employed, but it's not so
&gt;    easy to measure the impact of information technology.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``It's hard for economists to figure this out. I think it's really
&gt;    based on problems with measuring how companies use IT to reduce the
&gt;    number of people needed to do certain tasks,'' said Eilif Trondsen,
&gt;    research director at consultants SRI International in Menlo Park,
&gt;    California.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``Companies like GE (General Electric Co ), and Cisco Systems Inc are
&gt;    finding ways of doing things with a fraction of the people they used
&gt;    to need, using the Internet,'' Trondsen said.
&gt;    
&gt;    GE is one of the U.S.'s biggest companies with major businesses in
&gt;    power generators, appliances, lighting, plastics, medical systems,
&gt;    aircraft engines, financial services and broadcasting. GE earned net
&gt;    profits of $7.28 billion in 1996. Revenues were $79.2 billion.
&gt;    
&gt;    Cisco provides the ubiquitous equipment which links computers across
&gt;    telephone lines over the Internet, pumping electronic mail and digital
&gt;    data around the world. Last year revenues jumped 80 percent to around
&gt;    $4 billion.
&gt;    
&gt;    Bob Chatham, senior analyst at technology researcher Forrester in
&gt;    Cambridge, Massachusetts, points to novel ways that costs can be cut
&gt;    using computers.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``GE in its procuring of supplies and materials can save 15 to 20
&gt;    percent buying online. Some firms can reduce the cost of a purchase
&gt;    order from $45 to around a dollar fifty. New companies like Free
&gt;    Markets Online will run an (virtual) auction for you and cut costs
&gt;    about 22 percent,'' Chatham said.
&gt;    
&gt;    Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based Free Markets Online targets markets
&gt;    such as plastic injection moulding or metal casting in which hundreds
&gt;    of companies compete for contracts, and sets up virtual auctions using
&gt;    its software to make the cheapest possible deals.
&gt;    
&gt;    HOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HELPS BUSINESS
&gt;    
&gt;    SRI's Trondsen said the use of information technology can create a
&gt;    seamless flow of information through a company so that it can become
&gt;    more productive. Orders flow in and automatically trigger inventory
&gt;    and production decisions which have a big positive impact on
&gt;    productivity. Bills are settled electronically.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``The Internet helps companies find suppliers they didn't even know
&gt;    existed,'' according to Trondsen.
&gt;    
&gt;    Gartner's Rosser said IT can make more information available to
&gt;    workers to let them make decisions on their own where supervisors
&gt;    would have needed to intervene previously.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``It makes them smarter. It enlarges the jobs because they've got the
&gt;    data. You don't have to talk to the supervisor, you see it (the data)
&gt;    and bingo, take action,'' Rosser said.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``This is bringing huge improvements, but we are not seeing this in
&gt;    economic statistics. Now the future is with the Internet, that's what
&gt;    Greenspan was talking about,'' said Rosser.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``This is all about maximising the use of your intellectual
&gt;    capacity.''
&gt;    
&gt;    But won't all this labour saving technology result in huge swathes of
&gt;    unemployment around the world, and leave the competition in places
&gt;    like Europe in permanent second place?
&gt;    
&gt;    SRI's Trondsen said Europe will catch up, but more bureaucratic
&gt;    organisations which lack the necessary corporate culture will have
&gt;    problems.
&gt;    
&gt;    According to Rosser, short term upheavals will become long term
&gt;    benefits for all.
&gt;    
&gt;    ``Well yes, the buggy-whip makers will always go out of business. Most
&gt;    long term studies show lots of temporary problems, but ultimately we
&gt;    will get workers applied elsewhere to produce more goods and value
&gt;    added services,'' Rosser said.
