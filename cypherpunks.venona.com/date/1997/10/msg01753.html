&gt;Perception, not reality, is what is important here.  A wealthy

&gt;It's true, however, that you are probably better off with proof of
&gt;insurance than an expensive watch when being wheeled into the
&gt;emergency room.  (Except for your privacy, that is.)

Those deciding on admittance don't look for Rolexes (besides, fake Rolexes
sell for about $29 at any flea market).

What an insurance card is really a *line of credit*. Or a *proof of
payment*. The admitting hospital knows they'll at least be reimbursed for
the initial visit and emergency treatment.

By contrast, those lacking such a card may use all sorts of claims to avoid
payment fo the bill.

I certainly agree that there ought to be better ways to tell a hospital:

"Look, I can and will pay for treatment if you admit me to your emergency
room."

Even better,

"And I'd like to pay the "preferred rate," not the 3-4x inflated price you
publish as your "list price.""

However, at this time it looks like a Blue Cross or Blue Shield or
equivalent card is the only recognized way to meet these goals.

Perhaps there's a business idea for some enterprising Cypherpunk. A prepaid
hospital card, good for a few days' worth of treatment (e.g., $5000), but
only at the better rates. This could even be done with Chaumian
privacy-protecting methods. There's an idea.
