&gt;                      MORE DEFENDANTS ADOPT 'FREEMENSPEAK'
&gt;                                        
&gt;      Freemen in court
&gt;      
&gt;   It's gibberish to the judges
&gt;   
&gt;      October 25, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 6:33 p.m. EDT (2233 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      BILLINGS, Montana (AP) -- Standing scornful and defiant, the
&gt;      defendants shout their cases. They are sovereign citizens, not
&gt;      subject to the court! The judges are unqualified! The lawyers are
&gt;      illegal!
&gt;      
&gt;      "To hell with you and your kangaroo court!" one defendant bellows at
&gt;      his sentencing for dealing drugs.
&gt;      
&gt;      The bizarre claims are trademarks of the Montana Freemen, the
&gt;      militant anti-government zealots who have been jailed here, awaiting
&gt;      trial, since their 81-day standoff ended 16 months ago.
&gt;      
&gt;      But the claims are now coming from garden-variety criminals, fellow
&gt;      inmates in the Yellowstone County jail. These non-Freemen are
&gt;      proving to be ardent students of the convoluted legal fantasies of
&gt;      the jail's most famous residents.
&gt;      
&gt;      They are firing their lawyers, torpedoing their own plea agreements,
&gt;      writing their own legal briefs, arguing -- and losing -- their own
&gt;      cases. They are making life and work difficult, and often miserable,
&gt;      for those who run the court system.
&gt;      
&gt;      Chief public defender Sandy Selvey calls the Freemen a plague. At
&gt;      least seven clients of his office have tried "Freemenspeak" in state
&gt;      court; others have tried it in federal court.
&gt;      
&gt;      "They're contaminating our good criminals," says District Judge
&gt;      Diane Barz, who tangled with the Freemen as a federal prosecutor.
&gt;      
&gt;      About two dozen Freemen have been among the jail's 300 inmates since
&gt;      June 13, 1996, when they surrendered after an armed, 81-day standoff
&gt;      with FBI agents at their isolated farm compound in the remote
&gt;      outback of eastern Montana's "Big Open." Three minor figures have
&gt;      pleaded guilty, but trials for the rest won't begin until next
&gt;      spring.
&gt;      
&gt;      The host of federal charges against them include wire and bank fraud
&gt;      and threatening the life of a federal judge and other public
&gt;      officials. The FBI says some 800 people from around the country
&gt;      attended classes at the rural stronghold, learning to issue the
&gt;      worthless liens and "warrants" that the Freemen claim are legal
&gt;      tender.
&gt;      
&gt;      People in several states have been charged, and some convicted, of
&gt;      trying to use such documents, often bearing the name of Freeman
&gt;      leader Leroy Schweitzer. The Dallas Morning News reported that at
&gt;      least 151 people in 23 states were under investigation for Freeman
&gt;      connections.
&gt;      
&gt;      The Freemen's legal "philosophy" is a jumble of odds and ends from
&gt;      the Bible, the U.S. Constitution, the Magna Carta and the Uniform
&gt;      Commercial Code, the body of federal laws that govern interstate
&gt;      financial transactions.
&gt;      
&gt;      They dress it up in pseudo-scholarly terms and meaningless Latin
&gt;      phrases and claim, in essence, they are laws unto themselves -- and
&gt;      over everyone else.
&gt;      
&gt;      "There are some real gaps in their education, and ... I think they
&gt;      are darned close to acting like the mentally ill," Barz said.
&gt;      
&gt;      The Freemen commonly rant, belch, challenge the federal judges and
&gt;      get banished from the courtroom to watch on closed-circuit TV as
&gt;      appointed lawyers try to defend them. More conventional inmates soon
&gt;      started imitating them.
&gt;      
&gt;      Their verbose legal filings, often prepared by Freemen, are so
&gt;      peculiar that District Court Clerk Jean Thompson rejects many of
&gt;      them.
&gt;      
&gt;      Accused wife-murderer Jerry Swinney filed a 25-page "Demand for Bill
&gt;      of Particulars." Adopting the Freemen's name style -- Jerry period
&gt;      comma Swinney -- it opens this way:
&gt;      
&gt;      "Jerry., Swinney, Affiant, hereinafter at all times relevant,
&gt;      Demandant, a self-realized entity, a Man upon the free soil of the
&gt;      several American independent and sovereign states, ..."
&gt;      
&gt;      Twenty-five eye-glazing pages later, this is how it closes:
&gt;      
&gt;      "NOTICE. This instrument comes under, and brings into the instant
&gt;      action, the doctrines of res gestae, res ipsa loquitor, tacit
&gt;      procuration, prior knowledge, willful intent, as against YOU and you
&gt;      and your private characters. Further affiant sayeth not."
&gt;      
&gt;      County Attorney Dennis Paxinos, public defender Selvey and the
&gt;      judges say the biggest problem the Freemen imitators have created is
&gt;      how to protect themselves from themselves. It may be a bad idea for
&gt;      them to act as their own lawyer -- but it's their legal right.
&gt;      
&gt;      "The judges and prosecutors seem to be as concerned with protecting
&gt;      these Freeman-type people as their own attorneys are," says Deputy
&gt;      County Attorney Joe Coble. "The only people who seem to want to run
&gt;      roughshod over these people's rights are these people themselves."
&gt;      
&gt;      "The real concern I have is trying to figure out if, hidden among
&gt;      the rubble of rhetoric, there's any viable complaint or issue we
&gt;      really should consider," says District Judge G. Todd Baugh.
&gt;      
&gt;      As far as the judges can recall, that hasn't happened yet.
&gt;      
&gt;      "It's incredibly difficult to figure out what they're trying to
&gt;      say," says District Judge Russell Fagg.
&gt;      
&gt;      Judges usually appoint a standby lawyer, often over the defendant's
&gt;      protests.
&gt;      
&gt;      "Standby is the worst possible situation for a defense lawyer,"
&gt;      Selvey said. "You have to know all the facts, all the witnesses and
&gt;      what they'll testify to, all the forensic evidence, and the
&gt;      authorities the guy's going to cite.
&gt;      
&gt;      "And then you have to stand there and watch while he goes down in
&gt;      flames."
