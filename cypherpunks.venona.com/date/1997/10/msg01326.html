&gt;               G7 TO MEET IN AMAZON TO REVIEW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
&gt;                                        
&gt;      G7 graphic October 25, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 8:03 p.m. EDT (0003 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      BRASILIA, Brazil (Reuters) -- Brazil and the Group of Seven
&gt;      industrialized nations meet in the Amazonian capital of Manaus next
&gt;      week to agree on the next stage of a program promoting sustainable
&gt;      development in the rain forest.
&gt;      
&gt;      The annual meeting of G7 donors to the so-called Pilot Program
&gt;      (G7-PP), administered by the World Bank, begins formally on Tuesday,
&gt;      with Monday dedicated to presentations by Brazilian government
&gt;      officials of projects in the Amazon.
&gt;      
&gt;      "When we speak of the future, that means completing and
&gt;      consolidating current projects and thinking about Phase Two of the
&gt;      G7-PP," Brazilian Environment Minister Gustavo Krause said.
&gt;      
&gt;      Starting six years ago, the program has given out $181.3 million of
&gt;      a total of $250 million pledged to fund projects such as the
&gt;      demarcation of Indian reserves and protecting fishing communities
&gt;      from large-scale competitors.
&gt;      
&gt;      The rest is budgeted, one of the aims of the three-day meeting will
&gt;      be to identify new sources of money and coax fresh funds out of the
&gt;      participants -- Germany, the United States, the European Union,
&gt;      Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada.
&gt;      
&gt;      Germany has financed the bulk of projects, contributing 35 percent
&gt;      of the total and even more as the principal economic power in the
&gt;      European Union.
&gt;      
&gt;      The United States, despite spending pledges made by President
&gt;      Clinton on a visit to Brazil earlier this month, lags in fourth
&gt;      place, behind the EU and Japan.
&gt;      
&gt;      Environmental pressure groups said the most important aspect of the
&gt;      meeting is a proposal to establish zones in the gigantic Amazon
&gt;      river basin. Map of Brazil 
&gt;      
&gt;      They say Pilot Program managers are resigned to the fact Brazil will
&gt;      pursue large-scale infrastructure projects in the rain forest,
&gt;      including paving a road from Manaus to Venezuela and river-widening
&gt;      projects to boost soybean exports.
&gt;      
&gt;      "It seems important that the realities of the Amazon region and of
&gt;      its political weight and significance must be taken into account if
&gt;      effective conservation of at least a good part of the Amazon are to
&gt;      be achieved," the World Bank's Rain Forest Unit said in a memo.
&gt;      
&gt;      The infrastructure projects basically correspond to what the bank
&gt;      calls "development corridors" where the "objective is to increase
&gt;      and geographically concentrate economic activity."
&gt;      
&gt;      Such corridors would be counter-balanced by "conservation corridors"
&gt;      where biodiversity would be protected.
&gt;      
&gt;      In between, in so-called inter-corridor spaces, the Rain Forest Unit
&gt;      suggests policies should make sure economic activity that preserves
&gt;      as much of the forest as possible becomes more attractive than
&gt;      clearing land for agriculture.
&gt;      
&gt;      A concrete task set by the officials meeting in Manaus is to decide
&gt;      when Phase Two of the program will begin.
&gt;      
&gt;      They must also decide what type of transition is needed to blend
&gt;      Phase One projects into a broader, cohesive program that fits into
&gt;      the Brazilian government's plans for the region.
