&gt; &gt;In Canada, one could 'choose' not to work for Safeway Stores, but the
&gt; &gt;chain would come into a community and undersell everyone until the locals
&gt; &gt;were run out of business, then raise prices dramatically. In theory, you
&gt; &gt;could choose to *not* work for Safeway, but in reality, there was no one
&gt; &gt;else left *to* choose to work for in the grocery  business.
&gt; 
&gt; If they didn't buy products
&gt; from the Safeway or WalMart then you wouldn't have the "problem" above.
&gt; Economics 101; the people are voting with their wallets.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a prime example of the basis of socialism; envy. The socialist are
&gt; envious of the rich as they are a constant reminder of "what could have
&gt; been".
&gt;
&gt; The socialist never thinks of the hard work and personl sacrfise that goes
&gt; into creating a "Safeway" or "KMart" or "Walmart". Such companies are not
&gt; created by an act of GOD but through hard work and long hours by their
&gt; founders.

  Nothing personal, shit-for-brains, but this sounds like the 'standard
speech' you have prepared, waiting only for a 'trigger' before you fire
it off...

  I was making reference to the simple fact that 'Caveat Hemptor' still
rules, but does so with the backing of men who can afford to hire thugs
called policemen to back their action.
  My point is that Safeway has every right to bring their competition
to financial ruin, just as Nestle's has every right to give away their
baby formulae for free in impoverished countries, just long enough for
the mother's milk to dry up, at which time their babies die if they
can't afford to buy Nestle's product.
  I reserve the right, however, to whack their sorry asses out if 
I decide that my world will be a better place without their scheming
for their own profit at the expense of those who believe the fairy
tales they tell while planning to buttfuck the people all along.

  The rest of your post is proof that one should not read Ayn Rand
while high on acid, but I'm glad you could get all of that off your
chest, just the same.

  The point I was making, if you care to respond to it once the buzz
wears off, is that the 'playing field' has been twisted so far out of
askew that it is difficult to make any judgements about capitalism
versus socialism, etc., since the world is standing on its head.
  I sincerely doubt that 'capitalists' getting paid 'not to grow' 
cotton/corn/whatever, are a far cry different from the socialists
getting paid 'not to go to work.'

  There are no longer any capitalists or socialists, there are only
people projecting images with political rhetoric and ten-second
sound-bytes.
  I am beginning to think that the *only* way to level the playing
field is with a nuclear grader. (If only I could figure out where 
this damn yellow wire goes...)

&gt; After years of hard work, when the founders are finaly able to reap the
&gt; fruits of their toil, the socialist will step up and say: "I want what you
&gt; have, you can't have that because I don't" even though the socialist has
&gt; done nothing to earn it.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the true evil of socialism: "Equiality of Outcome". While the
&gt; socialist will make a big show of his desire for "equal opertunity" it is
&gt; really "equal outcomes" that he desires. It is like the story of the
&gt; grashopper and the ant. Both have the "equal opertunity" durring the
&gt; summertime to store up for the winter. The ant choses the path of the
&gt; capitalist and works hard all sumer long while the grasshopper choses the
&gt; path of the socialist and wastes the days away in play and folly. When
&gt; wintertime comes along the ant is well prepaired while the grasshopper is
&gt; without. While the capitalist will see the grasshopper getting his just
&gt; rewards for his foolhardy behavior the socialist will cry foul, seeing
&gt; this as unjust that the ant should have so much and the grasshopper so
&gt; little and demaniding that the ant give a portion of his "wealth" (a large
&gt; portion no doubt) to the grasshopper thus achiving his desired "equality
&gt; of outcome" even the grasshopper has done nothing to deserve such an
&gt; outcome.
