<PRE>
&gt; &gt;In the coming weekend, I'll be updating the newuser FAQ
&gt; &gt;(for things like PPP and 2.2). I'm sure a post-install checklist would be
&gt; &gt;a welcome addition.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;B U T . . . .
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not everyone runs things like Kerberos or DNS. Keep in mind that many
&gt; &gt;people use OpenBSD for many things and in many environs. The OpenBSD setup
&gt; &gt;on my firewall at the office is much different than the Sparc, Alpha, and
&gt; &gt;P5/133 I run it on at home. The setup on my router machine at home is also
&gt; &gt;much different than the other machines in my house. There are ways people
&gt; &gt;have setup OpenBSD on embeded systems to do things like manage the
&gt; &gt;fuel/air mix ratio on their Corvettes (OK, one person I know of planned
&gt; &gt;that, but couldn't get the financing for the car...) I hope that draws the
&gt; &gt;picture.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As for the verification after install, that is sort of "auto-manditory"--
&gt; &gt;if a filesystem isn't mounted right, /etc/fstab has to be checked out. If
&gt; &gt;the network doesn't work, the network files must be examined to "make it
&gt; &gt;go." As oopposed to attacking this as a checklist, how about it is
&gt; &gt;attacked as "If networking doesn't work, check hostname.(interface)"-- but
&gt; &gt;there is more to that then just files in /etc (boot -c in order to
&gt; &gt;reconfigure hardware addresses)
&gt; 
&gt; As a user of OpenBSD, and having tried to manage projects with it for
&gt; implementation of added features for customers...I could not agree with
&gt; the above position.
&gt; 
&gt; You see, if you are ALREADY familiar with OpenBSD then you will most likely
&gt; know exactly what to do when installing and seting up a system. New User's
&gt; Notes / Installation Checklist's will most likely be ignored by you.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if you are brand new to the system, then an Installation / Setup
&gt; Checklist (a good one) will prove to be essential. Wouldn't it be great if
&gt; just about every post to these groups from a new user was one like "..hey!
&gt; This OpenBSD thingy works great! The installation was a snap!.." or something
&gt; like that.  We all know that hardly happens now...but, it could.....
&gt; 
&gt; I, for one, believe strongly that a good 'Overview', 'Setup Notes' and 'Installation
&gt; Checklist' must somehow find it's way into the distribution. It is also clear
&gt; that the machine / arch specific differences will require unique versions
&gt; for each.

I completly agree with you. Just anoze topic that i can add is installation 
procedure,especially disk partitoning. It's a very dungerous/important 
procedure but it's description ins INSTALL.i386 is a bit too short and 
need examples(espcially). Something like - "Imagine we have disk with 
such and such patitions and now we want to install OpenBSD here &amp; there so 
we should... It would'be _very_ helpfull.

BTW, does anybody work on installation software ? Something like in FreeBSD/RedHat ?
