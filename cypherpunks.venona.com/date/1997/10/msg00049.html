&gt;  International Efforts to Combat Money Laundering

&gt;
&gt;   Money Laundering:  A Practical Guide to the New
&gt;Legislation
&gt;     Rowan Bosworth-Davies and Graham Saltmarsh
&gt;           Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 1994,
&gt;             xii and 304pp, 49.50 (hbk)
&gt;                (ISBN 0 412 57530 2)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The first of these books is a collection of treaties, plus other
&gt;documents, concerned with the international fight against
&gt;money laundering.  The second explains how these treaties
&gt;have been enacted into, and are enforced under, the laws of
&gt;the United Kingdom.  Both works will repay the closest
&gt;study.  In clear detail, they show the growth of what must
&gt;be called a New World Order, and how, without some
&gt;interposing cause, this may produce a universal slide into
&gt;despotism.
&gt;
&gt;The fight against money laundering begins with realising
&gt;that the "War on Drugs" has been lost.  When goods are
&gt;portable and easily concealed, and when demand for them is
&gt;strong enough to bear almost any cost of bringing them to
&gt;market, the main effect of prohibition will be to put a
&gt;bounty on crime.  For all the efforts of the past three
&gt;generations, illegal drugs are available in most high security
&gt;prisons.  In much of the West, street prices have been
&gt;stable or even falling since 1980.
&gt;
&gt;The official response, however, has not been to give in and
&gt;legalise the trade, but to expand the War to a front where
&gt;previously there had been few hostilities.  While keeping up
&gt;their efforts against the trade itself, the authorities have
&gt;turned increasingly to confiscating its proceeds.  This new
&gt;approach has three alleged benefits:
&gt;
&gt;First, it will deprive criminals of their incentive to enter
&gt;and remain in the trade;
&gt;
&gt;Second, it will allow the punishing of those in charge of the
&gt;trade - people who never touch or see illegal drugs, but to
&gt;whom the main profits ultimately flow;
&gt;
&gt;Third, it can make the War on Drugs self-supporting, and
&gt;perhaps yield a surplus for other public spending.
&gt;
&gt;There is, however, one practical difficulty.  Before the
&gt;authorities can confiscate the money, they must find it.  To
&gt;do this, they must keep it from being merged beyond recall
&gt;into the general flow of investment.  This involves ending
&gt;bank secrecy and imposing a mass of financial regulation.
&gt;Now, most people - especially the rich - dislike having their
&gt;lives pried into.  Nor do banks like higher costs and
&gt;limitations on what business they can do.  And so, given
&gt;the present freedom of capital markets, no government
&gt;acting alone can afford a strict policy of confiscation.  It
&gt;would, sooner or later, cause a flight of transactions to
&gt;more liberal places.
&gt;
&gt;The solution has been to try making everywhere in the
&gt;world equally illiberal.  Such  was the purpose of the
&gt;United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in
&gt;Narcotic Drugs and Narcotic Substances, signed in Vienna
&gt;in December 1988 [full text in Gilmore, pp.75-97].  This is
&gt;one of the most important international treaties of the past
&gt;50 years.  It not merely requires its signatory states to
&gt;criminalise the laundering of drug money, and to confiscate
&gt;it where found, but lays down so far as possible a common
&gt;wording for the criminal statutes, and a common mode of
&gt;enforcement.  It also requires full and prompt cooperation
&gt;between the signatory states for the enforcement of these
&gt;laws anywhere in the world.
&gt;
&gt;The Convention had little direct or immediate effect on
&gt;British law.  Many of its requirements, indeed, had already
&gt;been met in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986.  Most
&gt;others were only met in the Criminal Justice Act 1993,
&gt;which enacts the European Community Directive of 1991
&gt;on the Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the
&gt;Purpose of Money Laundering [full text in Gilmore,
&gt;pp.250-67].  This itself derives from the Vienna Convention
&gt;only through the Council of Europe Convention on
&gt;Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the
&gt;Proceeds from Crime 1990 [full text in Gilmore, pp.177-
&gt;91].  Even so, this country is fast becoming a financial
&gt;police state of the kind agreed at Vienna - and where the
&gt;process cannot be traced to the Convention, it can be traced
&gt;to the same international pressures of which the Convention
&gt;is itself a result.
&gt;
&gt;Let me explain.  When I talk about a New World Order, I
&gt;do not mean some grand conspiracy of bankers, or Jews, or
&gt;Illuminati, or even - with far more probability - the
&gt;American Government.  There are countries where policy is
&gt;largely dictated from outside.  But for rich and powerful
&gt;countries, the truth is more complex.  Most international
&gt;obligations imposed on this country, for example, were not
&gt;only consented to by our rulers, but were usually proposed
&gt;by them, and are enforced by agencies in which our own
&gt;countrymen often occupy senior positions.
&gt;
&gt;Where others see conspiracies, I see public choice
&gt;economics.  Whenever a government tries to do something
&gt;dangerous or unnecessary, like banning drugs or educating
&gt;the poor, it must set up an agency through which to spend
&gt;the allocated funds.  Once employed, the agents will - as if
&gt;directed by an invisible hand - start to find more and more
&gt;justifications for expanding their status and numbers.  They
&gt;collect the statistics.  They know which ones to publish and
&gt;which to hold back.  They are the politicians' first and
&gt;favoured source of advice.  They have their pet journalists.
&gt;They trade favours with the relevant interest groups.  They
&gt;know exactly how to give themselves a pleasing life, and
&gt;how to see off threats to it.  Unless the money runs out, or
&gt;the public turns really nasty, they can write their own
&gt;budget cheques.
&gt;
&gt;By natural extension, the same is now happening at the
&gt;international level - though with potentially far worse
&gt;consequences.  In the first place, there is limitless money:
&gt;budgets would need to swell unimaginably large to reach
&gt;even one per cent of gross planetary product.  In the
&gt;second, public anger seldom crosses borders; and, if all else
&gt;fails, the politicians and bureaucrats in one country can
&gt;shelter behind the excuse of treaty obligations that cannot be
&gt;unilaterally be cast off - not, at least, without consequences
&gt;more horrible than words exist to describe.  Third, the
&gt;enforcement of international treaties means the growth of
&gt;what is in effect an international bureaucracy.  The local
&gt;enforcers of a treaty may be citizens of the signatory states,
&gt;who will live and work in their home countries, and may
&gt;even occupy positions in the domestic administration.  Yet
&gt;these are people who, by virtue of the agreements they
&gt;enforce, and the contacts they make and maintain in other
&gt;countries, are members of an international order.  And, in
&gt;at least the case of money laundering, they will share an
&gt;agenda that is often deeply hostile to their native
&gt;institutions.
&gt;
&gt;This can be seen - expressed with almost naive honesty - in
&gt;the book by Messrs Bosworth-Davies and Saltmarsh.  Both
&gt;are British police officers:  the latter is a departmental head
&gt;at the National Criminal Intelligence Service.  Both take it
&gt;for granted that the world needs an international police
&gt;force.  Both are unable to believe that anyone can
&gt;disinterestedly object to the necessary harmonisations of
&gt;law, and the corresponding abolition of Common Law
&gt;protections.  They "know one senior clearing banker who
&gt;has described this [money laundering] legislation as the
&gt;nearest thing he has experienced to
&gt;'McCarthyism'...".[p.172]  Of course, they see things
&gt;differently.  The legislation
&gt;
&gt;    discloses, on mature reflection, a set of carefully
&gt;    structured laws which, with good will, due
&gt;    diligence and a modicum of responsible attention
&gt;    from the industry as a whole, should not prove
&gt;    too burdensome.  Indeed, the authors believe that
&gt;    some of the regulatory requirements have been
&gt;    diluted too much already, in a misguided attempt
&gt;    to placate the sensibilities of certain sectors of the
&gt;    industry....[Ibid.]
&gt;
&gt;With people like this advising the politicians and lecturing
&gt;the rest of us, little wonder the Drug Trafficking Offences
&gt;Act predates the Vienna Convention by two years!  Though
&gt;they will hotly disagree - and even perhaps consider a libel
&gt;writ - Messrs Bosworth-Davies and Saltmarsh cannot be
&gt;regarded as our countrymen.  More at home in a gathering
&gt;of Bulgarian or Filipino police chiefs than with any of us,
&gt;they are foreigners with British passports.
&gt;
&gt;Somewhat less honest, though still interesting, is the
&gt;Explanatory Report of the Committee of Experts who
&gt;drafted the Council of Europe Convention [full text in
&gt;Gilmore, pp.192-237].  Though formally subordinate to a
&gt;committee of the various European Ministers of Justice,
&gt;these experts plainly saw their first duty as lying elsewhere.
&gt;Call it "the international community" or their own order,
&gt;their duty was collective and not to any single country.
&gt;
&gt;Look at their dislike of the narrow focus of the Vienna
&gt;Convention.  They wanted something that would also allow
&gt;confiscation for
&gt;
&gt;    terrorist offences, organised crime, violent crimes,
&gt;    offences involving the sexual exploitation of
&gt;    children and young persons, extortion,
&gt;    kidnapping, environmental offences, economic
&gt;    fraud, insider trading and other serious offences.
&gt;    [Gilmore, p.204]
&gt;
&gt;But they had to concede that not every European country
&gt;might like its own laws against these acts to be written by
&gt;an international committee.  And so they allowed each
&gt;signatory state to reserve whatever of these acts to its own
&gt;legislative process.
&gt;
&gt;    The experts agreed, however, that such states
&gt;    should review their legislation periodically and
&gt;    expand the applicability of confiscation measures,
&gt;    in order to be able to restrict the reservations
&gt;    subsequently as much as possible. [Ibid.]
&gt;
&gt;And this is only the beginning.  As yet, the shape of world
&gt;government exists barely in outline.  But the tendency ought
&gt;to be plain.  Power is moving from national - and mostly
&gt;democratic - governments to unaccountable and even
&gt;invisible bureaucracies.  Liberal institutions that are often
&gt;the work of ages are being hammered into the transmitters
&gt;of unlimited power.  We are beginning to known how
&gt;people in the Greek city states felt after absorption into the
&gt;Roman Empire.
&gt;
&gt;When the American militiamen cry out that the United
&gt;Nations is about to invade in black helicopters and plant
&gt;microcomputers in their bottoms, I am at least sceptical.
&gt;This is not the New World Order that I see.  What I do see
&gt;is actually worse.  We can shoot the helicopters down, and
&gt;dig out the microcomputers, and put the ringleaders on
&gt;trial.  We can go about playing the hero of our choice from
&gt;Star Wars.  But in the real world, there is no Death Star to
&gt;blow up - no Darth Vadar to push into the void.  There is
&gt;just a huge, elastic network of people, all acting in what
&gt;they believe is the public good, most with some degree of
&gt;public support.
&gt;
&gt;How this kind of despotism can be resisted is another
&gt;question, and I have said enough already.  But I will repeat
&gt;- the books here reviewed do repay a very close study.  At
&gt;the very least, it is useful to see the enemy's future plan
&gt;laid out in such detail.
