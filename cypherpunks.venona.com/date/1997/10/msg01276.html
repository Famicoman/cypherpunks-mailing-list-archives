&gt;                  FBI SAYS SAN FRANCISCO BLACKOUT WAS SABOTAGE
&gt;                                        
&gt;      Blackout October 24, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 10:10 p.m. EDT (0210 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Utility officials increased security at power
&gt;      stations around San Francisco on Friday after FBI investigators said
&gt;      someone intentionally cut power to the city's downtown.
&gt;      
&gt;      "It was a deliberate act," said FBI spokesman George Grotz. "It was
&gt;      not an accident, and it was not a computer intrusion."
&gt;      
&gt;      Robert Glynn Jr., president and chief executive officer of Pacific
&gt;      Gas &amp; Electric Co, declined to comment on whether authorities
&gt;      believe it was an inside job.
&gt;      
&gt;      Grotz said there was no sign of forced entry into the locked city
&gt;      substation, and agents are looking at records of about 75 employees
&gt;      who had access to the building. Sabotage of an electrical facility
&gt;      is a federal offense.
&gt;      
&gt;      FBI agents examined the switches and dusted the equipment for
&gt;      fingerprints, Grotz said.
&gt;      
&gt;      The switches in the substation were toggled in such a way as to
&gt;      maximize the power outage. The saboteur had cut power coming into
&gt;      and out of the station, Grotz said.
&gt;      
&gt;      The effect was that a bank of transformers failed around 6:15 a.m.
&gt;      Thursday, blacking out electricity to 126,000 customers -- about
&gt;      250,000 people -- in a five-mile, mid-city stretch from the Marina
&gt;      to the Sunset districts for 90 minutes or more.
&gt;      
&gt;      The blackout stopped elevators and alarm clocks, knocked out traffic
&gt;      signals and left commuters shouting and honking their horns in
&gt;      frustration.
&gt;      
&gt;      Police spokesman Sherman Ackerson said the department held over its
&gt;      midnight shift and put 450 police and parking patrol officers on the
&gt;      streets to ease traffic headaches.
&gt;      
&gt;      Entire neighborhoods lacked public transit because much of the
&gt;      city's bus system runs on electricity. Bay Area Rapid Transit trains
&gt;      kept running, but two stations went dark and briefly closed.
&gt;      
&gt;      The city was back to normal Friday morning, with traffic and
&gt;      omnipresent coffee machines humming as usual -- a far cry from
&gt;      Thursday's chaos, said Joshua Larsen of the Coffee Roastery, a
&gt;      bean's throw from San Francisco's famous Powell Street cable car
&gt;      turnaround.
&gt;      
&gt;      He had just arrived for work and was preparing the morning coffee
&gt;      when everything stopped.
&gt;      
&gt;      "Right in the middle of grinding coffee -- it was a blend of Kenya
&gt;      and French roast -- the power stopped cold," Larsen said.
