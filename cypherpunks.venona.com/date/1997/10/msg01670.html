&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;CBS news tonight showed cops in a northern CA town use swabs to apply
&gt; &gt;"pepper spray" directly to the eyes of demonstrators in some Congressman's
&gt; &gt;office. One cop administered headlocks, another pried eyelids open and a
&gt; &gt;third administered discipline.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That's the ticket. Skip the judge and jury, just let the
&gt; &gt;cops torture the perps.  Why stop at pepper spray?  Why not bamboo shoots?
&gt; &gt;Electric shocks to the genitals?  We must have order.

&gt; On the other hand, the perps were trespaassers in private offices. Me, I
&gt; would've been inclined to fire up my Stihl and separate their little fairy
&gt; circle at their wrists.

  The manufacturer of the pepper spray used warns that it should be
used from a minimum of three feet away, as closer use will result
in tissue damage.
  Videos show the police spraying it directly in the non-violent
demonstrators eyes from inches away.
  Naturally, even if they shot the non-violent demonstrators in
the eye from inches away, with their guns, they would be provided
with a taxpayer-supported legal team to claim that the officers 
were in fear for their lives from seated, handcuffed, unarmed,
non-violent demonstrators.

  If I trespass on Tim's property, I would fully expect him to
deal with me in a manner consistent with his declared intentions.
I would expect the same from those who claim to be bound by the
same rule of law that they _force_ on the citizens.
  This non-violent demonstrators were willing to accept the agreed
upon punishment/cost of their actions in protest of the actions
of their public servants. Their public servants, as usual, chose
to to act in the manner of savages who are incapable of holding
to the rule of law which they use to justify their confiscation
of the citizen's right to bear arms in the face of tyranny.

  Twenty years or so ago, after seeing pictures of mothers and
children in chains at a Livermore Labs protest, I wrote a song
called "Don't Blame Me, I Voted For The Monkey."
  If more people had followed my example, we would be singing 
the praises of government, as Bozo sits in the Oval Office
typing new legislation which would likely be far superior to
anything we have seen in the last twenty years.
