           REPORT: PARENTS SOUGHT TREATMENT FOR TEEN SLAYING SUSPECT
                                       
     The suspect's house October 3, 1997
     Web posted at: 4:18 a.m. EDT (0818 GMT)
     
     JACKSON TOWNSHIP, New Jersey (AP) -- Three days before 11-year-old
     Eddie Werner vanished while selling candy door-to-door, the parents
     of the teen accused of killing him reportedly asked a judge to lock
     up their son.
     
     The parents of the teen asked a Family Court judge on September 24
     to place him in a residential psychiatric treatment center in a bid
     to get his violent behavior under control, The Star-Ledger of Newark
     reported Friday.
     
     Instead, he was allowed to remain at home. Werner
     
     Last Saturday, Werner disappeared as he sold candy and wrapping
     paper for a school fund-raiser. His body was discovered Monday night
     in a wooded area between the neighborhoods where he and the suspect
     lived.
     
     Authorities have not released the name of the suspect because he is
     under 18.
     
     On Thursday, prosecutors said they believe the suspect was molested
     by a 43-year-old New York man who met him through an online chat
     room and arranged trysts.
     
     Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said Stephen Simmons, 43, of
     Holbrook, New York, and the suspect met at New Jersey motels and at
     Simmons' home for sex several times over the past 13 months. Simmons
     
     
     The boy's parents learned of the meetings and informed police.
     Simmons, who has been charged with third-degree sodomy and could
     face other charges, was arrested on September 24 -- the same day the
     suspect's parents made their request of the judge.
     
     "These people had been crying out for help a week before the
     incident," the suspect's attorney, Michael Critchley, told The
     Star-Ledger. "Everybody should step back and pause a moment before
     they put this kid on a pyre and burn him."
     
     The teen-age suspect faces murder, aggravated sexual assault and
     robbery charges. Prosecutors were reviewing whether to have him
     tried as an adult. memorial
     
     Acquaintances described the suspect as a loner and a bully, but
     others said he was an average teen and a good student with an
     interest in computers. He built his own Web page, which he filled
     with biographical tidbits and exhaustive information about his
     favorite rock band, Smashing Pumpkins.
     
     He also explored other regions of the online world. Kaye said
     information found on a computer drive seized by prosecutors
     indicated the boy was visiting homosexual chat rooms, where he first
     met Simmons.
