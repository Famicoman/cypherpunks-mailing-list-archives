* Secretary William S. Cohen says. 
*                          
* The nation's defense chief told the Army Times he once considered the
* chilling specter of armored vehicles  surrounding civilian hotels or
* government buildings to block out terrorists as strictly an overseas
* phenomenon. But no longer. 
*                          
* It could happen here, Cohen said he concluded after eight months of studying
* threats under the Pentagon microscope. 
*                          
* Free-lance terrorists with access to deadly chemical and biological bombs
* are "going to change the way in which the American people view security in
* our own country, he predicted in a Sept. 10 interview. 
*                          
* Cohen is calling for the government to step up its efforts to penetrate
* wildcard terrorist organizations. 
*                          
* "It's going to require greater intelligence on our part - much greater
* emphasis on intelligence gathering capability, more human intelligence, and
* it's going to take more technical intelligence," he said. 
*                          
* But using the U.S. military in a domestic law enforcement role would require
* revisions to laws in force for more than a century, cautions Shreveport
* attorney John Odom Jr. "You can't do it from the the Defense Department side
* unless Congress dramatically revises the Posse Comitatus laws," said Odom, a
* colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and a reserve judge advocate. 
*                          
* The 1878 law specifically prohibits the use of the military in domestic law
* enforce- ment unless authorized by Congress or the Constitution and does not
* allow for military intervention through action by the secretary of defense
* or even an executive order from the president, Odom said. 
*                          
* "We're trained from the first day of judge advocate school to think of Posse
* Comitatus !! Odom said. "If Secretary Cohen is suggesting that the
* Department of Defense be involved, it may be part of a legislative package.
* But it will not happen unilaterally without a lot of folks thinking long and
* hard about it." 
*                          
* Cohen said terrorism would be a top priority in five new areas he plans to
* focus on now that he has wrapped up his first defense budget, the
* quadrennial review of the military and a new, four-year defense strategy. 
*                          
* Other goals include modernizing the military, improving troops housing and
* other benefits, streamlining the defense bureaucracy and shaping new
* military relationships and contacts across the globe.
