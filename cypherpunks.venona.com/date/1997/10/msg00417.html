New Power-line Telephone Technology Set To Hit UK

LONDON - Electricity companies may become the latest providers of telephone
and Internet services to your home.

Forget separate lines from telephone or cable companies: you might talk and
send computer data at high speed via existing power cables -- the same lines
that supply electricity to your washing machine and fridge.

The electricity lines have been able to carry telephone signals and computer
data for some time but not in a commercially viable way because they were
too slow.

Britain's Norweb Communications, part of United Utilities, and Canada's
Northern Telecom, however, appear to have developed a new technology to
speed things up considerably.

"The technology has been successfully tested, is ready for the mass market,
has the potential to stimulate major growth in Internet use, and will change
the future for electricity utilities," the firms said in a statement.

They will announce details at a news conference on Wednesday, but media
reports here said the new technology allows computer data to be whizzed
around at more than 10 times the speed of current average Internet modems.

&gt; &gt; I heard on the ABC hourly news that some genius had figured out a way
&gt; &gt; to use electrical power lines for data transmission, so that the power
&gt; &gt; grid could be integrated into the Internet.  Does anyone have any
&gt; &gt; details / pointers?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jonathan Wienke
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard of two methods; one is to transmit the data as a high
&gt; frequency FM signal along the wire. The other is to use power lines
&gt; which include an optical fibre. 
&gt; 
&gt; Both have problems. 
&gt; 
&gt; The FM signal has difficulty going through transformers (there are 
&gt; lots of transformers, with the final step-down usually occuring at 
&gt; a pole-top near your house). Also, you have to be very careful about
&gt; isolating the data output from the power line: an error could send
&gt; 110VAC into your serial board. I haven't heard of this method being
&gt; used on a wide scale, but it might work as a LAN.
&gt; 
&gt; The optical method may actually be implemented. Putting a few optical
&gt; fibers into a power line is cheap, easy, and widely done. The
&gt; idea was originally that power companies could read your electrical meter 
&gt; remotely, but the bandwidth available is gross overkill. Thus they 
&gt; are also thinking of adding Cable TV, telephony, and data services.
&gt; 
&gt; There are still problems. You are basically building a data network 
&gt; on top of the power grid, and the topologies don't really match up.
&gt; Also, employees have to be trained to splice optical fibers and
&gt; install routing equipment, and millions of miles of power lines and
&gt; hundreds of millions of junctions need to be replaced or reworked.
&gt; 
&gt; There was a rosy article about this in Wired a few years ago. I have
&gt; heard nothing since.
