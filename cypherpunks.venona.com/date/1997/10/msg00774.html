&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately I wasn't on cypherpunks-unedited at the time, but I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thought that it was immediate send out from toad.com without going via
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sandy.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Going over my notes I see that at least one of my submissions - the
&gt; &gt;&gt; one quoting the C2Net lawyer letter in its entirety - didn't appear
&gt; &gt;&gt; even on cypherpunks-unedited.
&gt; &gt;

Just where was the Lawyer's letter?  Did it have any telephone number
on it?  I want to call that guy and make sure it was really from him.

&gt; &gt;I think I saw this claim made before around the time of the "moderation
&gt; &gt;experiment".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The only ways I can see that this could have happened are either that:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  i)  John Gilmore started editing cypherpunks-unedited at Sandy/C2net's
&gt; &gt;      request
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  ii) cypherpunks-unedited was edited all along by someone (John or Sandy)
&gt; &gt;

Are John and Sandy still sucking and fucking each other?

&gt; &gt;i) is sort of feasible, perhaps there are others who were on unedited
&gt; &gt;and were counting who could confirm this.  Toto I think was.
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently a 'bot was installed on toad.com to discard my submissions from the
&gt; "unedited" list _after my article which prompted the C2net threatening lawyer
&gt; letter did make it through the "unedited" list (but was censored from the
&gt; "flames" list by C2Net).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;ii) is hard to believe because the fact that something is edited shows
&gt; &gt;-- when the editor is sleeping you get lag.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm fairly sure I didn't see the C2 legal letter you posted yesterday
&gt; &gt;before.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry to have to return to this topic that's been beaten to death and
&gt; causes me intense nausea. I figured I'll comment on two more attempts to
&gt; revise history by lying C2Net shills from Hewlett Packard and Oracle.
&gt; 
&gt; Please recall that C2Net created 3 lists on toad.com:
&gt;  unedited
&gt;  flames
&gt;  C2Net-approved
&gt; 
&gt; At one point, all my submissions to cypherpunks appeared on "unedited" and
&gt; then on "flames" with about a 3-second delay, indicating a 'bot at work. The
&gt; 'bot was scrubbed when C2net decided that my writings were not suitable for
&gt; auto- forwarding to the "flames" list either. For about a week, numerous
&gt; articles by myself, Tim May, et al appeared on "unedited" but not on "flames".
&gt; 
&gt; Howver toward the end of the "moderation experiment" apparently a 'bot on
&gt; toad.com was filtering my submissions from the 'unedited' list as well. My Jan
&gt; 30th announcement that C2Net filtered out of the flames list _did show up on
&gt; the unedited list. However my following articles, like the one quoting C2Net's
&gt; threatening lawyer letter (which I cc'd to numerous people, including JYA,
&gt; who, not surprisingly, declined to put it on his archive) did _not appear on
&gt; the "unedited" list. Nevertheless at least one lying C2Net shill from Hewlett
&gt; Packard claims that my articles appearing on the unedited list on January 30th
&gt; prove that I wasn't being filtered from "unedited" one week later.
&gt; 
&gt; Another lying C2net shill, Jason E. Durbin, a technical writer for Oracle,
&gt; just wrote in news.admin.net-abuse.policy:
&gt; 
&gt; }For those unfamiliar with the tactics Vulis uses when attempting to
&gt; }destroy moderated fora, take a look at the current, ongoing thread
&gt; }called "Stronghold" (and other variations on same) on the Cypherpunks
&gt; }mailing list archived at:
&gt; }
&gt; }<A  HREF="http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/current/date.html#start">http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/current/date.html#start</A>
&gt; }
&gt; }It summarizes (including Vulis' take on the situation) Vulis' attack
&gt; }on the mailing list itself via a feigned attack on the Stronghold
&gt; }security server.
&gt; }
&gt; }In summary, make such an annoyance of yourself by whatever means
&gt; }necessary (posting binaries, running an insultbot, making false
&gt; }accusations, etc.) to get yourself threatened with banishment, then
&gt; }rally the free speech advocates by painting yourself as the innocent
&gt; }harmed party even though no banishment occurred.
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; }
&gt; }Interesting insights into how Vulis attempts to manipulate his victims
&gt; }into damning themselves while making him look like a victim.
&gt; }Interesting reading.
&gt; 
&gt; "No banishment occured" - more bizarre lies from C2Net and their supporters.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and I don't recall sending binaries to this list either.
&gt; 
&gt; This reminds me of the claim by Rich Graves, another C2Net/Cygnus shill, that
&gt; I'm sending "hundreds" of articles a day to this mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; You may recall that the same C2net/Oracle shill Jason Durbin has been
&gt; following up on my Usenet articles in sci.crypt, comp.unix.questions, etc
&gt; with lies and libel: claiming, e.g., that I "lie about my credentials",
&gt; that I don't even have a master's degree, etc. Is C2Net paying Jason Durbin
&gt; to badmouth my academic credentials?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From Jason Durbin's Net.Scum page:
&gt; 
&gt; Jason E. Durbin, jdurbin@nl.oracle.com, jed@poisson.com,
&gt; slothrop@poisson.com, jed@best.com, jed@netcom.com.
&gt; 
&gt; Jason claims to work for Poisson Corporation, 8 Avocet Drive, #211, Redwood
&gt; Shores, CA 94065, tel +1 415 637 0435, JD503.
&gt; 
&gt; In real life, Jason is a lowly technical writer for Oracle Corporation, 500
&gt; Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065, tel: +1 800 345 3267, +1 415 506 7000,
&gt; (+1 605 506 7000), fax: +1 415 506 7200.
&gt; 
&gt; Jason's manager in the technical writing department is:
&gt; Sanford Dreskin
&gt; Mail Stop:  MS-40P12
&gt; Office tel: +1 415 506 2181
&gt; Office fax: +1 415 506 7228
&gt; Home tel: +1 510 376 9526
&gt; Home addr: 859 Augusta Drive, Moraga, CA 94556-1051
&gt; 
&gt; In what ways are Durbin and the Hewlett-Packard liar affiliated with C2Net?
&gt; 

Yes, this c2Net needs investigated as a troublemaker.
