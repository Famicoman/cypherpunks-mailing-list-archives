&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do they actually mention PGP software, or OpenPGP standard?  Or just
&gt; &gt; the general principle?
&gt; 
&gt; They do: the title is "Le programme PGP se range", which I unfortunatly
&gt; have know idea of how to translate. And then, they say (I loosely
&gt; translate, my english is better than our MISTY friend's, but not perfect
&gt; ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; [translation of discussion of pgp5.5]
&gt;
&gt; So, I certainly agree with you that the proGAK have won, or will. As
&gt; long as they don't enforce the current laws, as an individual I don't
&gt; care. But I fear, as you do, that as soon as you have things like pgp
&gt; 5.5 which are available, they will start saying "use this or go to jail".

There is a precedent for this of sorts in France.  You probably recall
that prior to the netscape 40 bit breaks, there were 3 versions of
netscape:

- 128 bit US only non-exportable
- 40 bit exportable
- no SSL at all -- French version

After Damien Doligez hit the headlines with his first break of 40 bit
SSL, and the other breaks had similar headlines, the French
authorities noticed -- "oh," they thought, "if those cypherpunks can
break it, so can DGSE" -- I understood that from that point on they
allowed 40 bit SSL netscape browsers in France.  (At least someone
reported about this on list).  That Damien himself is French and was
working at a researcher at INRIA(?) of all places only adds to the
irony.  (That Damien had a his PGP key at the bottom of his web page
which must have attracted 100,000s of hits after that also is somewhat
amusing, illegal PGP usage, and no one said a word).

Anyway, my perhaps rude jibe to Jonathan Seybold, PGP Inc's chairman a
few days back that PGP should "make a sales pitch to French DGSE" was
not so far off after all.

Course there is still the export problem.  Perhaps eventually the NSA
and DGSE/SCSSI, CESG/GCHQ will come to some kind of reciprocal
agreement, and then there will be another export exemption in the US
following on from the 56 bit DES exemption for companies which can
demonstrate they are working to a 2 year schedule to have key escrow
built in.

Or perhaps some european competitor will provide pgp5.5 compatible
software to them (with support for multiple CMR keys, something not
yet in pgp5.5, but already accepted without problem, and planned I
gather for the next major release).

&gt; &gt; But, the simple fact is that I think PGP Inc have not evaluated these
&gt; &gt; indirect implications for GAK politics.  This means I think that they
&gt; &gt; have pure intentions.  Unfortunately these pure intentions do not help
&gt; &gt; us if the effect is as I fear: that the result helps the GAKkers to
&gt; &gt; some significant amount.
&gt; 
&gt; I think, but I might be wrong, that they have at least to reasons, which
&gt; have already be given:
&gt; -first, what they did was somehow "easy" (don't jump on me, I don't
&gt; write code !!) to implement within the existing code. This is reflected
&gt; by what W.Geiger said, that anything pgp5.5 does he could do with
&gt; scripts in the old version. Or at least a good part of it.

This is true, it could be done largely with multiple recipient feature
in 2.x.  Bill Stewart and William Geiger and I think PGP's Jon Callas
pointed this out.

However I think that:

a) this is no excuse to actually _implement_ it!

b) PGP implementing this kind of thing encourages others to do so
also as they could become the defacto standards setter (particularly
with this almost certainly going in OpenPGP standard, and PGP defining
the semantics of the CMR either in or outside the standard to be what
they have done in pgp5.5)

c) it sets out the design work for other companies less scrupulous
companies such as TIS, etc. to interoperate marginally more smoothly
with pgp installed base when they implement something even worse
compatible with OpenPGP.

d) the alternative I proposed, or especially Tims alternative are even
simpler if anything to implement

&gt; -second, they don't know what will happen in 12 months, so they cover
&gt; their asses. I hope this isn't true, but it's a matter of personnal
&gt; opinion more than anything else.

Monty Cantsin said this.  I said similar things also, and got shouted
out by PGP Inc people for being rude.

I don't think so, I hope not anyway.

&gt; As I said before, I guess they did it this way by lazyness more than
&gt; anything else. I think your solution requires more thinking, new code,
&gt; and all that sort of things. More brain demanding, in some sense (and
&gt; time consuming, whereas their solution is ready, works, can be sold,
&gt; makes the compagny make profits, and so on). 

It seems somewhat fair enough if it was much more difficult to do that
this might be difficult to acheive within their budget and user
delivery date demands, etc.

But, Tim's proposal to store in clear seems easy enough.

My alternative on top of that is merely to encrypt the mail folder
with pgp -c; they've got all the technology sitting there.  It is only
a simple scripting task.  If I was William Geiger I would say that you
could knock that up over the week end in a few scripts.  I expect I
could too :-) (eg. if I knew emacs elisp, I reckon it would be easy
enough to decrypt the mailbox prior to use, and re-encrypt after use.
Or to do the same on a per message basis after decryption, or for all
messages encrypted or not.  Perhaps I'll have a go at getting Pat
Lopresti to add this for mailcrypt.el v3.5).

The task isn't any harder for them.

It is not a technical objection, or at least I have seen no technical
objections so far.

I think it is purely a privacy objection: they have worked out some
privacy preserving principles, and to enforce them they have come up
with this approach.  The message snooping dangers seem to have been
overlooked, or considered unavoidable trade-offs to achieve their
privacy objectives.  They are simply wrong in this regard.

&gt; So, arguing with political
&gt; arguments doesn't stand a chance against a market driven compagny, be it
&gt; PGP with all its reputation capital. Everybody should concentrate on
&gt; technical issues, and several of these have been pointed out, by you and
&gt; others.

Political arguments stand a better chance with PGP Inc than with most
any other company ... but of course there are limits.

&gt; This is, of course, purely a storage issue. And I like the idea (Bill
&gt; Stewart's ?) of implementing a mechanism which would simply "weaken" the
&gt; storage key, so that if it's lost, you can recover the missing part by
&gt; brute force. 

I think Bill's point was more that you would make recovery harder.
That is you have two ways into the messages: your passphrase, and some
recovery information (a second copy of your private key).  He
suggested that you miss off some bits, to discourage companies from
abusing what was meant to be a disaster recovery system being used as
a storage recovery system.
