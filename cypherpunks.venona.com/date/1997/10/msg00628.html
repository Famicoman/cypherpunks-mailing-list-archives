 ZOG Advances Control over Information with Clinton's Executive Order 13010
                          for "Information Warfare"

        by Michael A. Hoffman II Copyright©1997. All Rights Reserved

Excerpt: "Managing the new risks inherent in an information-based society
requires a different type of information exchange within the industry and
between industry and government...Key to its success will be protecting the
privileged information from both government and the private sector from
unauthorized disclosure."

      -- Robert T. Marsh, Chairman, President's Commission on Critical
                          Infrastructure Protection

The Zionist Occupation Government (ZOG) further advanced Communist-like
controls over American infrastructure, and underscored the cooperation
between the Communist and Capitalist mentalities, when U.S. President Bill
Clinton, with virutally no scrutiny from the Establishment news media,
signed totalitarian Executive Order 13010 last July (1997).

This Order established a new wing of the secret, banker-controlled
government of the United States. While Clinton's Executive Order itself is
written in the lingo of the bureaucrat and hence is largely insipid, its
"fruits" are not.

Executive Order 13010 is concerned with cyberspace "threats" to the power
structure; with computer hackers who have the ability to interefere with
government, business and industry operations. Well, that's the cover story
anyway. In practice, the Executive Order authorizes a commission of bankers,
industrialists and secret policemen (and police women) to gather
intelligence on dissidents, government critics and anyone who is a potential
threat to the continuing hegemony of the Aryan-Zionist ruling class.

Here is a portion of the remarks delivered at a meeting (chaired by Janet
"The Witch of Waco" Reno), by Robert T. Marsh, Chairman, President's
Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, at the Bankers Roundtable,
Washington, DC on September 11, 1997:

"One of our toughest problems -- across all infrastructures -- is the
sharing of information. There is already a heavy volume of information
passed by industry -- especially banks, as you well know -- to government as
part of the regulatory process and through law enforcement.

"Managing the new risks inherent in an information-based society requires a
different type of information exchange within the industry and between
industry and government. Furthermore, managing these new risks calls for
partnership at many different levels, from policy-making aimed at preventing
a crisis to responding if such a crisis occurs. The Commission has some
specific proposals in this regard:

"We will recommend the establishment of an Information Sharing, Analysis,
and Warning "Organization" -- a public-private organization that embodies
the trust essential for the partnership between government and the
owners/operators for successful infrastructure assurance.

"We envision an 'information clearinghouse' staffed by up-and-comers from
both government and industry who will receive relevant information from all
sources -- public and private, anonymous or attributable -- analyze this
information to assess what is happening in the infrastructures, decide on
the necessary protective measures to be taken, then disseminate needed
information to both government and the private sector. Key to its success
will be protecting the privileged information from both government and the
private sector from unauthorized disclosure.

"Would you be willing to take turns providing a talented young banker from
your company to represent the banking and finance sector inside such an
organization?

"Enhance industry's information sharing capability by creating Sector
Information Assurance Coordinators that best suit each infrastructure's
information-sharing needs -- either through an existing association or by
creating a new entity. In essence, we are proposing that each industry
designate a representative to be the channel for exchanging information with
the government. Your reaction?

"Create a National Infrastructure Assurance Council -- a very high level
council comprised of senior CEOs from throughout the critical
infrastructures, meeting regularly with selected Cabinet Officers...

"These recommendations lay the foundation for the 'trusted environment' to
achieving the public-private partnership essential for protection into the
next century."

What we are seeing here is the establishment of a thought police agency
within the Federal government with links to law enforcement, concealed under
weasel words such as "Information Clearinghouse" and "Sector Information
Assurance." This recalls the Pentagon term for the slaughter of Iraqi
civilians by the U.S. Air Force-- "collateral damage."

Dr. Goebbels at least had the relative honesty to call his agency the
Ministry of Propaganda. The Zionist Occupation Government refers to their
propaganda and secret police functions with the bland title of "National
Information Assurance Council." They're not propagandists, they're "Sector
Information Assurance Coordinators."

Mr. Marsh's reference to the gathering of "anonymous" information is of
interest. Here is the keystone of all totalitarian powers--the anonymous
snitch who turns in the hated old lady next door as a witch only because he
can do so without attribution. Our Anglo-Saxon Common Law requires two
witnesses and the U.S. Constitution insures the right to face one's
accusers, but ZOG is operating on other principles. Chairman Marsh:

"The objective is to achieve voluntary participation of all players within
each infrastructure and to assemble and exchange information without fear of
attribution to specific sources."

That is the chairman of a government commission speaking. This is not
conspiracy theory. These remarks are on the record. They constitute the
Revelation of the Method (cf. my book, "Secret Societies and Psychological
Warfare").

The System is becoming increasingly vulnerable, especially the banking
system which is the biggest con-game of all, since it is based entirely on
the confidence of the public in a commodity which in itself has zero
value--paper notes referred to as "money." Wealth is created and dynastic
families within the Aryan-Zionist ruling class are maintained, by the
circulation or withdrawal of worthless Federal Reserve paper to which the
public is taught to attribute value.

In a similar fashion, the worthless mandates and orders of the Federal
government, promoting a gigantic military-industrial complex in the service
of War-Zionism and the Novus Odo Seclorum of Satan, sodomy and aborticide,
are advanced almost entirely through the value of the fear and awe the
public is taught to have for the Federal government.

As both our funny-money and our funny-government become more and more
obviously worthless in the eyes of even some of the masses of goyim, the
confidence game can no longer be manintained on the basis of psychological
warfare principles alone. The risk factor inherent in the System's "Truth or
Consequences" gambit (discussed at length in my book) has reached the point
where the risk must be "managed" by the function of cyber police.

This is what Clinton's Executive Order 13010 establishes-- a gigiantic
listening post for the secret police through the auspices of business and
industry. Banks having been informing on their customers for years--since
the administration of Ronald ("Super Patriot") Reagan who rubber-stamped the
most onerous bank-reporting rules in our nation's history. Chairman Marsh
admits this:

"There is already a heavy volume of information passed by industry --
especially banks, as you well know--to government as part of the regulatory
process and through law enforcement."

Now the "turn in your neighbor" ethic of the banks is being mandated for all
levels of U.S. commerce through the recruitment, in Mr. Marsh's words, of
"elite CEOS."

The whole point is to shore up flagging confidence in the Federal
government's con-game, as Marsh admits:

"Both the financial service industry and government require strong public
confidence -- the industry in order to derive growth, and the government in
order to derive political viability. Each is central to the daily lives of
virtually every American, and the degree of trust the public is willing to
place in them depends directly on the reliability of the services provided.
Infrastructure, as the carrier of the communications and transactions which
deliver those services, is, therefore, critical to the performance of both.
With the retention of public confidence as a common bond, how might the
industry and government better cooperate to assure that critical financial
services are secured in the information age?"

The chairman of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection is saying that bankers have an interest in deceiving the people
just as government has. The bankers' interest is in continuing to reap
profits and the government's interest is to maintain itself in power against
populist opposition forces.

Chariman Marsh says that the public will only continue to be deceived
("trust"), if the shylocks can keep the game running smoothly. Of course,
that's quite a hat trick in view of the fact that the public is becoming
increasingly aware that the objective of ZOG's game is their own
enslavement. The focus of ZOG in this regard is the "information age."

ZOG's desire is to redouble their spying on us and to further
institutionalize that spying at all sectors of business and commerce and
then link it to the secret police ("law enforcement") for various sorts of
economic, political and career reprisals and penal sanctions.

Here is Mr. Marsh, this time in a speech to the New York Federal Reserve
bankers, September 24, 1997 on what they fear most:

"But, as you well know, major trends of change -- globalization, industry
restructuring, Internet banking, and cyber cash --combine to create new
risks. This is true within the financial services industry as well as the
telecommunications and electric power industries upon which financial
services heavily depend...it is the vulnerability to a possible coordinated
attack on physical operations centers, or on the complex 'system of systems'
which enables this industry to function world-wide, that is of rising
concern."

Marsh before a meeting of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, Sept. 20, 1997, speaking about "illegal" government activity in
connection with "information warfare":

"Let me talk briefly about a recent Joint Staff exercise with which some of
you are probably familiar. This was just one in a series of no-notice
exercises, but this one focused specifically on information warfare. Some of
the issues raised were quite troubling -- including the fact that the Joint
Staff ended up fighting this war, which was not only bad but illegal. They
include many of the questions that the Commission has been grappling with
for the past year: Who should take the lead in responding to a cyber attack
on the United States? Should there be a Commander In Chief for information
warfare? Where are the borders in the cyber age? What are the jurisdictions?
Is this a law enforcement or a defense problem?"

Chairman Robert Marsh's ties are to the military-industrial complex. He is
the former CEO of Morton-Thiokol Corporation, a notorious polluter and
builder of components for nuclear warhead-laden missiles. Mr. Marsh
currently is a trustee of the MITRE Corporation.

According to investigative reporter Stephen Knight in his book, "Jack the
Ripper: The Final Solution," London's Mitre Square was a dumping ground for
the Ripper's victims. Knight states: "Mitre Square has strong Masonic
significance. In fact it is fair to say it was the most Masonic of all
places in London, except for the Great Hall of the Grand Lodge itself."
(London: Grafton Books, 1977, p. 175). I am not here implying that Mr. Marsh
is necessarily a murderer or in league with Jack the Ripper, only that his
relationship with the Mitre name is a synchronicity worth noting. (For the
significance of "synchronicity" to the ruling class cf. the predictive
modeling of the commodities markets and the "catastrophe theory" studies of
Prof. Christopher Zeeman of Warwick University).

Stephen D. Mitchell of the US Justice Dept. is a member of the Marsh
commission. Here he discusses the "insider threat"--the fear the government
has of patriots and dissidents being hired in "critical infastructure" areas
such as banks and of how to screen these "insiders" out of employment. He
also expresses the government's frustration with state privacy laws:

"Privacy is trickier. Our outreach revealed a degree of frustration among
infrastructure owners and operators, some of whom wanted to take greater
employee security precautions than some laws might otherwise allow....The
importance of individual privacy has made obtaining background information
on a potential or current employee a fertile area for strong state laws.
Though grounded in best intentions, this has resulted in unpredictable
disparities of approaches across state lines. The bottom line: a critical
infrastructure owner and operator may in some instances be discouraged if
not prevented from asking many of the types of questions that could help
identify and prevent a growing insider threat to our infrastructures."
--Department of Defense, Worldwide Anti-Terrorism Conference, Aug. 21, 1997.
