&gt;If we as individuals can't make our own decisions about what is best for us,

Indeed. Yet in a democracy, any two other members are assumed to know
better than me, and any 51% to know better than the other 49%.

&gt;Every form of government other than democracy assumes a
&gt;priori that noble oblige is prima facia. To paraphrase an old questions of
&gt;politics, who governs the governors? Or do you feel we have found angels in
&gt;the form of kings?

Democracy is merely the scoundrel's last attempt to maintain the divine
right of kings by coverting it into the divine right of the elected. 

&gt;Which means we should have the lowest number of incarcerated individuals
&gt;instead of the most.

Indeed, thereby proving that democracy *doesn't* work.

&gt;Doesn't work what way?

Midnight raids, anti-drug laws, all the examples you just gave of the
evils of democracy, etc, etc.

&gt;Consider, other than democracy, that every form of
&gt;government has an implicit assumption that there is some base sets of
&gt;activities that citizens should be permitted and they will be happy.

Someone (Churchill?) once said that democracy is the best form of
goverment. Amusingly he considered this a defence of democracy, not
a damning indictment of the entire concept of government.

&gt;In a
&gt;democracy the people are given the opportunity to make up their mind what to
&gt;do with their lives and property without having to obtain permission from
&gt;some authority.

Medical licensing, drivers licenses, pilots licenses, export restrictions,
gun licenses (in various democracies), concealed weapons permits... do I
have to go on? This doesn't seem to bear any resemblance to the reality
of democracy.

&gt;Paying a government to keep the park clean and mowed and the lights on at
&gt;night or my streets well paved and de-iced in winter 

And a government does this better than a private corporation because?

&gt;is not quite the same
&gt;thing as having black-suited ninja wann-be's kicking my door in at 2AM
&gt;because I choose to smoke a joint or even grow my own weed; 

Again, this is a clear example of the failure of democracy. A big
difference between democracy and anarcho-capitalism[1] is that in
an anarcho-capitalist society the cops will be too busy making money
to launch such raids on their customers, and most customers will be
too self-interested to pay cops to raid their neighbors.

&gt;There is a reason behind the madness of "Congress shall make no law...".

Indeed; such a shame they put all those other words into the 
Constitution. That phrase sounds like a pretty good conception
of government to me.
