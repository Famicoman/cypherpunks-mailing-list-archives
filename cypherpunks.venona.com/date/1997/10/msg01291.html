&gt;             COMPUSERVE SETS ITS SIGHTS ON CORPORATE INTERNET USERS
&gt;                                        
&gt;    InfoWorld
&gt;    25-OCT-97
&gt;    By Rebecca Sykes
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    CompuServe last week announced an online product targeted at business
&gt;    Internet users.
&gt;    
&gt;    The offering, called C from CompuServe, will combine CompuServe's
&gt;    features, such as its forums, in new ways to appeal to Internet-savvy
&gt;    business users who require different functions from the Web than
&gt;    consumers, according to Bob Kington, executive producer of CSi, the
&gt;    company's online service.
&gt;    
&gt;    The Internet "is great for surfers; it's not good for busy business
&gt;    people," Kington said. Business people "want to get on, get their
&gt;    information, and get off [of the Internet]."
&gt;    
&gt;    C for CompuServe will assist them in doing so by packaging
&gt;    CompuServe's assets in new ways. Instead of following the model of
&gt;    CSi, the company's current online offering that gives paying
&gt;    subscribers full access to all forums and other CompuServe resources,
&gt;    C will offer access on three levels.
&gt;    
&gt;    * The Guest level will provide free, read-only access to CompuServe's
&gt;    500 forums to all Web users. Guest-level users also will have access
&gt;    to forums' reciprocal links to thousands of Web sites selected for
&gt;    their relevance to the forums' topics.
&gt;    
&gt;    * The Member level will operate on a pay-per-transaction basis to
&gt;    provide access to hundreds of research databases. Users enter their
&gt;    credit-card information online once and then are charged small amounts
&gt;    for functions they perform.
&gt;    
&gt;    * The Subscriber level will offer three options. One will feature full
&gt;    interactive access to forums, including posting and receiving
&gt;    messages, and will cost less than $10 per month. The other two
&gt;    options, which will each be priced quite a bit lower, are a
&gt;    subscription to integrated e-mail, voice mail, fax, and pager services
&gt;    and a subscription to Computing Pro, a value-added service for
&gt;    computing professionals.
&gt;    
&gt;    The service, free to current CSi users, will be available by year's
&gt;    end.
&gt;    
&gt;    Asked whether CompuServe was acting prematurely given the impending
&gt;    acquisition by America Online of its online assets, Steve Conway,
&gt;    CompuServe vice president of corporate communications, said it was
&gt;    just moving ahead with plans it had before AOL made its bid.
&gt;    
&gt;    CompuServe Inc., in Columbus, Ohio, can be reached at (614) 457-8600.
&gt;    America Online Inc., in Dulles, Va., can be reached at (703) 448-8700.
