&gt; I can understand the pressures on PGP to support key escrow. 

There is reasonable justification for key escrow, or recovery features
for _stored_ encrypted information.  The rate at which people forget
passwords alone suggests that this would be a good idea.

However the PGP design does much more than that: it allows third and
fourth parties to decrypt messages in transit.

&gt; The problem with PGP's move is that it is the first significant
&gt; break by the Internet software provider community. This will make it
&gt; much easier for Netscape or Microsoft to cave in.

I think they could have implemented recovery of stored encrypted
files, and of saved email archives more easily without including
recovery information over the wire.  It's a security risk to send
recovery encrypted info over the wire encrypted to long term public
keys.

&gt; It will also build the pressure on them.
&gt; I wonder what would happen to Bills problem with the DoJ if he had a sudden
&gt; change of heart. Somehow I don't see Netscape and Microsoft holding the line
&gt; on GAK if PGP are happily exporting their product and grabbing market share.
&gt; 
&gt; I really did not expect Phil Zimmerman to be the first to blink.

Me either.

&gt; I also don't understand it from the corporate perspective. PGP may be
&gt; picking up some business in the corporate market but at the cost of
&gt; alienating a significant part of the hacker community which has been his
&gt; best supporter up till now. I would think his best strategy would have been
&gt; to build on this customer base rather than sell it out at the first
&gt; opportunity.

He could have built storage escrow with much less argument; almost no
argument in comparison I would expect.

&gt; If Phil Z. wants to get into the Enterprise market he is going to have to
&gt; start speaking their language. Most companies today are looking for open
&gt; standards. PGP may have been the de facto security solution three years ago
&gt; but the reality today is several million copies of Comminicator and Explorer
&gt; with S/MIME built in. 

The obvious thing I think is for pgp to build systems which can
automatically interoperate with either.
