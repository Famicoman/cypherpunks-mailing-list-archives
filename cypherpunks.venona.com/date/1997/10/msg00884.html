&gt; &gt;From Bill Stewart's report, given the apparent amount of effort PGP
&gt; &gt;have put into their CMR based enforcement policy functionality, I
&gt; &gt;predict they won't remove CMR whatever we, or Schneier, or anyone else
&gt; &gt;says or proves about more secure less GAK-friendly ways of
&gt; 
&gt; They've got customers who wanted it; 

Whoa there Bill.  They have customers who wanted data recovery.  Data
recovery does not require CMR.

Did they admit to customers who wanted human based email screening?
No on list discussions have suggested this is the case.  I think I saw
one PGP employee state that it was not the case.

(I have perfectly good, more secure CDR based human screening designs,
not that I encourage this you understand).

&gt; there's some room for making it less controllable within their
&gt; current framework (e.g. making the behaviour for (as-yet unused)
&gt; multiple CMRKs to be session-key-splitting rather than
&gt; one-copy-per-CMRK, which is be the more obvious implementation and
&gt; is far more GAK-friendly.)

Small difference I think.

&gt; Also, the SMTP filter stuff won't go away - even if PGP Inc
&gt; dropped the product and dropped the CMRK from PGP 5.5.1 and
&gt; all future versions, once there's an API for PGP,
&gt; it's a piece of cake to write one; 

Nothing against SMTP filters, just against the CMR enforcement they
put into theirs.

&gt; you just don't get the visibility that some keys are CMRKers, 
&gt; and you've got the inconvenience of sending more bouncegrams to 
&gt; senders telling them "to send a copy of PGP-encrypted mail to Bob,
&gt; you need to also encrypt it to Eve The PostMistress" or, 
&gt; less honestly, "... to the Exchange Gateway".
&gt; And at least the PGP SMTP filter only checks for the KeyID and
&gt; doesn't actually try to deccrypt the message.

You're using "you can hack around it" and "it is visible" arguments,
these are valid arguments which mitigate the danger, but don't
actually alter Tim and my points that storage recovery is less of a
problem than message recovery.

&gt; &gt;I also suspect they won't 
&gt; &gt;listen to Tim's earlier argument that they do nothing about recovery
&gt; 
&gt; I thought Tim's point was directed to OpenPGP; 

He made the same point in both respects.  I agree with his point about
openPGP.

I fully agree with Tim's points and Bill Frantz's example that old
email messages come back to haunt people and are a nightmare waiting
for a discovery process in a messy lawsuit for companies.  I nearly
got sucked into such a thing myself last year (some one gave back a
laptop to a company they just quit on bad terms from, tried to wipe it
but left some messages on it; the messages looked _bad_, the idiot who
did that sent the _bad_ message to me, my response was to phone him up
and say `what _are_ you talking about, I can't do that'.).

This to me argues that PGP Inc should make email archives user
controllable.  So that users decide which emails to archive and which
to just let naturally disappear, in the same way that phone calls, or
chats in a restaurant aren't transcibed and digitally signed.  Much
harder to prove.  I would also argue for "official statement" vs "chit
chat" distinction on emails -- don't archive, and certainly don't have
recovery of chit chat, use non-transferable sigs for chit chat, the
only person who cares about authenticity is the recipient, not the
legal system.  So I think this aspect belongs in coding in ways which
are beneficial to companies.

&gt; Jon Callas and others
&gt; said things like ~~If you've got features you want done, 
&gt; propose it to OpenPGP and get them to adopt it, and that'll
&gt; give us a business reason that we ought to adopt it.~~
&gt; (I think the context of that was discussing Stealth, which they
&gt; still don't have enough business demand for to take time on,
&gt; and which by the way puts a major crimp in SMTP filters.)

I guess the smtp filters leave stuff alone if they can't figure out
who it's to?  ie do default email thang -- which is probably what you
want if it's some privacy nut who is sending a "chit chat" class
message to one of your set of sales people.  don't do the explode to
all feature.

&gt; &gt;This quote should give us clue as to why they will continue with CMR: 
&gt; &gt;	"we're a real company with accountants"
&gt; 
&gt; That wasn't an exact quote, just a paraphrase from my memory of 
&gt; several conversations.  

Sure.  It's also completely understandable that they do have financial
restrictions, my main argument was that they could build more GAK
resistant systems within those restrictions.

&gt; &gt;Similar arguments would presumably present them with "no choice" but
&gt; &gt;to fulfill the order for 100,000 GAK compliant units from the
&gt; &gt;government terrorizing the freedom fighters PRZ likes to tell us
&gt; &gt;about who are already using PGP GAK compliant software: pgp5.0.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if they did that, it wouldn't change the power relationships;
&gt; if the government can compel GAK keys by filtering SMTP or
&gt; confiscating non-eavesdropping-compatible mail gateways,
&gt; it doesn't matter if the Cc: Big Brother was added as a PGP5.5 CMRK
&gt; or as a PGP2.6.2i multiple recipient - you can't tell from
&gt; the message format (except for DH vs. RSA).

Yes, but you are in the US.  The recipient is in tinpotdictatorsville.
With pgp5.0 your software will by default honour the military police's
demand in tinpotdictatorsville.

This is why I am arguing that the system as a whole be considered --
you are trying to build GAK resistance into the deployed code base you
have to think long term and you have to think in terms of sabotaging
the system to make it unuseful to governments.

Consider also that software gets used in it's default configuration
95% of the time.  Not everyone is a information architect :-)

&gt; &gt;What can we do about this situation?  Well we could build systems
&gt; &gt;which hack around the CMR system.  Easy enough: just put dud
&gt; &gt;"recovery" info inside.  We still have deployment problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless I misunderstood the formats, 
&gt; CMRKs are just identified by KeyID, not by fingerprint,
&gt; and it's easy to look through the public keyservers to find CMRKs
&gt; (though companies may prefer to have their employees mail out
&gt; keys to people who need them rather than making all their
&gt; keys constantly visible on the outside servers.)
&gt; So go find them all, send protest email to the postmasters
&gt; and corporate officials at the companies that use CMRKs,
&gt; crank up your deadbeef generator to make your own keys
&gt; with the same KeyIDs as the CMRKs, and pre-load the public keyservers.
&gt; A nice touch would be to burn your copies of the private keys
&gt; for the CMRK imitators, but we'll never know if you did, will we?

OK, well that's some monkeywrenching, but I guess that could be
prevented with some design reviews.  I won't be helping with those
design reviews -- any company who wants to improve enforcement of CMR
type designs can figure them out for themselves.
