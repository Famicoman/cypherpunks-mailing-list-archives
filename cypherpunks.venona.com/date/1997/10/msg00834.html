[I am objecting to a proposal that seeks to ban one-way anonymous
remailers and other forms of unrepliable addresses such as spamblocked
addresses].

By all means, as one of the opponents of the proposal and supporter
of anonymity, I ask you to do so and also get your privacy-concerned
friends to take a close look at the debate.

For example, here's what the proponent said:

Mozena&gt;&gt;But, what do you have against anonymity?
Mozena&gt;
Mozena&gt;Nothing. What right do you have, though, to force me and others to
Mozena&gt;inconvenience ourselves so you can post anonymously or protect yourself
Mozena&gt;from spam?

* The RFD requires posters to use addresses which receive, and reply to,
* email; in other words, no munged, faked, spamblocked, or other
* bouncing or redirecting addresses.  There is nothing that says you
* must use your real name, or any other identifier, that tells who you
* really are.  If "the-return-of-zorro@example.com" receives and replies
* to email, it can be used to post to the proposed group.  "Anonymity",
* the ability to post without anyone knowing your true identity, is not
* really the issue.  Even anonymous remailers will work if they forward
* email in both directions.  But mungs and spamblocks will not work.

These are not anonymous remailers, they offer a much lower security,
they are not very reliable by their very design, and the only 
*true* anonymity can come from a one-way remailer.

The proposal, as it stands, seeks to outlaw the one-way anonymous
remailers.

* John Mozena's comment on anonymous posting services stems, I'm pretty
* sure, from an alternative offered by several folks.  The idea was:
* posters would add an 'X-Real-Address' line to their posts;  the
* moderation bot would use that line for correspondence, but remove it
* before making the post public.  John Mozena and others at CAUCE were
* unwilling to do this because of possible legal ramifications;  John
* likened it to running an anonymous posting service, and wondered what
* the consequences would be should someone use it to post copyrighted or
* sensitive information.

Well, this is NOT true. John objected to it with the argument that he
does not like unrepliable addresses appearing in newsgroups.

Anyway, all this talk about the X-Real_Address: field is NOT related to
true anonymity, by the very definition of the latter.
