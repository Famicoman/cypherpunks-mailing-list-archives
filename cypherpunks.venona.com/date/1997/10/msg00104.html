&gt; &gt; &gt; Those who are newcomers to the list should know that Vulis has never
&gt; &gt; &gt; presented any evidence substantiating his vague claims that Stronghold 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is insecure or has backdoors (or whatever the claims were).  Vulis is
&gt; &gt; &gt; conducting a personal vendetta against one of C2Net's staff members and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone who happened to be or become associated with him.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Nor do I have to present any evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; You misordered this: it should say "Nor do I have any evidence to 
&gt; present."

Nope.  Like I said, I'm not selling Stronghold or any competing product, I
don't lose anything when someone foolishly buys it, so why should I present
any evidence?  I (and several other people on this mailing list) were threatened
by C2Net's lawyers; so to avoid unpleasant disputes, I told them I won't be
publishing whatever I might know about their product.

&gt; &gt;                                         I'm not the one selling StrongHold.
&gt; 
&gt; No, you're the one trying to torpedo its sales to get back at certain
&gt; individuals for some perceived slight.

No I'm not.  What do I lose if someone not affiliated with me makes a
foolish purchasing decision?

That's why I complied with C2Net's request not to publish my opinions of
their product.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have received several threatening communications from C2Net's lawyers, 
&gt; &gt; which were discussed at length on this list.  To avoid unpleasant disputes
&gt; &gt; I agreed not to disseminate my opinions about StrongHold.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazingly, C2Net doesn't like to see its product publicly slandered 
&gt; by reptiles like Vulis.  If Vulis' opinion were based on anything
&gt; other than personal ill will - ie, if he had ever actually downloaded
&gt; and examined Stronghold and found any problems with it - he would have
&gt; a leg to stand on.  As it is, his allegations are completely unfounded.

If this were true, then C2Net would encourage me to publicly present whatever
"evidence" I have so they'd be able to refute it.  This is not what they
asked me to do.

&gt; &gt; Please keep this in mind if you consider buying it.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind that anything Vulis says is in all likelihood a complete
&gt; lie.

Keep in mind that "anonymous" is probably an employee of C2Net.  Several of
C2Net's shills used to post C2Net propaganda withouy revealing their C2Net
affiliation; they switched to anonymous remailers when their nyms were exposed.
