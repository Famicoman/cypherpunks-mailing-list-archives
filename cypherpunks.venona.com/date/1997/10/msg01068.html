This whole "company key", "department key", and "personal key" business seems
strangely similar to the hierarchical structure of an LDAP server.  I wonder where
we could store that information...  :-)

Just my 2¢.

&gt; Thanks. I want to add that what's in 5.5 is hardly what we think is
&gt; perfect. The system is designed simply to be preferable to key escrow. We
&gt; have some improvements we're planning for it in the future. So you're right
&gt; -- it's a short-term solution.
&gt;
&gt;    The current system sends out a user's personal key, with a tag to say that
&gt;    if I don't encrypt to the company as well, my mail will bounce. But think
&gt;    about this: how often do I want to send email to a particular person in a
&gt;    company, and ensure that only they see it? And how often do I want to send
&gt;    mail to a particular group inside a company? All I want is to ensure that
&gt;    I get a response from the company, I usually don't care who I talk to in
&gt; the
&gt;    process.
&gt;
&gt; You have it mostly right. There's a tag in a self-signature that says,
&gt; "please encrypt to this other key, too." The only time you are required to
&gt; encrypt to Alice's other key is if you and Alice share the same additional
&gt; key (and not always even then).
&gt;
&gt;    So PGP's "everything private unless you choose to make it public" system
&gt;    seems backwards. Surely what we really need to meet these customer demands
&gt;    is an "everything public (within the company) unless you choose to make it
&gt;    private" system? That is, all mail to my department inside the company
&gt;    should be encrypted to a department key, shared by all members, *unless*
&gt;    it is confidential, in which case it should *only* be encrypted to me.
&gt;
&gt; This is certainly possible with the system, and in fact easier to implement
&gt; than anything else.
&gt;
&gt;    Here's how I see this working: when Joe Blow joins Foo-Bah Cryptosystems,
&gt;    he creates his own personal PGP key. He also gets a copy of the department
&gt;    key, which he can use to decrypt any mail which is encrypted to his
&gt;    department; or this decryption could be handled automatically by a
&gt;    department email server to ensure that individuals never have access to the
&gt;    department's private key. PGP then creates a public key for 'Joe Blow
&gt;    &lt;joe.blow@foo-bah.com&gt;', which would be the department key with a signed
&gt; tag
&gt;    linking it to his personal public key. This is the tagged corporate public
&gt;    key which he would give out to any customers.
&gt;
&gt;    When a customer wishes to send email to Joe, he would use this public key.
&gt;    When encrypting, PGP would detect the tag and put up a dialog box pointing
&gt;    out that this is a corporate key and if they click on the 'confidential'
&gt;    button it will be encrypted to the user's personal key prior to encrypting
&gt;    to the corporate key (by which I mean superencryption, to avoid traffic
&gt;    analysis). The default would be not to superencrypt; and as a side effect
&gt;    this system would be compatible with any version of PGP for
&gt;    non-confidential mail (assuming that version understands the encryption
&gt;    algorithms in use).
&gt;
&gt;    The effect of this is that if someone wants to send email about an urgent
&gt;    bug and I'm out at lunch, any of my co-workers can read that mail. But if
&gt;    they want to send *me* mail about confidential inter-company negotiations,
&gt;    the co-workers could decrypt the outer layer of the message, but would be
&gt;    blocked by the inner layer encryption to my personal key.
&gt;
&gt;    As I see it, this system is simple, solves the problems which PGP claim
&gt;    they need to solve without creating the snooping problems Tim and others
&gt;    have discussed, cannot easily be adapted to GAK ('This message is to be
&gt;    encrypted to the FBI public key. If it is confidential, click here to
&gt;    superencrypt to the recipient's personal key'), and won't require a
&gt;    massive change to the PGP source code.
&gt;
&gt; This is exactly CMR. The only thing that Business 5.5 does is automatically
&gt; add the department for you, and put up the recipient dialog so it can be
&gt; taken off. Congrats.
&gt;
&gt;    There are some obvious security issues with having the department key
&gt;    shared amongst the members of the department, but I don't see that they
&gt;    are any worse than PGP's current CMR implementation, which has already
&gt;    discussed the use of department keys; it's certainly better than using
&gt;    plaintext. There are also problems with encrypting confidential mail to
&gt;    multiple recipients, but they're surmountable; an easy solution, if you
&gt;    don't care about traffic analysis, is to only encrypt confidential mail
&gt;    to the personal key rather than superencrypt with the corporate key. In
&gt; most
&gt;    cases such mail wouldn't be sent to multiple recipients anyway.
&gt;
&gt;    So here's how I'd see the simple system working:
&gt;
&gt;    A PGP CMR key would consist of
&gt;
&gt;    1. A corporate key; this might be company-wide, department-wide, or
&gt;       an individual escrowed key; this choice is a seperate key-management
&gt;       issue for the corporation.
&gt;    2. Optionally a personal key, which could only be decrypted by the
&gt;       individual.
&gt;    3. A signature from the corporate key linking the personal key to it
&gt;       and the specified User Id.
&gt;    4. Optional flag to indicate which key to encrypt to by default.
&gt;    5. User Id, signatures, etc
&gt;
&gt;    When PGP was asked to encrypt to such a key, it would check for the
&gt;    optional personal key. If it wasn't there, it would put up a warning
&gt;    box to tell the user that the message can be read by people other than
&gt;    the recipient. If it is, then it would put up a dialog box allowing the
&gt;    user to choose whether to encrypt to the corporate key or the individual
&gt;    key, normally defaulting to the corporate key. This system could not easily
&gt;    become GAK because it will only encrypt to one of the keys and not both;
&gt;    the FBI could create FBI CMR keys from all our public keys, but then PGP
&gt;    would either encrypt to the FBI and I wouldn't be able to read it, or
&gt;    encrypt to me and the FBI wouldn't be able to read it.
&gt;
&gt;    Anyone care to pick any holes?
&gt;
&gt; Looks good from here. You've redesigned PGP 5.5. Thanks.
