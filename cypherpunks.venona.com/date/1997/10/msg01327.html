&gt;                      FLAG BAN TUGS ON OLE MISS TRADITIONS
&gt;                                        
&gt;      Students wave Confederate flags
&gt;      
&gt;   Confederate banner impedes athletic recruiting
&gt;   
&gt;      October 25, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 10:44 p.m. EDT (0244 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      From Correspondent Brian Cabell
&gt;      
&gt;      OXFORD, Mississippi (CNN) -- On any given football Saturday, when
&gt;      the Ole Miss Rebels find the end zone and the crowd explodes, you
&gt;      can see Confederate flags being waved.
&gt;      
&gt;      But there are not nearly as many rebel flags as in years past -- and
&gt;      there will soon be even fewer if the University of Mississippi's
&gt;      chancellor has his way.
&gt;      
&gt;      This week, chancellor Robert Khayat ordered a ban on all sticks at
&gt;      athletic events, starting next week. It's ostensibly for safety
&gt;      reasons, but no one is fooled -- it is clearly an attempt to keep
&gt;      out the Confederate flags attached to those sticks. CNN's Brian
&gt;      Cabell reports
&gt;      icon 2 min., 1 sec. VXtreme streaming video
&gt;      
&gt;      At Ole Miss, tradition is grudgingly giving way to the political and
&gt;      social reality that the rebel flag is perceived by some people,
&gt;      particularly African Americans, as a racist symbol.
&gt;      
&gt;      "We're tired of the attention, the negative publicity that we're
&gt;      getting," said athletic director Pete Boone. "I mean, we've got a
&gt;      great university here, a great academic program, and we're being
&gt;      held back from a national perspective because of this Confederate
&gt;      flag."
&gt;      
&gt;      Saturday's football game against Alabama was the first since Khayat
&gt;      ordered the ban. And while the student senate this week also
&gt;      recommended that the rebel flags be left home, they were
&gt;      particularly visible in the student section.
&gt;      
&gt;      "Other people can do things and wave things and it's fine, but if we
&gt;      do it, it seems like it's racist," complained one student. "But it's
&gt;      not racist. We're proud of our Southern heritage."
&gt;      
&gt;      Ironically, many of those who have forsaken the flag are older Ole
&gt;      Miss fans, who express fears about what the Confederate flag in the
&gt;      stands does to the quality of the team on the field.
&gt;      
&gt;      Indeed, Ole Miss football coach Tommy Tuberville has told fans that
&gt;      the university is losing black recruits because of the flag. He says
&gt;      he's gratified that flags are disappearing.
&gt;      
&gt;      "I'm proud of our students and our fans, and I think they understand
&gt;      the situation," he said. "Hopefully, we can continue to make
&gt;      progress."
