<B>Subject:</B> Freedom of Encryption: Is it SAFE?<BR>
<B>From:</B> &quot;Michael Pierson&quot; &lt;wfgodot@advicom.net&gt;
<BR>
<B>To: </B>cypherpunks@cyberpass.net

<P>
There has been much discussion recently concerning how to fix
<BR>
certain flaws, or block various amendments in encryption<BR>
legislation being shepherded through Congress.  A far more<BR>
fundamental problem with these legislative efforts from the<BR>
beginning was that they involved an implicit concession to the
<BR>
idea that a U.S. citizen's freedom to privately exchange<BR>
information in whatever coding scheme he or she might choose<BR>
required some kind of government affirmation or ratification as
<BR>
validation.  Once one seeks for the government's deigning to<BR>
&quot;affirm the rights of United States persons to use and sell
<BR>
encryption&quot;, it can (and does) then easily proceed to attach
<BR>
conditions and caveats to these &quot;affirmed&quot; rights. 
In the<BR>
process the surveillance hawks within the government have<BR>
managed, with hardly any struggle, to advance the appearance of
<BR>
legitimacy for their claims of authority to regulate this form
of<BR>
expression. 
<P>
Now comes an expectation that the nature of these &quot;affirmed
<BR>
rights&quot; should be tailored to address &quot;the concerns
of national<BR>
security and the federal law enforcement community.&quot;  This
same<BR>
community has on occasion complained about how their efforts to
<BR>
fight organized crime and terrorism are being thwarted by not
<BR>
having the modern newspeak disguised equivalent of &quot;Writs
of <BR>
Assistance&quot; (and they are arguably making progress toward
<BR>
acquiring just such powers IMO).  Very few politicians are <BR>
willing to commit the heresy of clearly and staunchly asserting
<BR>
that the information coding methods used by citizens are under
<BR>
no obligation to pass any litmus test, or to be subject to any
<BR>
kind of prior approval or restraint determined by criteria of
<BR>
the law enforcement establishment or anyone else.  If the Feds
<BR>
lament that this will make their job harder, too bad.  In the
<BR>
words of Orson Welles: &quot;Only in a police state is the job
of a <BR>
policeman easy.&quot; 
<P>
When these various legislative efforts attempted to reach beyond
<BR>
the issues of export restrictions to address those of domestic
<BR>
use, they became a doubtful and dangerous fix to something that
<BR>
wasn't broke in the first place.  If the Government is intent
on<BR>
&quot;abridging the freedom&quot; to use strong encryption domestically,
a<BR>
legislative affirmation of these rights is feeble comfort at<BR>
best.  If I'm seeking to protect my possessions, I don't ask a
<BR>
thief to affirm my property rights. 
<P>
Of course, even the export question is really about the aims of
<BR>
the state's surveillance constituency to obstruct the wide<BR>
deployment of strong encryption domestically, and its<BR>
interoperability on the internet as a whole.  Challenging the
<BR>
derisible bogosity of the &quot;preventing the Evil Ones from
<BR>
acquiring this technology&quot; rationale that is invoked to justify
<BR>
these restrictions was not something legislation was likely to
do<BR>
with any great vigor.  Legislation to &quot;relax&quot; these
restrictions<BR>
involves lending credence to the dubious assumption that these
<BR>
restrictions had any constitutional validity to begin with. 
<P>
Any bill that would have truly provided for the statutory<BR>
endorsement of the acceptably uncompromised use of strong<BR>
encryption never really had much more than a snowball's chance
in<BR>
hell of actually being signed into law given the current<BR>
political balance of power, did it?  Far more likely, was that
it<BR>
could be corrupted and hijacked as a vehicle to further the very
<BR>
type of restrictions it was purportedly intended to relieve. 
A<BR>
collateral consequence is an increased arrogance and presumption
<BR>
among lawmakers that it is their prerogative to act to define
for<BR>
us citizens, what freedoms for domestic use of encryption we<BR>
should be permitted.  The growing gallery of GAK amendments and
<BR>
competing legislative proposals now emerging appears to support
<BR>
this sad scenario. 
<P>
It's starting to look like the prospects for meaningfully<BR>
improving the situation with encryption legislation in the<BR>
current political environment were about as promising as the<BR>
prospects of a neophyte gambler coming out ahead at a crooked
<BR>
casino.  I expect any apparent winnings in the end will come with
<BR>
a catch between the lines in the fine print, if they come at all.
<BR>
In any case, whatever is legislatively affirmed can later be<BR>
legislatively denied.  What a King presumes is his to grant, he
<BR>
usually presumes is his to revoke as well. 
<P>
In the end, what will have really been gained by this legislative
<BR>
venture, and what will have been explicitly or implicitly<BR>
surrendered?  As I see it, at this point the issue isn't about
<BR>
counting wins, it's about cutting losses. 
<P>
Freedom of encryption.... Is it SAFE?  I don't think so. 
<P>

<P>
    [Tim] said this before Christmas last year as an erudite and
lengthy<BR>
    addendum to my lengthy tome: &quot;Cypherpunks as Philosophy
Kings&quot; <BR>
    that pretty well summed our generally mutually agreed &quot;philosophy&quot;.

    both were and still are worth reading; anybody who does not

<P>
    but cypherpunk terrorists are not violent; this is all about
making<BR>
    information free and protecting privacy with technology.
<P>
    despite the fact the Commerce Committee effectively killed
SAFE<BR>
    (or we think they did until Oxley tries to tack his amendment

    structure on an appropriations bill in a house-senate conference
or<BR>
    &quot;manager's mark&quot; procedure (whatever that is)),
we can not drop the <BR>
    due diligence, and the public must be aroused, called to battle.
<BR>
    even if there is no action, prepare for the next fire drill.
sow the<BR>
    seeds of dissension.
<P>
    seems to me we were sure the CDA was dead --except it slipped
in with <BR>
    a manager's mark after the house voted almost unanimously
the other<BR>
    way (402-12 or something like that). the capitol hill sleaze
<BR>
    took a grand slam NO and reported an even worse yes, making
it part<BR>
    of a major bill that absolutely was going to pass --and they
<BR>
    have the gall to call that travesty democracy?  Teddy Roosevelt:

        &quot;It is difficult to make our material condition better
by the <BR>
        best law, but it is easy enough to ruin it by bad laws.&quot;
<P>
    Tim's message for Christmas last was the prophetic call for
direct<BR>
    action; legal action; empowerment action: Robert H. Jackson

        &quot;It is not the function of our Government to keep

    the sleazeball, who intends to make J Edgar look like a piker
at <BR>
    surveillance, has the gleam of unabridged power in his eyes.
Louis <BR>
    F[reeh,uck] is charming, even disarming, as he tells a Congressional
<BR>
    committee:<BR>
        &quot;We are potentially the most dangerous agency in
the <BR>
        country if we are not scrutinized carefully.&quot; (Jun
'97)
<P>
    meaning the FBI will be the most powerful [feared] federal
agency?<BR>
    really?  I thought it was already, although the DEA and BATF
have <BR>
    worked hard for the title, too.
<P>
    Supreme Justice Louis O. Brandeis said:<BR>
        &quot;The greatest danger to liberty lurks in insidious
encroachment <BR>
        by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.&quot;
<P>
    and the [London] Electronic Telegraph, on Sunday's front page:
<BR>
        Mr. Freeh has won $370 million (&uacute;230 million) of
<BR>
        funding for 2,000 new posts, boosted the number of<BR>
        active agents to more than 11,000, and expanded<BR>
        open-ended &quot;domestic security operations&quot; from
100 in<BR>
        1995 to more than 800.  Twenty-three new FBI offices<BR>
        are opening abroad.
<P>
    and more:
<P>
        But none of this will contain the director's ambitions
<BR>
        or his power.  He is now believed to be eyeing two<BR>
        other &quot;secret police&quot; forces - the Drug Enforcement
<BR>
        Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
<BR>
        - with a long-term view to a takeover.
<P>
    F[reeh,uck] holds the key to the Clinton's' ambitions; the
Clintons <BR>
    cite the Roosevelts as their mentors; Hillary even communes
with the<BR>
    long dead Eleanor. Bubba's stated goals included extending
FDR's <BR>
    &quot;chicken in every pot&quot; --he's just appeasing the
crowd now.
<P>
    Leopards do not change their spots, but Bubba has shifted
to the <BR>
    right with public opinion; he is just like the leopard: playing
with<BR>
    his food until sufficient presidential powers have been accumulated
<BR>
    by the default of Congress and the people.
<P>
    But, the INFORMATION REVOLUTION now stands in way of the Clinton
<BR>
    plans; the Internet can destroy the media control now exercised
by<BR>
    the acquiescence of the five Jewish media barons. In fact,
it is <BR>
    destroying their monopoly.
<P>
<CENTER><B>THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION IS THE CONTROL OF POWER.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
    Why does F[reeh,uck] hold the key?  Because his job is to
sell the <BR>
    Congress on strangling the information revolution before it
destroys<BR>
    truthless governments F[reeh,uck]'s masters understand and
control.
<P>
    Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated on 4 Mar 33 stating:
<BR>
        &quot;I am prepared under my constitutional duty to <BR>
        recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the<BR>
        midst of a stricken world may require.  These<BR>
        measures, or such other measures as the Congress may<BR>
        build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall<BR>
        seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring<BR>
        to speedy adoption.  But in the event that the<BR>
        Congress shall fall to take one of these two <BR>
        courses, and in the event that the national<BR>
        emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the<BR>
        clear course of duty that will then confront me.  I<BR>
        shall ask the Congress for the one remaining<BR>
        instrument to meet the crisis broad Executive power<BR>
        to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the<BR>
        power that would be given to me if we were in fact<BR>
        invaded by a foreign foe.&quot;
<P>
    and, on 9 Mar 33, 5 days later, FDR extracted from an uniformed
<BR>
    and essentially special session of Congress:<BR>
        &quot;Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives
of<BR>
        the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
the<BR>
        Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists
and<BR>
        that it is imperatively necessary speedily to put into
effect<BR>
        remedies of uniform national application.&quot;
<P>
    which was based on the War Powers Act (trading with the Enemy)
of<BR>
    1917 which was hastily revised to include US Citizens which
had been<BR>
    exempted. Next, FDR &quot;franchised&quot; the banks, &quot;licensed&quot;
agriculture<BR>
    and so on. But, to render the citizens powerless and to confiscate
<BR>
    all assets so the national state was the ultimate owner, and
<BR>
    therefore able to pledge the people for credit to the international
<BR>
    bankers, the fundamental monetary system changed:<BR>
        &quot;Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of the
<BR>
        Treasury, such action is necessary to protect the <BR>
        currency system of the United States, the Secretary <BR>
        of the Treasury, in his discretion, may require any <BR>
        or all individuals, partnerships, associations and <BR>
        corporations to pay and deliver to the Treasurer <BR>
        of the United States any or all gold coin, gold<BR>
        bullion, and gold certificates owned by such <BR>
        individuals, partnerships, associations and <BR>
        corporations.&quot; 
<P>
    which closed the loop and made every US citizen chattel as
FDR <BR>
    pledged the good faith and credit of the United States to
the <BR>
    international bankers --in return, an unbelievable flood of
credit <BR>
    was available since the good faith and credit of the United
States <BR>
    is &quot;We the People....&quot;  but FDR sold us downstream
into a debt <BR>
    financed economy from which there is no escape; we are still
there,<BR>
    the debt service is destroying any permanent economy AND total
<BR>
    collapse under the debt load is bequeathed to our children.
<P>
    Congress repealed FDR's rubber stamp for the &quot;President&quot;
in 1973,<BR>
    but the War Powers Act remains, still modified to treat US
<BR>
    citizens as the enemy. and the power of the &quot;President&quot;
to make <BR>
    those regulations, and the automatic approval are enshrined
for<BR>
    current and future Presidents in Title 12 USC 95(b)<BR>
        &quot;The actions, regulations, rules, licenses, orders
and <BR>
        proclamations heretofore or hereafter taken, promulgated,
made,<BR>
        or issued by the President of the United States or the
Secretary<BR>
        of the Treasury since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to
the<BR>
        authority conferred by subdivision (b) of Section 5 of
the Act<BR>
        of October 6, 1917, as amended, are hereby approved and
<BR>
        confirmed.&quot;
<P>
    The real issue is the President and the fat cat power brokers
can <BR>
    get away with these shenanigans __as_long_as_the_people_let_them__.
<BR>
    We are still under the Rule of Necessity. We are still in
a declared<BR>
    state of national emergency, a state of emergency which has
existed,<BR>
    uninterrupted, since 1933.  
<P>
    FDR's licensing agencies were rather trivial in number; today
there <BR>
    are thousands of them, many with their own administrative
courts. <BR>
    FDR took away our common law when he bankrupted America, which
is a <BR>
    national corporation under the Hague convention (courtesy
of Stanton<BR>
    and Seward after the Civil War).  Bankruptcy is a contract,
and <BR>
    we are the bait, subject to that court, which is in effect
an <BR>
    Admiralty court, and we are &quot;licensed&quot; to literally
exist by FDR's <BR>
    Social Security Number schema. and every courtroom now flies
the <BR>
    fringed Admiralty flag where habeas corpus is a privilege,
not a <BR>
    right, if it exists at all.
<P>
    This is the importance of Louis F[reeh,uck].  He, and Janet
Reno as <BR>
    the DOJ rubber stamp, are holding the collar for your neck.
They<BR>
    are selling it to you little by little, or even all at once.
<P>
    Why Louis F[reeh,uck]?  Madison Avenue style with credentials;
he<BR>
    can sell the program. F[reeh,uck] is the front man, the schill.
<P>
    Machiavelli, in his &quot;Discourses of Livy,&quot; acknowledged
that great <BR>
    power may have to be given to the Executive if the State is
to<BR>
    survive, but warned of great dangers in doing so.  He cautioned:
<BR>
        Nor is it sufficient if this power be conferred <BR>
        upon good men; for men are frail, and easily <BR>
        corrupted, and then in a short time, he that is <BR>
        absolute may easily corrupt the people.&quot;

    rights of the people, America would be the home of the free,
not big<BR>
    government, not freeloaders and the welfare state; not the
leftovers<BR>
    of a once great nation.
<P>
    give us the rights Abraham Lincoln cherished lovingly:<BR>
     &quot;Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for
themselves.&quot;
<P>
    let _them_, not me, live the downside.
<P>
    George Washington, in his farewell address, warned:<BR>
       &quot;... change by usurpation; for through this, <BR>
        in one instance, may be the instrument of good, <BR>
        it is the customary weapon by which free <BR>
        governments are destroyed.&quot;
<P>
    cypherpunk philosopher kings: pick up your picks and shovels,
get <BR>
    your hands dirty, and start digging in; it's going to be a
long and <BR>
    difficult campaign and the tactics needed to expose F[reeh,uck]'s
<BR>
    true intentions as the schill for the Clintons who are schills
<BR>
    for the elitist leading the destruction of American democracy.
<P>
    The Congressional compromise love match season isn't over
yet; the<BR>
    schmoozers and lobbyists, like so many furry rats, still wander
the<BR>
    dark halls and tunnels looking for the last, late in the season,
<BR>
    clandestine and obscene fuck.  any whore will do.
<P>
    lobbyists have long reputations for selling out the interests
of<BR>
    their paymasters; the lobbyists are so much a part of the
Washington<BR>
    culture that they have _no_ morality or moral position --it
is all<BR>
    about who they can claim to have influenced --what difference
does<BR>
    it make if it is contrary to the client --the art of the deal,
<BR>
    protect their own position and find newer, richer clients
--whores!<BR>
    logrolling and porkbarrel voting --but never go home without
a deal;<BR>
    used car salesmanship: get your man.
<P>
    I can hear the lobbyists whining now as they are called on
the <BR>
    carpet:<BR>
        &quot;aw, come on Mac, we got you a compromise from LEA
demands...&quot;
<P>
    never realizing that there is such an action as NO bill, they
sell <BR>
    out half our rights blocking legislation which would never
happen.
<P>
    they claim they got back half. what half? --some unknown half
that <BR>
    we _never_ lost!  that is why:<BR>
        The 10 Commandments contain 297 words. The Bill of Rights
is <BR>
        stated in 463 words. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains
266<BR>
        words; and: <BR>
        A recent federal directive to regulate the price of cabbage
<BR>
        contains 26,911 words. (The Atlanta Journal)
<P>
    send the quisling Neville Chamberlains to the gas chambers!
<P>
    the public needs to be educated, not in crypto, but in the
horrors of     <BR>
    an oligarchy which intends to destroy the fundamental freedoms
on <BR>
    which we stand.  
<P>
    publish his credit records; publish his medical records --tell
his<BR>
    neighbors about his visits from Child Protective Services...
then<BR>
    Joe Coach Potato will figure out he needs something
<P>
       <B> AFTER he figures out there are fuckors and fuckees,
<BR>
        and he's on the short end of that stick. [pardon my French]</B>
<P>
    then, and only then, will the masses understand privacy --when
they <BR>
    have lost it. 
<P>
    either we show the people before they lose everything to uncle,
<BR>
    or...    just dump it on the table to show everyone just how
much<BR>
    uncle knows about _you_.
<P>
 <B>   Attila's thought for the day:<BR>
</B>      Now, with a black jack mule you wish to harness, you
walk up, <BR>
      look him in the eye, and hit him with a 2X4 over the left
eye.   <BR>
      If he blinks, hit him over the right eye! He'll cooperate.
 <BR>
          --so will politicians.
<P>
    Louis F]reeh,uck], did you really state this hoping everyone
would <BR>
    think you are joking? <BR>
        &quot;We are potentially the most dangerous agency in
the <BR>
        country if we are not scrutinized carefully.&quot;
<P>
    Louis F[reeh,uck], you obviously know that telling the truth,
before <BR>
    the truth is really the truth, disarms your opposition since
they <BR>
    can plainly see that it is not true.
<P>
    there is a limit to what you can endure before you must stand
to <BR>
    be counted --so I will loudly echo Tim's sentiment: <BR>
+<BR>
<B>+When Cypherpunks are called &quot;terrorists,&quot; we will
have done our jobs</B>.<BR>
+<BR>
 --<BR>
 &quot;Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in
no other.&quot;     <BR>
        --Benjamin Franklin
