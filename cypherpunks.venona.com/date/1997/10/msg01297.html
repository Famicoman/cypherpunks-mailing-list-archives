&gt; Subject: Re: poverty traps (Re: Sa

&gt; Although my statement was deliberately somewhat exaggerated, it is
&gt; not that far from reality for quite a few people I know.
&gt; 
&gt; A real-life example:

&gt; Is she to be called "stupid" and "selfish" because she's poor
&gt; despite her efforts???
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think so. She, btw., is not the only person I know
&gt; struggeling in this manner from one month into the next, barely
&gt; being able to even catch up on bills.

I know quite few people in that sort of situation.

&gt; Neither does she have a free choice of employers. There is only one
&gt; board of education in the City. Changing for a private school would
&gt; come with (at least a temporary) pay-cut, that she obviously can't
&gt; afford.

I must disagree there. She has the qualifications to obtain employment in
may corporations and such. As a matter of fact, unless she happens to be
inequivicaly wedded to live in her current abode have her send me her
resume. I will be quite happy to submit it to the H/R department at Tivoli
(an IBM company I admit) for a position in our training department (last
time I checked they had like 90 positions they wanted to fill globaly). I
can guarantee the cost of living is somewhat lower than NY here in Texas
and her pay will most likely be higher than current. There is also the
opportunity for global travel if she is interested and were to get hired.

Sending out resumes is cheap, about $.40 a company.

&gt; Therefore:
&gt; 
&gt; Since she isn't the only person I can think of, who is in such a
&gt; position, the argument formerly known as "If 'ya don't like the
&gt; company-policy [employing GAK/CAK] just leave and work for
&gt; somebody else" may now be called: "Ad Acta".

Obviously this is open to alternate interpretation depending upon to what
lengths the party is willing to go to change their life. Skills are what you
sell not a particular job title or duty set.

Complacency and despondancy can be opportunity killers.

[I have attached my 'long' .sig both to include the Tivoli address and to
 aggravate those who bitch about the length of my 'short' .sig]

         Political ideal: The Constitution says "Congress shall make
                          no law..." &amp; What happened to the 9th &amp;
                          10th Amendments?

         Philosophy: Pantheism - the belief that everything is divine,
                                 that God is not seperate but totaly
                                 identified with the cosmos, and that
                                 God does not possess personality or
                                 transcendence.

            For a succesful technology, reality must take precedence
            over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.

            Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the
            government of himself.  Can he, then, be trusted with
            the government of others? Or have we found angels in the
            forms of kings to govern him?  Let history answer this
            question.
