&gt; Subject: FW: USA - Bill Gates wants your guns
&gt; 
&gt; Don't like Bill Gates or his octopus like grip on the software market? Been 
&gt; looking for a reason to give Microsoft the finger and shop elsewhere? Well, 
&gt; here it is.........
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; by HUNTER T. GEORGE
&gt; OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - A gun-control measure on the Washington ballot has
&gt; turned into a Western shootout in this state, where nearly one out of
&gt; five residents owns a pistol.
&gt; In this gun battle, the two sides are armed with cash and
&gt; soundbites.
&gt; On one side is the state medical association, law enforcement
&gt; leaders, religious groups, the state's largest teachers union and
&gt; Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, among other Seattle-area business
&gt; leaders.
&gt; They back the measure, which would require handgun owners to
&gt; pass an exam or take an eight-hour safety course to get a license.
&gt; It would also require trigger locks on all handguns sold or
&gt; transferred in the state.
&gt; On the other side are gun rights organizations, like the
&gt; National Rifle Association, and police groups, which say the
&gt; measure is an invasion of privacy, an infringement of the right to
&gt; bear arms and a smokescreen for a hidden agenda: registration and
&gt; eventual confiscation of handguns.
&gt; ``What they're doing is basically using children and hiding
&gt; behind a phony handgun safety ballot title,'' said Alan Gottlieb,
&gt; chairman of the Bellevue-based Citizens Committee for the Right to
&gt; Keep and Bear Arms. ``These people don't want education. They want
&gt; to make it very hard for people to buy a handgun or use one, and
&gt; that's exactly what this initiative does.''
&gt; If voters OK the measure on the Nov. 4 ballot, Washington will pass some
&gt; of the strictest gun laws in the nation.
&gt; Only a dozen states require some sort of handgun permit or
&gt; license, and just two - Massachusetts and Connecticut - have passed
&gt; laws requiring trigger locks, but only at the retail level. Washington's
&gt; would require them on all guns sold, even person to person.
&gt; Nine of the nation's largest gun makers announced Thursday that
&gt; they would provide childproof locks with all of their new handguns
&gt; - - about 80 percent of those sold in the United States. President
&gt; Clinton has pushed for legislation requiring the locks, but House
&gt; and Senate committees rejected the provision earlier this year.
&gt; No public polls on the measure have been released so far, but
&gt; some of the richest people in the state back it: Gates gave
&gt; $35,000; his father, lawyer William H. Gates, donated $150,000, and
&gt; philanthropist Harriet Stimson Bullitt contributed $50,000.
&gt; The safety requirements, they say, would be like taking a
&gt; driver's test before getting a license. The goal is to reduce
&gt; accidental shootings, particularly those involving children who find
&gt; loaded guns in the home.
&gt; A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found
&gt; that 30 people 19 or younger died in unintentional shootings in
&gt; Washington state between 1991 and 1995. And 211 others were
&gt; hospitalized for gunshot wounds.
&gt; `I'm personally unwilling to tolerate that kind of carnage in
&gt; our state,'' said Dr. Roy Farrell, campaign spokesman and a gun
&gt; owner. ``Terrible tragedies happen that shouldn't happen if the gun
&gt; was stored properly.''
