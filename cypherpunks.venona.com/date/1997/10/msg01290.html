&gt;          JUDGE CLAMPS DOWN ON FLORIDA MAN FOR FILING TOO MANY LAWSUITS
&gt;                                        
&gt;    AP
&gt;    25-OCT-97
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    MIAMI (AP) Enough is enough. Chief U.S. District Judge Edward Davis
&gt;    said he is tired of reading "rambling, incomprehensible diatribes"
&gt;    directed at everyone from Elizabeth Dole to William Rehnquist.
&gt;    
&gt;    So Davis has ordered Robert Parker of Deerfield Beach to get his
&gt;    written permission before filing any more lawsuits. Parker has filed
&gt;    at least 85 federal suits in 10 years.
&gt;    
&gt;    In dismissing the latest batch of 11 suits, Davis said Parker has
&gt;    argued that "three presidents, the chief justice of the Supreme Court,
&gt;    the CIA, the FBI, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, every judge and
&gt;    magistrate in this district, as well as numerous executives of the
&gt;    American Red Cross and related entities engaged in a massive civil and
&gt;    criminal conspiracy to deprive Parker of employment, his marriage,
&gt;    access to the federal courts and, indeed, his very life."
&gt;    
&gt;    Parker's displeasure apparently stems from his five-year employment
&gt;    with the Red Cross until 1972, and an executive's alleged remark to
&gt;    his next employer that he was fired for stealing.
&gt;    
&gt;    "The bottom line is that this district has expended enough of its
&gt;    scarce resources administering the same complaint from Parker," Davis
&gt;    wrote Thursday.
&gt;    
&gt;    Parker's home telephone number is not listed and he could not be
&gt;    reached for comment.
