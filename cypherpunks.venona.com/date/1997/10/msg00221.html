&gt;"Data Protection in the United States: A Rising Tide?"
&gt;
&gt;Marc Rotenberg
&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center
&gt;Washington, DC
&gt;
&gt;17 September 1997
&gt;19th Intentional Conference on Data Protection
&gt;Brussels, Belgium
&gt;
&gt;      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. I am
&gt;grateful for the opportunity to be with you this morning.
&gt;
&gt;      I will speak today on behalf of consumers and users of
&gt;the Internet in the United States. There are few issues of
&gt;greater concern to us than the protection of privacy. You can
&gt;read about this in our newspapers and our magazines. Privacy
&gt;stories routinely appear on the front pages of national
&gt;magazines and in the daily newspapers. In just the past few
&gt;weeks stories about privacy have appeared in Time Magazine,
&gt;the Washington Post and USA Today. So extensive is our
&gt;discussion of privacy concerns that we even export the news
&gt;of our problems. I found a story from the New York Times
&gt;about the use of the Internet to collect detailed personal
&gt;information on the front page of the International Herald
&gt;Tribune that I purchased yesterday morning here in Brussels.
&gt;
&gt;      We believe that strong measures must be taken to
&gt;protect personal privacy. You can see this in our responses
&gt;to public polls. We have consistently expressed concern about
&gt;the loss of privacy, and we have consistently shown support
&gt;for new legislation to protect privacy.
&gt;
&gt;      We know that law is often an imperfect solution, but we
&gt;are also firm believers in the rule of law. You will
&gt;recognize this if you trace the development of privacy law in
&gt;the United States over the twentieth century. You can see
&gt;this if you understand that our country has always shown
&gt;great regard for the right of privacy and expressed
&gt;widespread concern when privacy was at risk.
&gt;
&gt;      So, when I say to you today that privacy is a great
&gt;concern in the United States and that we need to do much more
&gt;to protect it, I do so with the newspaper stories piled high,
&gt;the polling numbers unambiguous, and with a respect for
&gt;history that makes clear that few rights in American life are
&gt;more greatly valued than the right to protect private life.
&gt;
&gt;      I will speak now to the three central issues that need
&gt;to be addressed to build a bridge between the United States
&gt;and Europe so that we can enter the information society
&gt;together with mutual standards that protect the privacy
&gt;rights of our citizens . The first issue concerns current
&gt;attitudes of consumers in the United States and the current
&gt;policies of government. The second concerns the short-comings
&gt;of self- regulation. My final point is two recommendations
&gt;for how we should proceed.
&gt;
&gt;      First, it is clear the consumers and users of the
&gt;Internet favor the passage of law to protect personal
&gt;privacy. Professor Westin found this year that 58% of the
&gt;American public want government o pass law to protect privacy
&gt;now. And 24% said that government should formally recommend
&gt;privacy standards. Only 15% favored letting groups develop
&gt;voluntary privacy standards and government taking action only
&gt;if real problems arise.
&gt;
&gt;      Professor Westin's results are consistent with other
&gt;surveys of attitudes toward privacy in the United States. A
&gt;1991 poll conducted by Time Magazine found that 93% of the
&gt;U.S . public felt that companies that sell personal
&gt;information to others should be required to obtain explicit
&gt;permission. And the most comprehensive poll of Internet users
&gt;ever undertaken found that users of the Internet in the
&gt;United States, on a 1 to 5 scale, said that the Internet
&gt;needs new laws to protect privacy at a level of 3.8.
&gt;
&gt;      Public support for privacy legislation is clear.
&gt;
&gt;      Second, it is also clear that some political leaders
&gt;favor the adoption of privacy law. While it is true that the
&gt;White House has expressed the opinion that privacy
&gt;legislation is unnecessary at this time, members of Congress
&gt;are of a different opinion. Bills have been introduced in the
&gt;House and the Senate that address a wide range of privacy
&gt;issues. One bill would limit the disclosure of Social
&gt;Security Numbers. Another bill would prohibit Internet
&gt;Service Providers from disclosing customer information
&gt;without consent. A third bill restricts the ability of direct
&gt;marketers to sell information about young children. Several
&gt;bills have been introduced to address public concern about
&gt;unsolicited commercial email. Many other bills are also under
&gt;consideration.
&gt;
&gt;      It is also clear that the United States is fully
&gt;capable of enacting privacy laws to address public concern,
&gt;particularly when new technologies threaten personal
&gt;freedoms. In fact, we have passed several laws in a little
&gt;over a decade that specifically target new technologies.
&gt;Privacy protections for cable subscriber records were enacted
&gt;in 1984. Electronic mail was covered in 1986. Video rental
&gt;records gained protection in 1988. Even junk faxes and auto-
&gt;dialers became subject to privacy legislation in 1991.
&gt;
&gt;      So, we must observe at this point, that the view of
&gt;some that the United States does not support passage of
&gt;privacy legislation is not supported by the majority of
&gt;people of the United States, many of our elected officials,
&gt;or our recent history.
&gt;
&gt;      Much has been said in the last few months in support of
&gt;self-regulation. Self- regulation has been offered as a
&gt;privacy solution, a way to steer a course between government
&gt;control and free market chaos. It is critical to look closely
&gt;at the case for self-regulation.
&gt;
&gt;      First, it should be said that the current argument for
&gt;self-regulation is based on a preference and not a principle.
&gt;While much has been said about the "common philosophy" of the
&gt;Administration's policy toward the Internet, it is quite
&gt;clear, some would say painfully clear, that the
&gt;Administration is prepared to regulate if the interest at
&gt;stake is copyright or cryptography./1/
&gt;
&gt;      Second, self-regulation as an argument against privacy
&gt;protection is hardly new in the United States. The direct
&gt;marketing industry has argued for more than twenty years that
&gt;it did not need privacy regulation. The result is that today
&gt;Americans receive a flood of junkmail, more junkmail per
&gt;capita than any other country in the world. Millions of
&gt;Americans sign up for the Mail Preference Service to escape
&gt;this onslaught, but there is no assurance that the privacy of
&gt;these people will be protected. Professor Reidenberg and
&gt;Professor Schwartz have shown in their study of data
&gt;protection in the United States that the Mail Preference
&gt;Service is ignored by about half the members of the Direct
&gt;Marketing Association./2/
&gt;
&gt;      Self-regulation has also failed repeatedly in the last
&gt;few years as trade groups and individual companies have been
&gt;unwilling to uphold their own principles and their own
&gt;contractual agreements. In 1991 the Direct Marketing
&gt;Association failed to take action against the Lotus
&gt;Marketplace product even though it plainly violated the
&gt;industry's own guideline on the need to offer an effective
&gt;opt-out. Similarly, the DMA failed to take any action against
&gt;Metromail after the company turned a mailing list into a
&gt;look-up service in violation of another DMA edict. Companies
&gt;also appear unable to police themselves. America Online
&gt;entered into a deal with a telemarketing firm even after it
&gt;assured customers in its service agreement that it would not
&gt;disclose telephone numbers to others. There are many other
&gt;similar cases.
&gt;
&gt;      Consumer groups challenged these practices, and
&gt;eventually changes were made. But this is hardly proof, as
&gt;some proponents have claimed, that the self- regulatory
&gt;approach is working.
&gt;
&gt;      The advocates for self-regulation have also redefined
&gt;privacy in a way that is ultimately harmful to the interests
&gt;of consumers. Instead of focusing on the obligations of the
&gt;organizations that collect personal information to safeguard
&gt;the information and use it only for appropriate purposes, the
&gt;self-regulatory environment has produced numerous proposals
&gt;that all share the common goal of extracting as much
&gt;information from the individual as the individual can be
&gt;coerced to give up by means of contract. A typical
&gt;negotiation in an environment produced by P3 or OPS requires
&gt;consumers to satisfy the information disclosure requirements
&gt;of the business as a condition of gaining access to services.
&gt;
&gt;      As my colleague Professor Agre has observed, these
&gt;relationship easily become asymmetric with the organization
&gt;having the greater power to control what information about
&gt;itself is released while simultaneously obscuring the nature
&gt;and scope of the information it has obtained about
&gt;individuals.
&gt;
&gt;      Of course, one remains "free" to withhold consent and
&gt;to therefore be denied admission to a web site, service from
&gt;a web-based company, and many other opportunities in the
&gt;Information Society regardless of whether a fair
&gt;justification for the data collection is provided.
&gt;
&gt;      Simply stated, self-regulation elevates the principles
&gt;of notice and consent to stratospheric heights and ignores
&gt;virtually all other principles of privacy and data
&gt;protection. It is, to borrow from the British philosopher
&gt;Jeremy Bentham, "contracts on stilts."
&gt;
&gt;      This has been made clear by virtually all of the
&gt;proposals in the United States that focus on obtaining
&gt;consent. The most ironic of these was one recommendation
&gt;earnestly made by a government official on this issue of
&gt;children's privacy who proposed in place of legislative
&gt;safeguards the use of biometric identifiers to ensure that a
&gt;parent's consent to make use of a child's data for marketing
&gt;purposes had in fact been obtained.
&gt;
&gt;      Self-regulation has also given rise to the emphasis on
&gt;a multiplicity of privacy preferences. But whether
&gt;individuals actually have such diverse privacy preferences,
&gt;particularly in routine commercial transactions or in data
&gt;gathering activity remains to be seen. As Professor Agre
&gt;notes, "particular importance should be paid to uniformity of
&gt;protocols across different industries and applications, so
&gt;that consumers are not overwhelmed by a pointless diversity
&gt;of interfaces and contracts." /3/
&gt;
&gt;      He suggests that it will be particularly important to
&gt;look at a broad range of criteria, "including ease of
&gt;understanding, adequacy of notification, compliance with
&gt;standards, contractual fairness and enforceability,
&gt;appropriate choice of defaults, efficiency relative to the
&gt;potential benefits, and integration with other means of
&gt;privacy protection."
&gt;
&gt;      Self-regulation has a further problem: it provides a
&gt;very limited view of the problems surrounding privacy
&gt;protection. It focuses on the microeconomic relationship
&gt;between buyer and seller and ignores the larger social
&gt;questions of architecture and design. Should highway systems
&gt;be designed with anonymous toll payment ? Which technologies
&gt;could facilitate commerce and protect privacy ? What stand
&gt;should governments take on the use of cryptography ? Self-
&gt;regulation provides no answers to these questions, it
&gt;provides no mechanisms to find solutions.
&gt;
&gt;      Self-regulation have failed to work even in areas where
&gt;public and industry support is overwhelming. The Center for
&gt;Media Education found that more than a year after the release
&gt;of a widely publicized report on children's privacy that
&gt;companies were continuing to collect personally identifiable
&gt;information from children at their web sites without
&gt;disclosing how the information will be used, who will have
&gt;access to it, and without obtaining parental consent. As the
&gt;CME concluded, "it is clear that industry self-regulation
&gt;does not provide adequate protection for children's privacy."
&gt;
&gt;      It has been proposed that the Federal Trade Commission
&gt;could enforce a self- regulatory privacy regime by
&gt;prosecuting deceptive trade practices. But the FTC's ability
&gt;to actually enforce privacy protection in this manner is
&gt;highly suspect. First, the legal authority of the FTC under
&gt;section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act typically
&gt;requires a showing of &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; actual harm ~ to consumers. As those
&gt;who have studied privacy law in the United States know, this
&gt;will be a difficult test to satisfy. But even if this problem
&gt;is overcome, one could well ask why the FTC, if it had such
&gt;legal authority, pursued only one privacy case after two
&gt;years of intense privacy investigation. And in the single
&gt;case that the FTC investigated, the Commission issued an
&gt;opinion only after the company had discontinued the
&gt;challenged practice. There was no actual judgment against the
&gt;firm or any sanction imposed. Finally, what expectation can
&gt;there be that the FTC will pursue any privacy actions in the
&gt;near future when the Commissioner responsible for privacy
&gt;matters has now left the Commission ? One can look to the
&gt;Federal Trade Commission for the enforcement of privacy
&gt;safeguards on the Internet, but you will see only an empty
&gt;chair.
&gt;
&gt;      Finally, there is a significant legal objection to
&gt;self-regulation as a means to protect consumer privacy in the
&gt;United States: such an arrangement could be impermissible
&gt;under anti-trust law. It is, as one commentator has noted, a
&gt;violation of competition law for businesses in the same
&gt;market to combine to set the terms of competition and then to
&gt;enforce those terms on their competitors. Establishing
&gt;industry-wide privacy standards could have exactly this
&gt;consequence. Some commentators have suggested that it may be
&gt;possible for such agreements to survive anti-trust scrutiny
&gt;if the codes are sensibly designed and do not discourage
&gt;competition. But drafting such a policy may not be so simple.
&gt;
&gt;      What happens, for example, if industry adopts a code
&gt;based on an opt-out procedure and an innovative company,
&gt;recognizing the need for a higher privacy standard, prefers
&gt;to offer an opt-in procedure instead? If the industry
&gt;association discourages the company from offering the higher
&gt;standard, consumers would be harmed and an anti-trust action
&gt;could result. Indeed, there is already anecdotal evidence
&gt;that the marketing industry has engaged in just such
&gt;practices. (Note that in this example a regulatory framework
&gt;that established opt-out in law could still permit the
&gt;innovative company to offer the opt-in procedure.)
&gt;
&gt;      What we realize now is that self-regulation provides
&gt;neither the assurance of a legal right nor the innovation and
&gt;competitive benefit of the marketplace. It is simply an
&gt;answer to the question: how do we regulate without the
&gt;government ? This is not a path to privacy protection, it is
&gt;not even privacy policy.
&gt;
&gt;THE FUTURE
&gt;
&gt;      It seems to me surprising that we are unable today to
&gt;resolve the privacy differences between Europe and the United
&gt;States particularly as they concern the Internet. Both
&gt;regions share a high regard for privacy and a long privacy
&gt;tradition. Both regions seem eager for greater privacy
&gt;safeguards. We know also that there is a convergence in the
&gt;development of privacy standards around the globe./4/
&gt;
&gt;      But even more obviously, the Internet offers the ideal
&gt;environment to establish uniform standards to protect
&gt;personal privacy. This is clear to anyone who recognizes that
&gt;the platform is consistent around the globe, that the
&gt;protocols are consistent, and the customs surrounding
&gt;commercial transactions off-line are surprisingly consistent:
&gt;money buys products and services, the disclosure of one's
&gt;address is necessary to receive delivery of goods, and the
&gt;release of personal financial information may be necessary
&gt;when credit is sought.
&gt;
&gt;      For the vast majority of transactions on the Internet,
&gt;simple, predictable, uniform rules offer enormous benefits to
&gt;consumers and businesses. It is clear what the goal is.
&gt;
&gt;      We must find a way forward. The Commission would have
&gt;ample justification at this point if it decided to restrict
&gt;certain data flows to the United States because of the
&gt;absence of appropriate privacy safeguards. How can this point
&gt;be disputed? Consumers in the United States know that we lack
&gt;adequate privacy protection.
&gt;
&gt;       I think it is time to end what Colin Bennett has
&gt;called "American Exceptionalism.~ There is little support in
&gt;our public attitudes, law, or history for this stance. The
&gt;United States should move quickly to establish a privacy
&gt;agency, and then proceed to explore the application of the
&gt;OECD Privacy Guidelines to the private sector. This useful
&gt;framework provides a strong foundation for the development of
&gt;technical means to protect privacy and the development of new
&gt;privacy standards and legal safeguards. It is already found
&gt;today in several US privacy laws and in the practices of many
&gt;US companies.
&gt;
&gt;       I also propose today that the United States, Europe,
&gt;and Asia join together to develop an intentional convention
&gt;on privacy protection based on the OECD Guidelines. A simple
&gt;framework of general goals combined with a consultative
&gt;process that brings together a wide array of countries could
&gt;help ensure that privacy standards are extended to all comers
&gt;of the globe
&gt;
&gt;       Only when we have established privacy standards and
&gt;guidelines as strong as security standards and guidelines
&gt;will users of advanced networked services have the trust and
&gt;confidence to participate fully in the Information Society.
&gt;
&gt;       It is also my hope that in the process of working
&gt;together toward a common goal that some of the current
&gt;differences between the United States and Europe will
&gt;diminish. There is too much at stake for consumers, and
&gt;citizens, and users of the Internet to risk a clash of
&gt;privacy rules.
&gt;
&gt;       We share a common interest in the protection of
&gt;privacy. Let us go forward together and establish the
&gt;policies that will launch the information economies of the
&gt;next era while preserving the personal freedoms we cherish
&gt;today.
&gt;
&gt;       I thank you for your attention.
