&gt; PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
&gt; The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
&gt; Number 339  October 1, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
&gt; Stein
&gt; 
&gt; A NEW THEORY OF NMR FOR EXTENDED OBJECTS. 
&gt; Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) isn't just an imaging
&gt; technique, but a valuable spectroscopic tool for deducing the
&gt; chemical environment and structural layout of atoms in different
&gt; environments. This is because the NMR spectrum of an atom (or
&gt; to be more precise, the spectrum of the atom's nuclear magnetic
&gt; states) is different depending on the local geometry, just as an
&gt; atom's allowed electron energies will be different if the atom is
&gt; suddenly lodged in a crystal with many other atoms.  Previous
&gt; NMR theories have been able to explain accurately what the
&gt; NMR spectrum ought to be only for atoms or atom clusters in
&gt; isolation. Now, physicists at UC Berkeley (Steven Louie,
&gt; louie@jungle.berkeley.edu, 510-642-1709) have devised a
&gt; method which for the first time makes possible rigorous
&gt; calculations of the NMR spectra of extended systems such as
&gt; crystals, surfaces, polymers, or even amorphous materials; given
&gt; the coordinates of the atoms, the Berkeley researchers were able
&gt; to predict the spectrum. They tried out their theory on an
&gt; industrially important material---synthetic diamond films used,
&gt; for example, as coatings for tools and engine parts.  The
&gt; prediction of the NMR spectrum for carbon atoms in the diamond
&gt; films was in close agreement with the observed spectrum. 
&gt; (Francesco Mauri et al., Physical Review Letters, 22 Sept.
&gt; 1997.)

Hell of a way to reverse-engineer just about anything. How long you figure
it will be before they start coming out wit industrial units just for
materials analysis?  I wonder how good it would be at determing the layout
of a die through the carrier...

&gt; PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION WITH PROBE MICROSCOPY. 
&gt; Scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) provide pretty pictures of
&gt; atoms and can even be used to pluck single atoms from the
&gt; sample surface.  But often the identity of that atom (especially if
&gt; it is an impurity) remains unknown.  Physicists at Arizona State
&gt; (John Spence, Uwe Weierstall, weierstall@asu.edu) have
&gt; addressed this problem.  First, they use a small voltage to remove
&gt; a surface atom or molecule with an STM probe; then a larger
&gt; voltage launches the object from the probe toward a distant
&gt; detector.  A measurement of the time of flight (TOF) supplies a
&gt; mass-to-charge ratio for the mystery particle, which in most cases
&gt; will supply the identity of the unknown species. The best
&gt; resolution achieved by other methods of chemical identification
&gt; on surfaces is about 2 nm.  This new STM + TOF identification,
&gt; with essentially atomic-level resolution, should be handy in a
&gt; number of research areas, such as catalysis and the study of the
&gt; role of foreign atoms at kinks and steps in crystal growth.  This
&gt; work will be reported in a session (NS-TuA, Oct. 21) at the
&gt; upcoming meeting of the American Vacuum Society (Oct. 20-24
&gt; in San Jose). The program for this meeting can be viewed on the
&gt; Internet at this address:
&gt; www.vacuum.org/symposium/program.html.  (General press
&gt; contact at the meeting: 408-271-6000.)

Pretty nifty materials analysis tool. Maybe they should shoot the atom toward
the NMR...

&gt; FISSION HELPS SUPERCONDUCTIVITY.  One of the
&gt; problems of using high temperature superconductors as wires in
&gt; magnets is that the bundles of magnetic field lines that normally
&gt; stay put in the presence of low currents start to move around
&gt; (dissipating energy thereby) when larger currents are sent through
&gt; the wire sample. Scientists working at Los Alamos have now
&gt; used a proton beam to induce nuclear fission in mercury atoms in
&gt; a mercury/copper oxide superconductor.  The defects caused by
&gt; the fissioning atoms splay out in all directions in the
&gt; superconductor crystal and help to snag the wayward field lines.
&gt; This permits the sample to carry much more current.  (Nature, 18
&gt; Sept.)
