11 May 1905
<P>
Walking on the Marktgasse, one sees a wondrous sight. The cherries
in the fruit stalls sit aligned in rows, the hats in the millinery
shop are neatly stacked, the flowers on the balconies are arranged
in perfect symmetries, no crumbs lie on the bakery floor, no milk
is spilled on the cobblestones of the buttery. No thing is out
of place.
<P>
When a gay party leaves a restaurant, the tables are more tidy
than before. When a wind blows gently through the street, the
street is swept clean, the dirt and dust transported to the edge
of town. When waves of water splash against the shore, the shore
rebuilds itself. When leaves fall from the trees, the leaves line
up like birds in V-formation. When clouds form faces, the faces
stay. When a pipe lets smoke into a room, the soot drifts toward
a corner of the room, leaving clear air. Painted balconies exposed
to wind and rain become brighter in time. The sound of thunder
makes a broken vase reform itself, makes the fractured shards
leap up to the precise positions where they fit and bind. The
fragrant odor of a passing cinnamon cart intensifies, not dissipates,
with time.
<P>
Do these happenings seem strange?
<P>
In this world, the passage of time brings increasing order. Order
is the law of nature, the universal trend, the cosmic direction.
If time is an arrow, that arrow points toward order. The future
is pattern, organization, union, intensification; the past, randomness,
confusion, disintegration, dissipation.
<P>
Philosophers have argued that without a trend toward order, time
would lack meaning. The future would be indistinguishable from
the past. Sequences of events would be just so many random scenes
from a thousand novels. History would be indistinct, like the
mist slowly gathered by treetops in the evening.
<P>
In such a world, people with untidy houses lie in their beds and
wait for the forces of nature to jostle the dust from their windowsills
and straighten the shoes in their closets. People with untidy
affairs may picnic while their calendars become organized, their
appointments arranged, their accounts balanced. Lipsticks and
brushes and letters may be tossed into purses with the satisfaction
that they will sort themselves out automatically. Gardens need
never be pruned, weeds never uprooted. Desks become neat by the
end of the day. Clothes on the floor in the evening lie on chairs
in the morning. Missing socks reappear.<BR>
<P>
If one visits a city in the spring, one sees another wondrous
sight. For in springtime the populace becomes sick of the order
in their lives. In spring, people furiously lay waste to their
houses. They sweep in dirt, smash chairs, break windows. On Aarbergergasse,
or any residential avenue in sprint, one hears the sounds of broken
glass, shouting, howling, laughter. In spring, people meet at
unarranged times, burn their appointment books, throw away their
watches, drink through the night. This hysterical abandon continues
until summer, when people regain their senses and return to order.

In other words, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and
quacks like a duck&#133;it's probably a duck.<BR>
Reality is a Freudian slip.<BR>
<P>
InfoWar has been around since Adam and Eve gobbled down on the
fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
<P>
The fig leaf was the first cover-up. <I>&quot;Sorry, God, but
what's under there is Top Secret.&quot;</I>
<P>
Adam blamed Eve, Eve blamed the Serpent, and the Serpent blamed
his publicity department, fired six people, replaced them with
Spin Doctors, and went on to become President.
<P>
Figuratively speaking, of course.<BR>
<P>
Now all of the CypherPunks are sitting around slapping their foreheads
and saying:<BR>
Old Farts: &quot;I should have listened to Lenny Bruce.&quot;
<BR>
Middle Aged Farts: &quot;I should have listened to Bob Dylan.&quot;
<BR>
Young Farts: &quot;I should have listened to Marilyn Manson.&quot;
<BR>
Stupid Farts: &quot;I should have listened to TruthMonger.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
People you should have lynched, and now it's too late:<BR>
The person who named a nuclear missile, 'The PeaceKeeper.'<BR>
The President who let slip the words, 'New World Order.'<BR>
The first person to utter, &quot;What the President <B>meant</B>
to say, was&#133;&quot;<BR>
Everyone who said, &quot;I'm from the government, and I'm here
to <B>help</B> you.&quot;<BR>
&#133;ad infinitum&#133;<BR>
<P>
How many Nazi intelligence agents and rocket scientist were brought
into the US after World War II to work with the government and
large corporations?<BR>
Sorry, Top Secret.<BR>
How much biological and germ warfare research is being done with
your tax money?<BR>
Sorry, Top Secret.<BR>
How many foreign leaders, politicians, diplomats and business
men have been assassinated using your tax dollars?<BR>
Sorry, Top Secret.
<P>
Of course, now 'National Security' is the 'magic word.' (Or is
that 'magic <B>sword</B>?')
<P>
<I>&quot;Intelligence reports indicate that terrorists breathe&#133;&quot;
<BR>
</I>{Go ahead and extrapolate the preceding government statement
to its final conclusion. Don't forget the breathing tax that will
be necessary to cover the costs of the digital nose implants.}
<BR>
<P>
Your education wasn't 'free,' was it?<BR>
You had to pay for it by Pledging Allegiance every morning. You
had to pay for it by sitting up straight at your desk. You had
to pay for it by asking permission to pee. You had to pay for
it by making sure your desk was lined up straight with the others.
You had to pay for it by shutting the fuck up when you had a creative
thought, and hypnotically repeating back the lessons you were
taught. 
<P>
Who discovered America? And what the fuck were all of those goddamn
Indians doing there when it was 'discovered?' Fucking troublemakers&#133;
<BR>
<P>
Interactive. Doesn't that sound better than Corporate Message
Recovery? Better than Government Access to God-and-Everything?
<P>
The cynics make it all sound so dark and damning. All the Fascists
really want is to make certain that everyone is sitting up straight
in their seats&#133;that the seats are lined up properly&#133;that
no one forgets to pledge allegiance&#133;that you ask permission
before you pee&#133;<BR>
<P>
<I><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>&quot;THERE IS NO SECRET PLOT AGAINST
THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST!!!&quot;</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<I><FONT COLOR=#800000>We are here to <I><B>help</B> you&#133;
<BR>
Tim, sit up straight in your chair. Lucky, sit down, you can go
to the bathroom when I'm finished talking. Bill, Bill and William,
no more back-talk. Adam, apologize to PGP. Duncan, quit fidgeting.
Peter, have you been passing notes to TruthMonger, again? Blanc,
Mr. Gates will not be allowed to pick you up after class unless
he brings a note from your parents. Matthew and Phil, from now
on we will be using 3.0 as the value of pi, as per the new legislation.
Toto! Pull up your pants and leave that puppy alone.<BR>
Thank you for the apple, Kent. Would you like to lead the class
in pledging allegiance to PGP for Corporations?<BR>
</I></FONT></I>
<P>
When a US Armed Forces trained killer attacked a Federal Government
Building, who got the blame?<BR>
Citizens. Citizens with guns. Citizens with non-government guns.
The Paramilitary.
<P>
When a US Secret Intelligence Agency trained cryptographer attacks
a Federal Government Computer System, who will get the blame?
<BR>
Citizens. Citizens with crypto-munitions. Citizens with non-government
crypto-munitions. The CypherPunks.<BR>
<P>
Have you figured out what 'InfoWar' is, yet?
<P>
Cryptography is merely a battleground. Encryption is merely one
of the most dangerous weapons against the goals of InfoWar.
<P>
The War is over who will control Information.<BR>
The War is over who will control Words.<BR>
The War is over who will control Thoughts.<BR>
The War is over who will control Attention.<BR>
The War is over who will control Virtual Reality.<BR>
The War is over who will control WebWorld.
<P>
World War III is InfoWar!<BR>
<P>
Whoever controls Information, controls the Past.<BR>
<I>Oswald acted alone..</I>
<P>
Whoever controls Information, controls the Present.<BR>
<I> Gilmore acted alone.</I>
<P>
Whoever controls Information, controls the Future.<BR>
<I>Tim C. May acted alone&#133;<BR>
</I>
<P>
Repeat after me:
<P>
<I>&quot;Department of Defense secret agencies created the InterNet,
but they do not control and/or monitor all activity and communications
that take place on it.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;The government has shifted the focus of their engineers,
physicists and secret intelligence agencies from nuclear warfare
to information warfare, but they would not manipulate, destroy
and murder those who present a threat to their preeminence in
this arena of warfare.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;When the government's secret underground laboratories
reveal and share the technology of radar that can see through
solid walls, satellite cameras that can read the newspaper over
your shoulder, and tiny helicopters that can fit inside a peanut
shell, they are not in possession of even greater forms of clandestine
technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</I>Reality Check:<BR>
Why is strong encryption such a dangerous threat to the secret
and semi-secret agencies, committees and non-government bodies
who rule us from the shadows?<BR>
<I>It is because they <B>already</B> <B>have</B> the ability to
monitor all of our activities and communications. Widespread use
of strong encryption <B>threatens</B> that ability.<BR>
</I>
<P>
People who control technology and standards are on the inside.
People who make the chips that go into the computers and peripherals
are on the inside. People who supply the physical routes that
information travels over are on the inside.<BR>
People who use the above, are on the outside.
<P>
Arms for drugs, drugs for money-arms, drugs and money for favors
and information.
<P>
Our secret intelligence agencies tell our legislators that use
of strong crypto will interfere with their manipulation of the
electronic funds of the 'bad' individuals, corporations, and governments.
<BR>
Why did Colonel Olive North trade weapons and drugs to have the
hostages held until Ronnie RayGuns election and then released
on the day of his inauguration? Because weapons were what the
Iranians wanted.<BR>
What if the Iranians had wanted Sun Microsystems financially ruined
in return for the timed release of the hostages? Or Intel? Or
Tim C. May? (Who knows? Maybe the Tim C. Mayonnaise ASCII Art
is part of the Iran-Contra deal.)<BR>
<P>
Did the US Secret Intelligence Agencies support the development
and release of cryptography that they couldn't break, or didn't
have a backdoor to?<BR>
If so, then why was PGP such a threat to 'National Security?'
<P>
If the Men in Black don't already have ready access to information
hidden within current forms of encryption, then why would widespread
use of strong encryption be a threat?
<P>
Try this:<BR>
Go to a command line: type 'cd \PGP262' ; type 'pgp -kxa &quot;My
KeyID&quot; secring.pgp'<BR>
Send the output file to Louis J. Freeh, and ask him to please
not read your encrypted files.
<P>
Now:<BR>
Do the same thing, only dialing in to your machine from a friend's
machine.
<P>
Now:<BR>
Write a browser Java script that gets the secring.pgp file from
your machine via a web site.
<P>
Now: <BR>
Go home, kick your fucking door in, place a disk in the floppy
drive, and type 'pgp -kxa &quot;My KeyID&quot; a:\secring.asc
secring.pgp'.<BR>
Mail the disk to Louis J. Freeh<BR>
<P>
Does <B>your</B> copy of PGP ask for a password before spitting
out the KeyID to any one of a thousand monkeys who sits at your
keyboard and randomly types in the above?<BR>
<B>My</B> copy doesn't. 
<P>
Below is a copy of a key pulled off of my computer by 19 different
people. It was pulled off of my hard drive by the first individual,
who proceeded to inform a second individual of the method used,
and challenged them to do the same thing, using a different method.
The second did so, and passed all the information along to a third
person, etc., etc.<BR>
Nineteen people, nineteen different methods.

<P>
Are your 'secret' keys any more secure than mine?<BR>
Answer: If you send me a message encrypted to the key above, then
it doesn't really matter, does it? The end result is the same.
<P>
Strong crypto is not a threat.<BR>
<B>Widespread use</B> of strong crypto is a threat.
<P>
The Monitors cannot put the latest-greatest spy chip in every
computer, every printer, every modem. They cannot password-snarf
every system. They cannot compromise every remailer, every ISP,
every private network.<BR>
At present, they don't need to.<BR>
They can enter my house, and your house, and grab our keys. They
can't do so for everyone, but they don't need to, because everyone
isn't using strong crypto. They can monitor your keyboard and
mine, but they can't monitor everybody's. They can beat you and
I with rubber hoses, but they can't beat everyone with rubber
hoses (although they can dream&#133;).
<P>
The days of Judicial Safeguards are history.<BR>
There is no longer any need to go down to the local Teleco and
flash a warrant to get access to telephone conversations. The
Monitors own the satellites. Warrants are for when they are ready
to go to trial, and they want to do it by the book.<BR>
Hackers don't get warrants. Hackers don't need no stinking badges&#133;and
neither do secret intelligence agencies.<BR>
<P>
What is the problem with <B>widespread use</B> of strong crypto?
<BR>
It gets in the way of <B>immediate access</B> to data and communications.
<P>
If you understand nothing else about InfoWar, understand this:
<BR>
The Monitors <B>already have</B> access to almost all data and
communications. They are not attempting to get something they
don't have, they are trying to hold onto something that they already
have.
<P>
They can't kill a news story or editorial <B>after</B> it comes
out. They can't put genies back in the bottle <B>after</B> they
are released. Arranging for you to have an unfortunate accident
tomorrow doesn't erase the email you sent today.<BR>
<P>
Try this:<BR>
Get email accounts in the names of your children. Send messages
back and forth between them. Analyze the send and receive timing
of the Dr. Seus messages, as opposed to those of the 'Death Threat'
and 'Tim McVeigh' messages. <BR>
Do traceroutes to find out how the accounts travel via routes
to a variety of systems. Then send emails between the accounts
which threaten the lives of world leaders and various politicians.
Now do traceroutes and find out what routes the accounts travel.
<BR>
And remember, this is for your <B>children's</B> accounts.<BR>
<P>
The Monitors can get access to the keys of a thousand individuals
at a corporation, but this is unacceptable. They want access to
<B>one</B> key that allows them to access all of the thousand
individual's files and communications.<BR>
Their goals are quite simply to control and monitor information
as close to the source as possible. This is why they need 'Official'
news sources. 'Approved' websites. 'Authorized' encryption programs.
<BR>
This is why they give away billions of dollars of digital airwaves
to mainstream media. This is why they launch, and then settle,
anti-trust actions, lawsuits, financial and criminal investigations.
<BR>
<P>
NEWS FLASH!!!<BR>
Louis J. Freeh just discovered that he can ensure the institution
of GAK, CMR, and all manner of CRAP by killing <B>your</B> newborn
child.
<P>
Aren't you glad he's one of the 'good' guys?<BR>
<P>
Follow the Money!
<P>
Why do the Monitors want guaranteed access to all information
by 1999? Why are the Europeans planning to introduce a new form
of currency in 1999? What plans do the IRS have for 1999, when
it becomes obvious that many individuals, companies, and countries
do not have the capability to keep their bookwork from falling
into chaos?<BR>
Nothing? Right&#133;
<P>
The US has plans in place for invading Canada in the event that
there is a need to do so, but they have no plans in place for
financial and organizational chaos being created by the Year2000
Bug. Right&#133;
<P>
Governments, corporations, the rich and powerful&#133;none of
them have any plans in place to take advantage of any problems
that arise in society, in government, in financial empires, due
to the Y2K Bug. Right&#133;<BR>
 
<P>
The 'solutions' are already planned, and in place, waiting for
the problem. The solutions are pre-GAK'ed. The solutions have
eyes and ears.<BR>
Why is the IRS being 'rehabilitated' by Congressional investigation?
In preparation for 1999. Just as the FBI, the CIA, the DOJ, etc.,
have been 'rehabilitated.' Just as the government has been 'rehabilitated'
by the Freedom of Information Act, etc., while more and more power
is put into the hands of unelected committees, commissions and
semi-secret agencies.<BR>
<P>
InfoWar is being fought on the battlegrounds of Virtual Reality,
which are linked by the Information Highway. The armies are governmental
and corporate. The victor's prize, as always, is wealth and power.
<P>
On the battlefield of Encryption the war is over Access.
<P>
On the battlefield of Virtual Private Networks, the battle is
for Access.<BR>
<P>
The warplanes, ships, tanks, rockets and missiles&#133;the air,
sea and ground wars&#133;these are a dog-and-pony show for the
masses.<BR>
Just as the 'news' is for the masses.
<P>
When the Canadian Prime Minister is caught on audio-video calling
the US government criminals and thieves, this is news. This is
why he doesn't say those things into the microphone, except by
accident. It is not 'official' news, not 'managed' news, and it
will not be expanded upon for the general public.<BR>
The 'Official' news is 'Blah, blah, blah&#133;'
<P>
Even the 'Official' news isn't really 'official' when the governments
deny it.<BR>
The Israelis didn't <B>really</B> release a political prisoner
as a result of a deal to have their assassination team returned.
Canadian intelligence agencies don't <B>really</B> help the Mossad
obtain false Canadian passports in return for having their own
back scratched.<BR>
As long as they pretend they didn't really get caught, then they
can keep pretending that they don't do this type of thing all
of the time.<BR>
<P>
This is InfoWar&#133;<BR>
There are good pictures and bad pictures&#133;good words and bad
words&#133;good thoughts, ideas and beliefs, and bad ones.<BR>
The good people are here, where I am standing, and the bad people
are over there, where I am pointing.<BR>
My information is good information. Anything else is bad information.
<BR>
There are good URL's and bad URL's, good communications and bad
communications.
<P>
The Constitution needs to be explained to your children by those
who wrap themselves in the flag, not by those who burn the flag.

The Bill of Rights needs to be explained to your children by those

marihuana, even if they are doing so in a place where it is legal.

The Truth needs to be told to your children by those who the government
gives billions of dollars worth of the citizens' digital airwaves,
not by an armed forces veteran who is telling his story on his
