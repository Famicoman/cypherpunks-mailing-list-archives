----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              WORK AND NOT WORK

Looking back over the events of my life since I wrote Witness and the
experience of the Institute Summer School of 1962; it becomes more than ever
clear to me that our understanding of man turns upon the problem of Reality.
If the aim of existence is Self-Realization and if this is identical with
God-Realization, then the connecting link that makes them one and the same
is to be found in the meaning of the word 'Reality'. If all were equally
real, then realization means the process of transformation that leads from
the unreality or imperfect reality towards Reality in the fullest sense.

The theme of this book is that there are both degrees and distinctive modes
of Reality, and that there is a process that leads from the Unreal to the
Real. This, in its turn, requires that there should be a means of effecting
the transformation. This 'means' is what we call by the name of WORK. In the
book there are few references to Work, either in the absolute sense as the
process of universal realization, or in the relative sense of personal
transformation. This is because those who participated in the discussions
started from the premise that Work is a reality in both senses: absolute and
relative. We were not concerned to discuss the authenticity of the process
of transformation, but to understand it better.

The obligation to work for Reality is the Categorical Imperative from which
life derives its meaning. It is, as Kant showed in the Grundlage, the
ultimate, irreducible, moral certainty from which are derived our notions of
God, Immortality and Ethic. I have never been satisfied, nor I believe was
Kant himself, with the Critique of Practical Reason. It does not convey the
sense of urgency which we experience in contemplating life based on Work and
life without Work.

I was impelled to write this Epilogue by the impact of a vision or vivid
dream that woke me from sleep a few nights ago.

I found myself in some remote, antipodean place where people were living
ordinary lives. I recognized not a few of them as people I knew or had read
about and noticed with a sense of wonder rather than surprise that some were
still living and others were dead. They did not notice this difference
because in any case they were all ghosts. But they were all aware of being
ghosts and wanted to turn into real people. From time to time, an aeroplane
arrived with others who joined them and among the new arrivals were both
living ghosts and dead ghosts. I was made aware that all was well with these
people because eventually they would cease to be ghosts.

Then I found myself back again nearer home; but this time I was taken to
some kind of underground place. Here also were people more or less happily
occupied with their daily lives and some of them were now living and others
were dead. These also were ghosts but these ghosts were neither able to
distinguish between life and death, nor did they understand that they were
no more than ghosts.

I knew that I must tell them about their condition and about the other place
where ghosts were being transformed into real beings. When I spoke to them
of aeroplanes that could take them over, they said that they would go only
if an aeroplane would come back and assure them that there was a place for
them over there.

I remember very clearly explaining that once an aeroplane had gone over, it
would never return. This seemed to them illogical and unreasonable and they
took no more notice of what I said.

Then I found myself in a kind of lift being taken back to the surface. I
looked at the lift-man and said to myself, "If I were not colour blind I
should see that his face is grey". Somehow, this observation brought home to
me the terror of being a ghost and immense pity filled me for these people
who had lost the possibility of becoming real.

As I began to wake up, I said to myself: "What does it really matter that
they are only ghosts? They are good, decent people, living good, decent
lives and if they are satisfied with unreality why should they be disturbed?
Their ghostly existence is also necessary."

At that moment I awakened completely and saw, in a flash, the infinite
significance of Work. It is the imperative of all imperatives, the source
from which all life takes its meaning, the way to Reality and even Reality
itself. Work takes many forms: but all forms have one common character: the
Will to Reality. Whether active or passive, whether in solitude or in
society, work is always one and the same: it is the dedication of the will
to the realization of Reality. This dedication carries with it the
obligation to share understanding with others and to serve the Work in its
universal significance. That is why those who have seen the difference
between ghost-life and real-life are compelled to speak of what they have
seen-even to those who do not wish to hear.

I am more than ever aware of the imperfections and even the errors in what I
have written. I am ashamed to offer it as a "Spiritual Psychology" to those
who are seeking for the Reality that is Work. Let it be taken as an essay
and an attempt to share an understanding that is still in the process of
being born.

        "He who shits on the road, will meet flies upon his return."

What is InfoWar?

InfoWar is the voice that tells you that you can shit on the road, and not
meet flies upon your return, if you spray the area with Agent Orange.
InfoWar is the voice that tells you that you can spray the area with Agent
Orange and not suffer any consequences to your own health, because you don't
live here.
InfoWar is the voice that tells you the people who do live here are
Communists who need to be killed, with the help of Agent Orange, and people
who need to be saved from both the Communists and the flies, with the help
of Agent Orange.

InfoWar is when the evening movie at the PX is 'Clockwork Orange' and your
head starts pounding, as a ferocious battle begins between your awakened
prenascence and the thundering voice which is screaming, "It is not
synchronicity…it is only a coincidence."

InfoWar is when you can look at a picture of a napalm-burned child and tell
by the color of their skin whether or not they are the enemy.

I am not arguing for or against this or that battle, this or that war. I am
only pointing out that anyone who returns from war the same as when they
left for war, or with their sanity completely intact, in need of no healing…
Well, let me just say that they already live in a Virtual Reality within
which the inhabitants of that reality do not realize that they are ghosts.

InfoWar is when you don't turn on the gas…you only put them in the ovens.
InfoWar is when you don't put them in the ovens…you only turn on the gas.

InfoWar is when you don't drop the atomic bomb, you only design it.
InfoWar is when you have two types of nuclear bombs and you convince
yourself that they both need to be dropped, not for testing purposes, but to
end the war earlier, and to save lives.
InfoWar is going to sleep praying that your Generals and Nuclear Physicists
don't wake you in the morning to tell you that they have developed a third
type of nuclear bomb, which must be dropped in order to shorten the war and
save lives…or a fourth, or a fifth.

InfoWar is convincing you to develop nuclear software without a backdoor
that you can use to prevent it from raining destruction on the innocent,
because you are just a programmer, an engineer, a designer, a grunt, and
these types of decisions are to be made by those who are trained to know
when it is right for millions upon millions of people to die, and for the
earth to be scorched beyond repair.

InfoWar is convincing you to design surveillance software without a
mechanism available to defeat it if it falls into the hands of the
Destroyer.
InfoWar is thinking that you are an island, and that your island only
produces the tools and weapons that can be used for great Good or great
Evil-thinking that those on other islands bear the responsibility for how
those tools and weapons are used.

that ye were our countrymen." -- Samuel Adams
