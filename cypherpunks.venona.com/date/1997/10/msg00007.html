ten months ago: on or about 961218:1123 
    "Timothy C. May" &lt;tcmay@got.net&gt; purported to expostulate:

+_Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state through
+the spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax
+system, through even more direct applications of the right tools at the
+right times.
+
+When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.

    [Tim] said this before Christmas last year as an erudite and lengthy
    addendum to my lengthy tome: "Cypherpunks as Philosophy Kings" 
    that pretty well summed our generally mutually agreed "philosophy". 

    both were and still are worth reading; anybody who does not have
    copies, ask.

    but cypherpunk terrorists are not violent; this is all about making
    information free and protecting privacy with technology.

    despite the fact the Commerce Committee effectively killed SAFE
    (or we think they did until Oxley tries to tack his amendment
    structure on an appropriations bill in a house-senate conference or
    "manager's mark" procedure (whatever that is)), we can not drop the 
    due diligence, and the public must be aroused, called to battle. 
    even if there is no action, prepare for the next fire drill. sow the
    seeds of dissension.

    seems to me we were sure the CDA was dead --except it slipped in with 
    a manager's mark after the house voted almost unanimously the other
    way (402-12 or something like that). the capitol hill sleeze 
    took a grand slam NO and reported an even worse yes, making it part
    of a major bill that absolutely was going to pass --and they 
    have the gall to call that travesty democracy?  Teddy Roosevelt: 

        "It is difficult to make our material condition better by the 
        best law, but it is easy enough to ruin it by bad laws."

    Tim's message for Christmas last was the prophetic call for direct
    action; legal action; empowerment action: Robert H. Jackson
    (1892-1954), U.S. Judge:

        "It is not the function of our Government to keep the citizen 
        from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to
        keep the Government from falling into error."

    CYPHERPUNKS MUST BE THE JOHNNY APPLESEED OF THE INFORMATION AGE.

    the sleezeball, who intends to make J Edger look like a piker at 
    surveillance, has the gleam of unabridged power in his eyes. Louis 
    F[reeh,uck] is charming, even disarming, as he tells a Congressional
    committee:

        "We are potentially the most dangerous agency in the 
        country if we are not scrutinized carefully." (Jun '97)

    meaning the FBI will be the most powerful [feared] federal agency?
    really?  I thought it was already, although the DEA and BATF have 
    worked hard for the title, too.

    Supreme Justice Louis O. Brandeis said:
    
        "The greatest danger to liberty lurks in insidious encroachment 
        by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding."

    and the [London] Electronic Telegraph, on Sunday's front page:

        Mr Freeh has won $370 million (ú230 million) of
        funding for 2,000 new posts, boosted the number of
        active agents to more than 11,000, and expanded
        open-ended "domestic security operations" from 100 in
        1995 to more than 800.  Twenty-three new FBI offices
        are opening abroad.

    and more:

        But none of this will contain the director's ambitions
        or his power.  He is now believed to be eyeing two
        other "secret police" forces - the Drug Enforcement
        Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
        - with a long-term view to a takeover.

    F[reeh,uck] holds the key to the Clintons' ambitions; the Clintons 
    cite the Roosevelts as their mentors; Hillary even communes with the
    long dead Eleanor. Bubba's stated goals included extending FDR's 
    "chicken in every pot" --he's just appeasing the crowd now.

    Leopards do not change their spots, but Bubba has shifted to the 
    right with public opinion; he is just like the leopard: playing with
    his food until sufficient presidential powers have been accumulated 
    by the default of Congress and the people.

    But, the INFORMATION REVOLUTION now stands in way of the Clinton
    plans; the Internet can destroy the media control now exercised by
    the acquiescence of the five jewish media barons. In fact, it is 
    destroying their monopoly.

        THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION IS THE CONTROL OF POWER. 

    Why does F[reeh,uck] hold the key?  Because his job is to sell the 
    Congress on strangling the information revolution before it destroys
    truthless governments F[reeh,uck]'s masters understand and control.

    Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated on 4 Mar 33 stating:

        "I am prepared under my constitutional duty to 
        recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the
        midst of a stricken world may require.  These
        measures, or such other measures as the Congress may
        build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall
        seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring
        to speedy adoption.  But in the event that the
        Congress shall fall to take one of these two 
        courses, and in the event that the national
        emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the
        clear course of duty that will then confront me.  I
        shall ask the Congress for the one remaining
        instrument to meet the crisis broad Executive power
        to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the
        power that would be given to me if we were in fact
        invaded by a foreign foe."

    and, on 9 Mar 33, 5 days later, FDR extracted from an uniformed
    and essentially special session of Congress:

        "Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of
        the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the
        Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists and
        that it is imperatively necessary speedily to put into effect
        remedies of uniform national application."

    which was based on the War Powers Act (trading with the Enemy) of
    1917 which was hastily revised to include US Citizens which had been
    exempted. Next, FDR "franchised" the banks, "licensed" agriculture
    and so on. But, to render the citizens powerless and to confiscate
    all assets so the national state was the ultimate owner, and
    therefore able to pledge the people for credit to the international
    bankers, the fundamental monetary system changed:

        "Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, such action is necessary to protect the 
        currency system of the United States, the Secretary 
        of the Treasury, in his discretion, may require any 
        or all individuals, partnerships, associations and 
        corporations to pay and deliver to the Treasurer 
        of the United States any or all gold coin, gold
        bullion, and gold certificates owned by such 
        individuals, partnerships, associations and 
        corporations." 

    which closed the loop and made every US citizen chattel as FDR 
    pledged the good faith and credit of the United States to the 
    international bankers --in return, an unbelievable flood of credit 
    was available since the good faith and credit of the United States 
    is "We the People...."  but FDR sold us downstream into a debt 
    financed economy from which there is no escape; we are still there,
    the debt service is destroying any permanent economy AND total
    collapse under the debt load is bequeathed to our children.

    Congress repealed FDR's rubber stamp for the "President" in 1973,
    but the War Powers Act remains, still modified to treat US 
    citizens as the enemy. and the power of the "President" to make 
    those regulations, and the automatic approval are enshrined for
    current and future Presidents in Title 12 USC 95(b)

        "The actions, regulations, rules, licenses, orders and 
        proclamations heretofore or hereafter taken, promulgated, made,
        or issued by the President of the United States or the Secretary
        of the Treasury since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to the
        authority conferred by subdivision (b) of Section 5 of the Act
        of October 6, 1917, as amended, are hereby approved and
        confirmed."

    The real issue is the President and the fat cat power brokers can 
    get away with these shenanigans __as_long_as_the_people_let_them__.
    We are still under the Rule of Necessity. We are still in a declared
    state of national emergency, a state of emergency which has existed,
    uninterrupted, since 1933.  

    FDR's licensing agencies were rather trivial in number; today there 
    are thousands of them, many with their own administrative courts. 
    FDR took away our common law when he bankrupted America, which is a 
    national corporation under the Hague convention (courtesy of Stanton
    and Seward after the Civil War).  Bankruptcy is a contract, and 
    we are the bait, subject to that court, which is in effect an 
    Admiralty court, and we are "licensed" to literally exist by FDR's 
    Social Security Number schema. and every courtroom now flies the 
    fringed Admiralty flag where habeas corpus is a privilege, not a 
    right, if it exists at all.

    This is the importance of Louis F[reeh,uck].  He, and Janet Reno as 
    the DOJ rubber stamp, are holding the collar for your neck. They
    are selling it to you little by little, or even all at once.

    Why Louis F[reeh,uck]?  Madison Avenue style with credentials; he
    can sell the program. F[reeh,uck] is the front man, the schill.

    Machiavelli, in his "Discourses of Livy," acknowledged that great 
    power may have to be given to the Executive if the State is to
    survive, but warned of great dangers in doing so.  He cautioned: 

        Nor is it sufficient if this power be conferred 
        upon good men; for men are frail, and easily 
        corrupted, and then in a short time, he that is 
        absolute may easily corrupt the people."

    sleezeball's comments are scarfed by Congress, sleezeball's candor
    rocks their cradles, sleezeball shows them private morality plays
    about a populace running wild with crypto-anarchy, running wild 
    to burn out the offices of central power...  in other words:

      DEPRIVE THEM CONGRESSCRITTERS OF THEIR FREE LUNCH AND IMMUNITY.

    is it not odd that the more the government tries to abridge our free
    speech rights, the more they want to confiscate our weapons?

        free speech is a weapon of democracy!
        privacy is a weapon of democracy!
        cryptography is a weapon of democracy!

    We are not fighting with guns and explosives this time, armed 
    insurrection against the power of the Federal government is 
    suicidal --we are fighting for our lives and the right to live our
    lives with words: the ability to hear those words _before_
    government censors and spin doctors render them useless lies.

    Bubba can not win a war of truth and information; we can/

    The Marquis de Sade:

        Are not laws dangerous which inhibit the passions? 
        Compare the centuries of anarchy with those of the 
        strongest legalism in any country you like and you will
        see that it is only when the laws are silent that the
        greatest actions appear.

    however, anarchy is the key word that ignites even the ACLU against
    your cause; it even makes makes bedfellows of Pat Buchanann and the
    homosexual/priest/congressman from Massachusetts...  

    pure anarchy, by definition, does not work, anyway. forget it. get 
    the concept out of your systems as it inflames everyone and all 
    other reason is lost in the screaming and police batons.  

    Even Teddy Roosevelt called for the complete extermination of
    anarchists, to be hunted like vermin. give it up; or go to your
    private island and fly your rattlesnake flag. even Anguilla will not
    tolerate anarchists.

    just give us our REAL constitutional rights as Franklin, Madison, 
    Jefferson, Adams, and friends intended; give us constitutionalists 
    on the Supreme Court, not bleeding hearts, statists, and central
    power freaks. get the Feds out of cradle to grave big government and
    let the people determine their religion and morality.

    give us freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms, freedom from 
    unreasonable searches, freedom not to incriminate ourselves, and 
    repeal the 14th Amendment so we can have states' rights again.

    if our Constitution were permitted to govern as it was intended, and 
    the states obeyed the precepts endowed to not further limit the
    rights of the people, America would be the home of the free, not big
    government, not freeloaders and the welfare state; not the leftovers
    of a once great nation.

    give us the rights Abraham Lincoln cherished lovingly:

     "Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves."

    let _them_, not me, live the downside.

    George Washington, in his farewell address, warned:

       "... change by usurpation; for through this, 
        in one instance, may be the instrument of good, 
        it is the customary weapon by which free 
        governments are destroyed."

    cypherpunk philosopher kings: pick up your picks and shovels, get 
    your hands dirty, and start digging in; it's going to be a long and 
    difficult campaign and the tactics needed to expose F[reeh,uck]'s
    true intentions as the schill for the Clintons who are schills
    for the elitist leading the destruction of American democracy. 

    The Congressional compromise love match season isn't over yet; the
    schmoozers and lobbyists, like so many furry rats, still wander the
    dark halls and tunnels looking for the last, late in the season,
    clandestine and obscene fuck.  any whore will do.

    lobbyists have long reputations for selling out the interests of
    their paymasters; the lobbyists are so much a part of the Washington
    culture that they have _no_ morality or moral position --it is all
    about who they can claim to have influenced --what difference does
    it make if it is contrary to the client --the art of the deal, 
    protect their own position and find newer, richer clients --whores!
    logrolling and porkbarrel voting --but never go home without a deal;
    used car salesmanship: get your man.

    I can hear the lobbyists whining now as they are called on the 
    carpet:

        "aw, come on Mac, we got you a compromise from LEA demands..."

    never realizing that there is such an action as NO bill, they sell 
    out half our rights blocking legislation which would never happen.

    they claim they got back half. what half? --some unknown half that 
    we _never_ lost!  that is why:

        The 10 Commandments contain 297 words. The Bill of Rights is 
        stated in 463 words. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains 266
        words; and: 

        A recent federal directive to regulate the price of cabbage
        contains 26,911 words. (The Atlanta Journal)

    send the quisling Neville Chamberlains to the gas chambers!

    the public needs to be educated, not in crypto, but in the horrors of     
    an oligarchy which intends to destroy the fundamental freedoms on 
    which we stand.  

    publish his credit records; publish his medical records --tell his
    neighbors about his visits from Child Protective Services... then
    Joe Coach Potato will figure out he needs something

        AFTER he figures out there are fuckors and fuckees, 
        and he's on the short end of that stick. [pardon my French]

    then, and only then, will the masses understand privacy --when they 
    have lost it. 

    either we show the people before they lose everything to uncle,
    or...    just dump it on the table to show everyone just how much
    uncle knows about _you_.

    Attila's thought for the day:

      Now, with a black jack mule you wish to harness, you walk up, 
      look him in the eye, and hit him with a 2X4 over the left eye.   
      If he blinks, hit him over the right eye! He'll cooperate.  
          --so will politicians.

    Louis F]reeh,uck], did you really state this hoping everyone would 
    think you are joking? 

        "We are potentially the most dangerous agency in the 
        country if we are not scrutinized carefully."

    Louis F[reeh,uck], you obviously know that telling the truth, before 
    the truth is really the truth, disarms your opposition since they 
    can plainly see that it is not true.

    there is a limit to what you can endure before you must stand to 
    be counted --so I will loudly echo Tim's sentiment: 
+
+When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.
+
 --
 "Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other."     
        --Benjamin Franklin
