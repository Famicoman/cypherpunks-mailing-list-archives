&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now email is a confounding medium because it is both a transient
&gt;&gt; communication medium and a storage medium.  We would like to be able to
&gt;&gt; have protection against losing access to our stored data, at the same time
&gt;&gt; we are sure that those who violate our trust and intercept our
&gt;&gt; communications can not read the data, when it is sent or at any time in the
&gt;&gt; future.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; PGP 5.5 seems to have a solution to the "lose your data" problem.  It does
&gt;&gt; not seem to address the secure deletion problem.

&gt;If PGP wants to archive data sent or received, well they can do so, but
&gt;sending encrypted communications over open networks encrypted to _two_
&gt;long term public keys is bad security practice.


&gt;There are two reasons which are given as to why someone might want to
&gt;have GAK installed for company use.

&gt;1. to allow access to important material lost in the mail system in the
&gt;event that an employee is hit by a bus

&gt;2. to allow management to spot check the emails being sent and received


&gt;Argument 1 seems pretty flimsy to me.  I reiterate my comment in an
&gt;earlier post: who in their right mind keeps their _only_ copy of ultra
&gt;valuable company information bouncing around in the email system?  Did
&gt;those arguing for this position not notice that sometimes email gets lost
&gt;in transit?

Well lets take the flip side of this: Who in their right mind encrypts
ultra valuable company information and then leaves the plain text on their
computer?? I have an outbox full of encrypted messages that are encrypted
to both the recipient and to my key (Encrypt-To-Self Option). If you are
going through the trouble of encryption why would you want to leave plain
text lying around??? One needs to remember that e-mail is not just
communication but communication *and* storage.

&gt;Regardless, if PGP claims to be catering to those who use this argument,
&gt;and to not want to try that hard to make it impossible to by-pass, the
&gt;more secure, and less GAK friendly way to do it is to have the mail
&gt;client software archive the email sent and received.

I have to disagree, see above.

&gt;Argument 2 I find somewhat distasteful, but seems to me to be logically
&gt;what PGP's implementation is catering for.  A less GAK friendly way to
&gt;implement it, and a more secure (communications secure, not saying
&gt;anything about GAK being easier or harder to by-pass) way would be to
&gt;archive for a while the session keys. The security advantage being that
&gt;the email doesn't go out with the session key encrypted to 2 long term
&gt;public key encryption keys.

I have seen no evidence that encrypting to multiple recipients is any less
secure than encrypting to one. If there are serious security implications
in doing so then it affects *all* versions of PGP and not just 5.5. I find
it odd that this issue is only now being brought up with 5.5 and never
mentioned with previous versions.

One thing I would like to see added to this set-up is secret sharing of
the corporate private key. That way one person could not unilaterally
access the data but would require the agreement of several people (say 3
of 5 department heads). I think this would provide enhanced physical
security of the key and personal privacy (Joe in IMS can't snoop the mail
just because he is board). I have made some mention of this in the past to
PGP but don't know what if any work has been done in this area. I have
been working on a small utility that would let a user do this with his own
private key. Perhaps if I ever get some free time I can finish it up.
