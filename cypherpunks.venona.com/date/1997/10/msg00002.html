Illinois Police Standoff Enters Sixth Day

   CHICAGO (Reuter) - A standoff between Illinois state police and a
   51-year-old widow in southern Illinois entered its sixth day Saturday
   with negotiations continuing but no progress seen, the police said.
   
   Sgt. Flynn Hanners of the Illinois State Police said negotiators have
   been contacting Shirley Ann Allen every 15 to 20 minutes to try to get
   her out of her house in Roby, about 15 miles east of the state capital
   Springfield.
   
   The standoff began Monday when Christian County sheriff's deputies and
   a family member attempted to serve court-ordered commitment papers for
   a psychological exam on Allen, he said.
   
   "Our whole design behind this is to get her out of the house and get
   her the medical attention she needs because she obviously has some
   mental illness that needs to be treated," Hanners said.
   
   He added that the police have been in constant contact with Allen's
   family and doctors and that a psychologist who works with the state
   police has been at the scene.
   
   Hanners said no activity has been seen since Friday morning when Allen
   fired a 12-gauge shotgun at officers and negotiators after the
   officers had fired six 12-gauge bean bag rounds at her, striking her
   three times.
   
   The officers fired after Allen left the house, faced the negotiators
   who were in plain view and raised the shotgun "as if to fire," he
   said.
   
   "Three of the six rounds struck her in the chest area, the midsection,
   but she was not stunned," he said. The bean bag shots are designed to
   knock someone to the ground, but Hanners said the shots had no effect
   on Allen, probably because of the number of layers of clothing she was
   wearing.
   
   Allen also fired at the police Tuesday when two officers has gotten
   close to the house "trying to get a look in," Hanners said. He added
   that power had been cut to the house temporarily Tuesday.
