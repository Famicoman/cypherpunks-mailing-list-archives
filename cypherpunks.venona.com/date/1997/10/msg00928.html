&gt;                  FBI HIRES NUCLEAR PHYSICIST TO HEAD CRIME LAB
&gt;      Web posted at: 2:27 p.m. EDT (1827 GMT)
&gt;      From Correspondent Terry Frieden
&gt; 
&gt;      WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI hired the former head of a government
&gt;      nuclear weapons laboratory to direct its troubled crime lab, even
&gt;      though he has no background in forensic science.
...
&gt;      the man chosen for the post is Donald M. Kerr Jr., 58, a
&gt;      physicist-engineer who from 1979 to 1985 headed the government's Los
&gt;      Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed.

Of course, this comes as no surprise to those who follow the 'Chronicles
of InfoWar,' since we have long been aware that the secret government 
long ago declared 'information' to be 'munitions.'
How long until we hear the official announcement that *all* information
will need to be 'registered,' in the interests of National Security, and
to protect the citizens from the 2,000,000 Horses of the Apocalypse?
(Including, no doubt, terroists with 'suitcases' full of 'information.')

&gt;      "It just seems dumbfounding and implausible that they would not hire
&gt;      a world-class forensic scientist to take over the crime lab," center
&gt;      Director Stephen Kohn said.
&gt; 
&gt;      The selection also was criticized by the National Association of
&gt;      Criminal Defense Lawyers.
&gt; 
&gt;      "Once again, the FBI has dealt with Congress and the public with
&gt;      incredible arrogance," said the group's vice president, William
&gt;      Moffitt.

  Is this supposed to come as a 'surprise'?

&gt;      Kris Kolesnik, senior counselor to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
&gt;      one of the harshest critics of the FBI, said Kerr's work at Los
&gt;      Alamos and more recently for a major defense contractor make him a
&gt;      "real government insider."

  His experience and track-record also make him a perfect choice for
revitalizing the FBI's ability to cover up their mistakes, keeping
their dirty little secrets out of the hands of the public.

&gt;      Meanwhile, another flap over the crime lab erupted Friday when chief
&gt;      lab whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst said that in examining FBI lab
&gt;      reports recently released under the Freedom of Information Act, he
&gt;      found that five more FBI examiners had altered lab reports.
&gt; 
&gt;      "In the last week, I have found five more people that have been
&gt;      altering cases -- five more that the inspector general didn't find,"
&gt;      Whitehurst said.

  Whitehust, who will die in a tragic car-accident later this year,
will soon be exposed as a drug-addicted, godless-commie pedophile.
