<CENTER><B>WORK AND NOT WORK</B></CENTER>
<P>
Looking back over the events of my life since I wrote <I>Witness
</I>and the experience of the Institute Summer School of 1962;
it becomes more than ever clear to me that our understanding of
man turns upon the problem of Reality. If the aim of existence
is Self-Realization and if this is identical with God-Realization,
then the connecting link that makes them one and the same is to
be found in the meaning of the word 'Reality'. If all were equally
real, then realization means the process of transformation that
leads from the unreality or imperfect reality towards Reality
in the fullest sense.
<P>
The theme of this book is that there are both degrees and distinctive
modes of Reality, and that there is a process that leads from
the Unreal to the Real. This, in its turn, requires that there
should be a means of effecting the transformation. This 'means'
is what we call by the name of WORK. In the book there are few
references to Work, either in the absolute sense as the process
of universal realization, or in the relative sense of personal
transformation. This is because those who participated in the
discussions started from the premise that Work is a reality in
both senses: absolute and relative. We were not concerned to discuss
the authenticity of the process of transformation, but to understand
it better.
<P>
The obligation to work for Reality is the Categorical Imperative
from which life derives its meaning. It is, as Kant showed in
the Grundlage, the ultimate, irreducible, moral certainty from
which are derived our notions of God, Immortality and Ethic. I
have never been satisfied, nor I believe was Kant himself, with
the Critique of Practical Reason. It does not convey the sense
of urgency which we experience in contemplating life based on
Work and life without Work.
<P>
I was impelled to write this Epilogue by the impact of a vision
or vivid dream that woke me from sleep a few nights ago.
<P>
I found myself in some remote, antipodean place where people were
living ordinary lives. I recognized not a few of them as people
I knew or had read about and noticed with a sense of wonder rather
than surprise that some were still living and others were dead.
They did not notice this difference because in any case they were
all ghosts. But they were all aware of being ghosts and wanted
to turn into real people. From time to time, an aeroplane arrived
with others who joined them and among the new arrivals were both
living ghosts and dead ghosts. I was made aware that all was well
with these people because eventually they would cease to be ghosts.
<P>
Then I found myself back again nearer home; but this time I was
taken to some kind of underground place. Here also were people
more or less happily occupied with their daily lives and some
of them were now living and others were dead. These also were
ghosts but these ghosts were neither able to distinguish between
life and death, nor did they understand that they were no more
than ghosts.
<P>
I knew that I must tell them about their condition and about the
other place where ghosts were being transformed into real beings.
When I spoke to them of aeroplanes that could take them over,
they said that they would go only if an aeroplane would come back
and assure them that there was a place for them over there.
<P>
I remember very clearly explaining that once an aeroplane had
gone over, it would never return. This seemed to them illogical
and unreasonable and they took no more notice of what I said.
<P>
Then I found myself in a kind of lift being taken back to the
surface. I looked at the lift-man and said to myself, <I>&quot;If
I were not colour blind I should see that his face is grey&quot;.
</I>Somehow, this observation brought home to me the terror of
being a ghost and immense pity filled me for these people who
had lost the possibility of becoming real.
<P>
As I began to wake up, I said to myself: <I>&quot;What does it
really matter that they are only ghosts? They are good, decent
people, living good, decent lives and if they are satisfied with
unreality why should they be disturbed? Their ghostly existence
is also necessary.&quot;</I>
<P>
At that moment I awakened completely and saw, in a flash, the
infinite significance of Work. It is the imperative of all imperatives,
the source from which all life takes its meaning, the way to Reality
and even Reality itself. Work takes many forms: but all forms
have one common character: the <I>Will to Reality</I>. Whether
active or passive, whether in solitude or in society, work is
always one and the same: it is the dedication of the will to the
realization of Reality. This dedication carries with it the obligation
to <I>share</I> understanding with others and to <I>serve</I>
the Work in its universal significance. That is why those who
have seen the difference between ghost-life and real-life are
compelled to speak of what they have seen-even to those who do
not wish to hear.
<P>
I am more than ever aware of the imperfections and even the errors
in what I have written. I am ashamed to offer it as a &quot;Spiritual
Psychology&quot; to those who are seeking for the Reality that
is Work. Let it be taken as an essay and an attempt to share an
understanding that is still in the process of being born.

<FONT COLOR=#000000>InfoWar is the voice that tells you that you

InfoWar is the voice that tells you that you can spray the area
with Agent Orange and <B>not</B> suffer any consequences to your

InfoWar is the voice that tells you the people who <B>do</B> live
here are Communists who need to be killed, with the help of Agent
Orange, and people who need to be saved from both the Communists
and the flies, with the help of Agent Orange.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>InfoWar is when the evening movie at the PX
is <I>'Clockwork Orange'</I> and your head starts pounding, as
a ferocious battle begins between your awakened prenascence and
the thundering voice which is screaming, <I>&quot;It is <B>not</B>
synchronicity&#133;it is only a coincidence.&quot;</I></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>I am not arguing for or against this or that
battle, this or that war. I am only pointing out that anyone who
returns from war the same as when they left for war, or with their
sanity completely intact, in need of no healing&#133;<BR>

within which the inhabitants of that reality do not realize that
they are ghosts.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>InfoWar is when you don't drop the atomic
bomb, you only design it.<BR>
InfoWar is when you have two types of nuclear bombs and you convince
yourself that they <B>both</B> need to be dropped, not for testing
purposes, but to end the war earlier, and to save lives.<BR>
InfoWar is going to sleep praying that your Generals and Nuclear
Physicists don't wake you in the morning to tell you that they
have developed a <B>third</B> type of nuclear bomb, which must
be dropped in order to shorten the war and save lives&#133;or
a fourth, or a fifth.<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>InfoWar is convincing you to develop nuclear
software without a backdoor that you can use to prevent it from
raining destruction on the innocent, because you are just a programmer,
an engineer, a designer, a grunt, and these types of decisions
are to be made by those who are trained to know when it is <B>right</B>
for millions upon millions of people to die, and for the earth
to be scorched beyond repair.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>InfoWar is convincing you to design surveillance
software without a mechanism available to defeat it if it falls
into the hands of the Destroyer.<BR>
InfoWar is thinking that you are an island, and that your island
only produces the tools and weapons that can be used for great
Good or great Evil-thinking that those on other islands bear the
<B>responsibility</B> for how those tools and weapons are used.</FONT>
