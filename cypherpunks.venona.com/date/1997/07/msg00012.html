                     The only convention with free beer!

 IN SHORT:--------------------------------------------------------------------

         WHAT: Speakers and partying in Vegas for all hackers
         WHEN: July 11th - 13th
         WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ the Aladdin Hotel and Casino
         COSTS: $30 in advance, $40 at the door
         MORE INFO: <A  HREF="http://www.defcon.org">http://www.defcon.org</A> or email info@defcon.org

 IN LONG:---------------------------------------------------------------------

 It's time to brave Las Vegas again for DEF CON!  This is an initial
 announcement and invitation to DEF CON V, a convention for the "underground"
 elements of the computer culture.  We try to target the (Fill in your
 favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies, Virii Coders, Programmers,
 Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties Groups, CypherPunks,
 Futurists, Artists, Criminally Insane, Hearing Impaired.  It seems that
 books about the culture are becoming more popular, so of course reporters
 are also welcome.  You won't be hurt.  I promise.  Just bring cash for
 drinks.

 So you heard about DEF CON IV, and want to hit part V?  You heard about the
 parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
 check it out in person?  You want to do weird shit _away_ from the hotel
 where you can't get me in trouble?  You have intimate knowledge of the SWIFT
 network, and want to transfer millions of dollars to the Def Con account?
 Then you're just the person to attend!

 What DEF CON is known for is the open discussion of all ideas, the free
 environment to make new contacts and the lack of ego.  More people have made
 great friends at DEF CON over the years than my brain can conceive of.  DEF
 CON is also known for letting the "Suits" (Government / Corporate) mix with
 everyone and get an idea of what the scene is all about.  The media makes an
 appearance every year and we try to educate them as to what is really going
 on.  Basically it has turned into the place to be if you are at all
 interested in the computer underground.

 [Note]-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Now last year over 800 people showed up and threw my whole program for a
 loop.  I was thinking 500+ people, but when 800 showed up it got a little
 crazy for the planning staff.  This year I am planning for 1,000.  This
 way I will be able to accommodate everyone and have less logistical screw-
 ups.

 I would also like to apologize to everyone last year who had temporary
 badges for half the convention, etc.  I will do all that is possible for
 maximum coolness, and minimum hassles.   Anyway, enough of my shit, on with
 the details.

 [End Note]-------------------------------------------------------------------

 SPEAKERS:--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Over the years DEF CON has had many notable speakers.  This year there will
 be more of an emphasis on technical talks.  There will be a separate smaller
 room for break-out sessions of more specific topics.  While the talks of the
 past have been great, it always seems some tech people drop out and general
 talks fill in.  I will load it tech heavy so when people do drop out there
 will still be plenty of meat left for the propeller heads.

 There will be some speaking on Friday evening before Hacker Jeopardy, all
 day Saturday and Sunday.  About 20 people will speak, plus smaller tech
 sessions.  If you are interested in speaking or demonstrating something
 please contact me.

 Current speakers include:

 [&gt; Nhil - Windows NT (in)security.  The challenge response system, NT 5.0
    Kerb security services, man in the middle attacks on domain controllers.
    This will be a more technical discussion of NT related security.

 [&gt; Yobie - Emerging infrastructures made possible by Java.  He will describe
    and talk about Java as the foundation for a global, object-oriented
    distributed network.  New concepts and computing paradigms will discussed
    as well as applications for both applications development or straight-out
    hacking.

 [&gt; Mudge - System Administrator for L0pht Heavy Industries.  He will present
    a technical talk on something cool.

 [&gt; Clovis - From the Hacker Jeopardy winning team.  He will discuss issues
    with security and networked object systems, looking at some of the
    recent security issues found with activeX and detail some of the
    potentials and problems with network objects. Topics will include
    development of objects, distributed objects, standards, ActiveX, corba,
    and hacking objects.

 [&gt; Wrangler - Packet Sniffing:  He will define the idea, explain everything
    from 802.2 frames down to the TCP datagram, and explain the mechanisms
    (NIT, bpf) that different platforms provide to allow the hack.

    Wrangler has been programming since seven column paper tape.  He is a
    loner with the social skills of a California Condor.  He has never been
    a member of LOD, MOD, or any other group.  He has written no books, is
    not currently employed, and refuses to discuss what he refers to as "that
    credit card provider thing back when I used to do mainframe shit."   His
    current projects include looking for his next Fortune 100 contract and
    writing the DEFCON V virus.

 EVENTS:----------------------------------------------------------------------

 [&gt;     HACKER JEOPARDY:

        Winn is back with Hacker Jeopardy!!  The third year in the running!
        Can the all-powerful Strat and his crypto-minion Erik, whose force
        cannot be contained, be defeated?!  Will the powers that be allow
        Strat-Meister to dominate this beloved event for the third year in
        a row?!  Can Erik continue to pimp-slap the audience into submission
        with a spoon in his mouth?!?  Only Skill, Time, and booze will tell
        the tail!

        The Holy Cow will help supply the beer, you supply the answers.
        The first round starts at 12 midnight o'clock on Friday and lasts
        until it is done.  The second and secret rounds will happen Saturday
        at midnight.

        6 teams will be picked at random and compete for the final round.
        There can be only one!  Strat's Team, the winners from last year
        will defend if all the members can be found.

 [&gt;     FREE BEER!

        Holy Cow will provide free beer tickets!  If you are over 21 prepare
        to consume "hacker" beers.  Actually it's whatever beer they have on
        tap, but it's the best beer in Las Vegas.  Follow Las Vegas Blvd. up
        until you see the florescent cow with the big sunglasses.  All taxi
        drivers know of this Mecca.  Over 1,000 free beers in all!

 [&gt;     BLACK AND WHITE BALL:

        We've talked it over, and the verdict is in.  For the last two years
        at DEF CON there has been a sort of unspoken Saturday night dress up
        event.  People have worn everything from party dresses and Tuxedoes
        to AJ's ultra pimp Swank outfit with tiger print kilt.  This year it
        is official.  Wear your cool shit Saturday night, be it gothic or PVC
        vinyl or Yakuza looking black MIBs.  No prizes, just your chance to
        be the uber-bustah pimp.

 [&gt;     THE TCP/IP DRINKING GAME:

        If you don't know the rules, you'll figure 'em out.

 [&gt;     CAPTURE THE FLAG:


                  ALL NEW, ALL IMPROVED, MORE CONFRONTATIONAL,
                         1997 ILLUMINATI INVITATIONAL,
                        CAPTURE THE FLAG, HACKER STYLE.

      The goal is to take over everybody else's server while protecting your
      own. To cut down on lag time and federal offences we're providing a
      playing field of 5 flag-machine networks connected by a big router in
      the middle.

      The rules:

      1) No taking the network down for more than 60 seconds.
      2) No taking any flag machine (including your own) down for more than
         3 minutes.
      3) In order to be counted in the game, a team's flag machine must
         - be directly connected to the network;
         - have a text file flag on the machine readable by at least 2
           accounts,
         - keep at least 3 *normal* services running in a way that a
           client could actually get their work done using them.       
         - run a web server if technically possible.
      4) No goonery/summoning of elder gods/Mickey Finns/physical
         coercion... you get the idea.  ( You had the idea, but we're
         trying to prevent you from using it. )


      The field of play :
      Each network will have a "server" of some kind on it, called the flag
      machine. At the start of the game, these servers will be stock
      installations a lot like what you'd see on the average academic/secret
      cabal/military/megacorp  network. Each of these machines  will have a
      PGP private key, named root.flag, and a web server.

      There will also be a machine to provide DNS, called the scoreboard.

      Teams:
      Teams can be one human or more. In order to be a team, you have
      to generate 20 256bit PGP key pairs, have a DEFCON goon pgp-sign
      them and put the public keys on the scoreboard webserver. We'll
      generate a hundred key pairs in advance, so the first five teams can
      just grab a floppy disk (if they're trusting).

      To prove that you've hacked a flag machine, PGP - sign a message with
      the root.flag from the hacked machine, then with one of your own.
      Post the doubly-signed message on the scorekeeper  web server, and
      you've captured that flag (and invalidated the captured root.flag).

      When you've captured a flag, decide between conquest and
      condescension: either take over the server yourself, or hand it back
      to its not-so-eleet owners. To conquer, put one of your PGP private
      keys on the captured server to become the next root.flag.  (Of
      course, you have to properly secure the server to maintain your new
      territory.)

      To condescend, just wait until the original owners see their shame
      spread across the scoreboard. (It would sure be a pity if
      they had to put up a new key before they figured out how you got in
      last time, wouldn't it?)

      Two Ways to Win:

      #1 EVIL EMPIRE: Whoever has the most servers responding with their
         teams' private keys at the end wins.

      #2 PIRATE: Fabulous prizes will also be given to whoever racks up the
         highest total number of flags captured.

      Rough game mechanics (why is everyone so untrusting?):
      Once every 5 minutes or more, the scoreboard machine will post a
      plaintext challenge.  Every team that claims to own a server has to
      PGP-sign that challenge with the private key registered for that
      server and post the signed version on their machine. If a server
      can't respond within 3 minutes, then nobody owns it, and it's fair
      game to be taken back over by the goons.

      Specific rules will be available in print at DefCon before the game
      begins.

 [&gt;     QUAKE COMPETITION:

        <A  HREF="http://www.ctive.com/ntech/defcon.htm">http://www.ctive.com/ntech/defcon.htm</A>

        This year knightPhlight contacted me and wanted to organize a single
        elimination Quake competition to find out who that badest ass 'mo 'fo
        is.  Check out the web site to get the rules, sign up, or to
        donate a computer the greater good of destruction.

        It is IMHO that Quake by id Software rules 3D action gaming. But who
        rules Quake?  We'll find out this July 11th-13th at the DefCon
        Conference in Las Vegas. This isn't going to be a networked game
        intent on quickly eliminating as many players as possible in a single
        round. Rather, one-on-one games will be played to absolutely
        determine who the best really is.

        Of course, you already know your the best so why would you feel
        obligated to prove it? Because we'll give the first place winner
        $750. Now, being the wily person you are, I bet you would like to
        know where I got the money for the prizes. It'll come from your
        registration fee of $7.50.  Any half wit can do the math and see the
        10,000% return for the winner. But just for entering you'll be in a
        drawing for really kewl stuff. If you don't think its kewl you can
        just give us your email address and we'll be happy to send you a
        couple hundred thousand messages explaining why the prizes are great.

        Web Server
        CU-reflector
        RealAudio Server
        IRC server?

        This year we are pre-building many of the network boxes so the net
        can go up first thing Friday.  It looks like we will have a T1 line
        and we will break it out to 10 BaseT hubs.  If you want in on the
        network bring along the appropriate cables and adapters.

        More Net Madness!  The T1 bandwidth will allow us to do the
        following cool stuff:

        - Have several color quickcams and a CU-SeeMe reflector site set
        up so people not at the con can check out what's going on.  During
        the convention check out the DEF CON web site to get the location
        of the reflector site.  You should get and install the software
        needed to view CU-SeeMe streams in advance!

        - Have a RealAudio server set up to stream the speakers talks to
        those who can not attend.

        - Potentially play a competitive multi user game(s) over the net.

        NOTE!  If you wish to participate interactively with the convention
        please e-mail me and we can coordinate something.  It would be
        great to get people from all over the world involved.

        The ever popular paranoia builder.  Who IS that person next to you?

        "Like a paranoid version of pin the tail on the donkey, the
        favorite sport at this gathering of computer hackers and phone
        phreaks seems to be hunting down real and imagined telephone
        security and Federal and local law enforcement authorities who the
        attendees are certain are tracking their every move.. .. Of course,
        they may be right."
                                                        - John Markhoff, NYT

        Basically the contest goes like this:  If you see some shady MIB
        (Men in Black) earphone penny loafer sunglass wearing Clint Eastwood
        to live and die in LA type lurking about, point him out.  Just get
        my attention and claim out loud you think you have spotted a fed.
        The people around at the time will then (I bet) start to discuss the
        possibility of whether or not a real fed has been spotted.  Once
        enough people have decided that a fed has been spotted, and the
        Identified Fed (I.F.) has had a say, and informal vote takes place,
        and if enough people think it's a true fed, or fed wanna-be, or
        other nefarious style character, you win a "I spotted the fed!"
        shirt, and the I.F. gets an "I am the fed!" shirt.

        NOTE TO THE FEDS:  This is all in good fun, and if you survive
        unmolested and undetected, but would still secretly like an "I am
        the fed!" shirt to wear around the office or when booting in doors,
        please contact me when no one is looking and I will take your
        order(s).  Just think of all the looks of awe you'll generate at
        work wearing this shirt while you file away all the paperwork
        you'll have to produce over this convention.  I won't turn in any
        feds who contact me, they have to be spotted by others.

        DOUBLE SECRET NOTE TO FEDS:  This year I am printing up extra "I
        am the Fed!" shirts, and will be trading them for coffee mugs,
        shirts or baseball hats from your favorite TLA.  If you want to
        swap bring along some goodies and we can trade.  Be stealth about
        it if you don't want people to spot you.  Agents from foreign
        governments are welcome to trade too, but I gotta work on my mug
        collection and this is the fastest way.

 [&gt;     RAIL GUN DEMONSTRATION: (Friday)

        On Friday afternoon there will be a demonstration of a hand held
        rail gun.  This garage project should be able to fire a graphite
        washer very, very fast.

 [&gt;     OMNIDIRECTIONAL CELL PHONE JAMMER DEMONSTRAITON: (Friday)

        Another interesting creation to be tested on Friday in the desert.
        Come along and watch you cell phone antenna explode with power!
        See control channels crumble before you.

 [&gt;     RADIO BURST CANNON DEMONSTRATION: (Friday)

        While not quite a HERF gun, this should come close.  The RBC should
        be able to produce up to or less than one MegaWatt for up to or less
        than one second.  What will this do?  Who knows!  Come and find out.
        Obviously the above demonstrations will take place away from the
        local hospitals and casinos out in the desert someplace, so be
        prepared.

  [&gt;     DEF CON Voice Bridge (801) 855-3326

         This is a multi-line voice bbs, VMB and voice conference system.
         There are 5 or so conference areas, with up to eight people on each
         one.  Anyone can create a free VMB, and there are different voice
         bbs sections for separate topics.  This is a good neutral meeting
         place to hook up with others.

         The Voice bridge will be changing numbers soon, but the old number
         will refer you to the new location.  The new spot won't suffer from

 DO YOU WANT TO HELP?---------------------------------------------------------

         Here is what you can do if you want to help out or participate in
         some way:

         Donate stuff for the continuous giveaways and the various contests.
         Got extra ancient stuff, or new cool stuff you don't use anymore?
         Donate it to a good cause!  One person was very happy over winning
         an osborne "portable" computer.

         ORGANIZE sharing a room or rides with other people in your area.
         Join the mailing list and let people know you have floor space or
         some extra seats in your car.  Hey, what's the worst that can
         happen besides a trashed hotel room or a car-jacking?

         CREATE questions for hacker jeopardy (you know how the game is
         played) and email them to winn@infowar.com.  No one helped out last
         year, so this year let's try.  Everything from "Famous narks" to
         "unix bugs" is fair game.

         BRING a machine with a 10bt interface card, and get on the local
         network, trade pgp signatures, etc.

 FINAL CHECK LIST OF STUFF TO BRING:------------------------------------------

         From: Enigma

          Here is a list of items to bring to DefCon.  These are only
         suggestions.  Your mileage may vary.  :)

         Items to bring to DefCon
         ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~
         Clothing
         - Comfortable shirts and pants/shorts
         - Socks, underwear, etc
         - Bathing suit
         - Toiletries (deodorant, toothbrush, comb, hair spray,..., giant
           tub of hair grease, Oxy pads, etc)
         - An extra towel (don't leave home without it.  Anyway, doesn't
           it always seem that you run out of clean towels in the
           bathroom?)
         - Something cool, hip, pimp-o-matic, or ninja-riffic to wear
           Saturday night at the Black and White Ball
           You can skip the deodorant and extra clothing if all you are going
           to do is play "Magic: The Gathering" and "Quake."  Everyone else
           does.

         Stuph
         - Your shades.  Vegas is hot.  The sun is bright.  'Nuff said.
           (If you wear eye glasses, I hear the clip-on, flip-up sunglasses
           are quite the fashion statement)
         - Sunscreen of at least SPF 100.  After spending hundreds of hours
           in front of the monitor, who needs the sun to ruin their ghostly
           white tan?
         - A hat--preferably with a cool logo or catchy phrase like "Gandalf
           Routers," "Netscape," "Microsoft [with "sucks" scrawled below it
           in permanent marker]", "I [heart] [insert government institution:
           Cops, Feds, etc]"...you get the idea
         - Note book, palmtop, or laptop to take notes on during the speeches
         - [Micro]casette recorder to record the speeches (or everyone
           getting drunk in your room Saturday night, not knowing what they
           are saying, with no hope of remembering it...excellent blackmail
           material!)
         - Camcorder (see above...&lt;&gt;)
         - Digital camera--for all of the above reasons PLUS you can
           instantly upload the images through the T1 onto the net
         - Fake ID for all of you under 18/21
         - Fake ID for everyone else, if you're planning something illegal
         - Your best jokes (Nooooo!  Not the superman joke!  Not the pink
           joke)
         - Your best hacking stories...these are all about something "your
           friend" did, aren't they?  You wouldn't admit to doing anything
           illegal, now, would you?
         - Someone else's--oops, I mean "your" credit card numbers

         Fun
         - Your drug(s) of choice -- From caffeine to pot to speed to acid
         - Zippo and extra fuel.  And while you're at it, put an extra flint
           (assuming you can find one in the back of your junk drawer) in
           the bottom.  You always run out at just the wrong time.
         - Extra smokez (Splurge: get some cigars or cloves for the weekend)
         - Leather
         - Handcuffs and chains, nipple clamps, etc.
         - Saran wrap, duct tape, electrical tape, gaffer's tape
         - Candles (the drippy kind)
         - Incense
         - Oils
         - Your copy of "The Pocket Kama Sutra" (ISBN 0-7894-0437-0)
         - That corn starch and water "slime" that Light Ray (I believe) and
           others believed to be the ultimate thing, several DefCon's back.

         Tech
         - Laptop w/ Ethernet card
         - Extra laptop battery
         - A zip drive with a stack of disks containing all your soooper
           k-rad haxing utilities and g-files
         - 10bt/10b2 cabling
         - A small hub
         - You did remember to put a packet sniffer on your zip disk, right?
           Just checking.
         - Every power cord you could possibly need
         - A serial cable with a plethora of adapters so you can get each
           end to be male/female, 9pin/25pin, null-modem/straight
         - Cable to connect the above mentioned digital camera to the laptop
         - Scanner (modded, of course)
         - Frequency counter (I hear the "Scout" is pretty good)
         - HAM radio.  Any band, any frequency.  You didn't modify it to
           transmit on arbitrary frequencies, did you?  Naughty monkey!
         - An assortment of tuned antennas
         - That zip disk has the FCC frequency allocations on it, right?
         - Your uber-elite organizer (the DOS based HP palmtops are quite
           cool) to collect handles and email addresses from people
         - High energy weapons ("Is that an unlicensed nuclear accelerator
           on your back?"  "No, it's just a HERF gun."  "Oh.")
         - Laser pointer (don't get kicked out of the hotel again, youz
           doodz)
         - Your "white courtesy phone" that you stole from the Monte Carlo
           last year
         - A microbroadcasting station with plenty of tuneage
         - Your lock picks or lock picking gun
         - A pocket-sized tool kit containing a modular screwdriver and
           plenty of attachments (flathead, philips, torx, hex, etc)
         - A pocket knife, pliers and wire cutters--or alternatively a
           Leatherman's tool
         - Hell, while you're at it: why not some bring bolt cutters, a
           sledge hammer, and a hack saw?
         - Telephone handset with alligator clips.  Or, if you're uber-
           31337, you have a lineman's butt set (with the serial number
           and telco logo filed off)
         - Bubble gum or epoxy putty--anything maleable and hardens.
           This is good for fixing hoses under the hood of your car.
           It's also useful to jam mechanical sensors (What would happen
           if the microwave always though it's door was open?  Or if the
           elevator always thought there was someone blocking the path
           of the door?  Wouldn't hotel security be pissed if they
           couldn't get into their security room because someone jammed
           a toothpick into the keyhole with krazy glue?)
         - An alabi
         - Spam
         - Multimeter
         - Cordless electric soldering iron
         - Parts box
