Why should we be "defenseless against them"?

Why should we be "defenseless" against those who plot crimes behind locked
doors, with curtains drawn? Why not simply enter at will?

And why be "defenseless" against those who speak in whispers, or those who
speak in languages the State and Defense Departments have no translators
for? Imprison the Navajo code talkers for speaking in an unapproved
language.

And why should the State be defenseless against those like Winston Smith
who keep illegal, unescrowed diaries? They might be plotting to move
nuclear weapons.

&gt;don't think the keys should be in the hands of federal law enforcement
&gt;agencies who have demonstrably screwed up big-time on an anwful lot of
&gt;occasions.  Judges -- people like the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals --
&gt;would look rather askance at requests for someone's key when it was no
&gt;more aggravating an issue than a piece of flame mail.  On the other hand,
&gt;if someone's going to blow up San Francisco this week, it sure would help
&gt;to have a key to any encrypted communications he was generating.  Of course,
&gt;a lot of people would like to see it blow up, and maybe Tim is one of
&gt;those, too.

&gt;Best,


Fuck you with all your "best" bullshit. You are the enemy.

My keys are my keys, period. If any Ninth Circuit stooge wants them, he'll
have to deal with my (illegal by their bullshit laws) AR-15.

You, of course, are quite welcome to voluntarily "escrow" your crypto keys,
your house keys, your car keys, and the codes to your diary with the local
or circuit judge of your choice. Just don't volunteer _my_ keys.

Got it?

Vermin like you are what is wrong with this country, and the reasons the
militias are gaining strength every day. A fucking house-cleaning is in
order.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
