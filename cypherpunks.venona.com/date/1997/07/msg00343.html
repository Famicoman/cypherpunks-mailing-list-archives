Jim Choate, realizing that he finally had solid evidence as to
the true identity of the coward hiding behind the TruthMonger
persona, forwarded to the list:

&gt;             OPEN MICROPHONE CATCHES CHRETIEN'S CRITICISM OF CLINTON
&gt;      From Senior White House Correspondent Wolf Blitzer
&gt; 
&gt;      Apparently unaware the microphone in front of him was on, Chretien
&gt;      bragged that his country does not let the United States dictate its
&gt;      policy, and suggested American politicians make decisions solely for
&gt;      reasons of expediency.
&gt; 
&gt;      "In your country, in my country, all the politicians would be in
&gt;      prison because they sell their votes," Chretien said.

  Spoken like a TruthMonger!
  I always had my suspicions that the main person using the TruthMonger
multi-user persona on the CypherPunks list was acting out of some kind
of obsessive, guilt-driven psychosis as a form of repentance for great
evils being commited under his true identity.

  Chretien, as Prime Minister of Canada, has to live with the knowledge
that in order for his country to survive he needs to kowtow to a gang
of criminals in a neighboring country who have the firepower to smoke
the Canadians' butts in a heartbeat.
  The TruthMonger posts are more sporadic when Chretien is involved in
international conferences, and it is now obvious that the pressure of
living a lie builds up and spills out at these times when he cannot
relieve himself of his guilt using his TruthMonger posts.

  I suspect that Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is Rabid Wombat
and Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker is masquerading on
the list as Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM.
  The CypherPunks list is the one place where they can let their hair
down and tell Big Brother Bill and the whole goddamn world what they
really think.

&gt;      He also said Clinton was in favor of inviting Poland, Hungary and
&gt;      the Czech Republic to join NATO because it would woo voters.
&gt; 
&gt;      Speaking in French, the Canadian prime minister said: "It's not
&gt;      reasons of state. It's all done for short-term political reasons, to
&gt;      win elections. Take the quarrel over whether to admit the Baltic
&gt;      states. That has noting to do with world security. It's because in
&gt;      Chicago, Mayor (Richard M.) Daley controls lots of votes for the
&gt;      nomination."

  Or, as Chretian would have put it, as TruthMonger, "Big Brother Bill
is a lying, Nazi, sack of shit whose main concern in regard to world
security is his ability to use it to suck Daley's big vote-cock."
 
&gt;      The three leaders laughed as they waited for the Clinton and his
&gt;      advisers to arrive for the meeting.

  True CypherPunks, they are laughing their asses off that "we the
sheeple" let these charlatans and criminals rob and oppress us under
the guise of democracy.
 
&gt; He (Chretien), he's used to not doing
&gt;      what they want," Juncker said.
&gt; 
&gt;      "I make it my policy," Chretien said. "But it's popular. The Cuba
&gt;      affair. I was the first to stand up" against it U.S. policy
&gt;      tightening the economic embargo on Cuba.

  Unfortunately, he didn't have the political balls to testify for the
defense in the Timothy McVeigh trial, so he had to express his support
for McVeigh as TruthMonger.

&gt;      The three leaders chuckled among themselves.

  What the fuck is wrong with the American people?
  Here are three world-leaders who openly acknowledge that the U.S. is
in the hands of gangsters who would be imprisoned for crimes against
the citizens and the country if justice truly prevailed in America. And
a single conversation, accidentally(?) revealed such as this one, is no
doubt just the smallest of samples of the stinking rot that lies at the
heart of a gang of criminals who are actively working to subvert the
constitution of the country in the interests of furthering their ever-
tightening, fascist grip on the reins of power.

  The same government which trained Timothy McVeigh to kill (and then
fucked over his Desert Storm compatriots when their service to their
country cost them their health) used their trained, "it's all there in
the press release" news dogs to turn their own penny-ante hired gun
into a "monster" symbolizing patriotic paramilitarists whose concern
lies with defending America at home rather than murdering foreigners
for "votes."
  Slipping in the polls because you murdered and fucked over too many
of your own citizens? Whack out a pile of worthless foreigners with
high-tech weapons that allow us to slaughter them wholesale without
losing any American lives. Watch your poll stats rise as Americans stand
and cheer the murder of defeated, retreating troops by aircraft missles
which weren't designed to take prisoners.
  Act surprised when 800 government law enforcement agents with the 
latest in technology claim to be unable to prevent men, women and 
children that were victims of a botched government assault from dying
a horrible, burning death. Act outraged when the chickens come home to
roost in Oklahoma City.

&gt;      "In your country, in my country, all the politicians would be in
&gt;      prison because they sell their votes," Chretien said.

  The reason they are not in prison here is because they are armed
and dangerous and have managed to disarm and disenfranchise their
citizens, making any resistance to government fascism a criminal 
offense.
  We get to vote for the criminal of our choice from among the
group of criminals that the other criminals pre-select for us
and whose campaigns they support with our stolen booty.
  If a "ringer" slips through, such as Kennedy, he is murdered
and the criminals make a great show of patriotic mourning. If
a no-name schill is foisted on the public as vice-president,like
Agnew, and will take power because the "gang leader" is getting busted,
remove him on the basis of what are "parking tickets" compared to the
crimes of most of your cronies.

  World-leaders recognize that the American citizen is just a stupid
'mark' who is getting fucked in a sophisticated con by men who have no
qualms about stealing senior citizen's life savings (Social Security)
stealing votes and elections (bribery, sabotage and power mongering),
and stealing the rights and freedoms of the citizens by lying about
the need to stop illegal drugs (which remain freely available no matter
how many of our rights and freedoms are stripped).

  I don't have a death-wish of any sort, but if I happen to get killed
by someone striking back at the enemies of freedom who are usurping the
constitution to tighten their criminal control over the citizens, then
I can think of far worse reasons to die.
  We lose 169 people every time a bean-counter decides it's cheaper to
pay off the families of the dead instead of spending an extra nickle
on every seat-belt installation in an automobile. We lose 169 people
every time some Senator decides we need a new weapons system instead
of new hospitals or medical services. We lose 169 people every time
the President decides to stomp on the citizen's rights instead of
giving them enough freedom to feel like they can face life without
numbing their senses to the stench around them with ever-increasing
amounts of narcotics.

  Gambling is a government-regulated criminal enterprise, now, and
Timothy McVeigh's ante was just to establish that the citizens are in
the game. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some heavy betting 
taking place from all the players who choose to "sit in."
  American sheeple may regard McVeigh as a "monster," but world-leaders
make a strong case for viewing him as a "crime-fighter."
