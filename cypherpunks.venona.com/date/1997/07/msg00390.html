&gt; &gt;Hmmm.  I thought the basis was completely different.  I thought the
&gt; &gt;deal was between legal officials of various states who were mounting
&gt; &gt;suits against the tobacco companies, and the tobacco companies.  That
&gt; &gt;is, it is essentially an "out of court" settlement of a civil lawsuit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As such, it would indeed not be binding on Tim May's Tobacco Co.  And
&gt; &gt;there are no particular constitutional issues involved, or free speech
&gt; &gt;issues, either, come to think of it -- the settlement is just between
&gt; &gt;the parties of a civil suit.
&gt; 
&gt; The agreement halts future lawsuits, thus depriving those who have not yet
&gt; sued, or even those who have not yet contemplated suing, from seeking
&gt; redress in the courts.

I don't think it is correct that the deal halts future lawsuits from 
other parties, only from the signers of the deal.

&gt; This would seem to be a rather major constitutional issue.

Not really.  It would just be unconstitutional, and almost certainly
thrown out.  I don't think the lawyers involved are that stupid.  By
getting the major tobacco companies to an essentially private
agreement they have achieved their goals -- it would be silly to
depend on a fickle, money-hungry congress to pass some laws to enforce
it. 

&gt; It's also unclear whether the "agreement" covers tobacco companies not even
&gt; extant at this time (hence my use of the "Tim's Tobacco Company" example,
&gt; where TTC is incorporated in 1998 and begins advertising with Joe
&gt; Camel-type ads. Several states attorneys general have opinined that the
&gt; deal means a complete end to such advertising, to sponsorship of sporting
&gt; events by tobacco companies, etc.

As a practical matter, yes.  As a matter of law, no.  TTC isn't going
to be sponsoring tennis tournaments any time soon, I trust?  It's 
*big* tobacco that is under attack here -- the small fry don't matter.

&gt; BTW, we're not the only ones who think this agreement, and the enabling
&gt; legislation which is supposed to come from Congress, raise very serious
&gt; constitutional questions.

Could you find a reference to this putative enabling legislation? I
think it is a figment of somebody's imagination.  My impression was
that the "stick" wasn't new legislation, but rather the imminent
regulation of nicotine as a drug.  There *may* be such legislation in
the works, but it seems completely unnecessary for the anti-tobacco
forces to accomplish their aims, and, in fact, a stupid thing to 
depend on.

&gt; The problem may lie in class action suits in general. 

Completely different issue, I believe, one I would not care to argue 
either way.

[...]
&gt; 
&gt; There are indeed deep constitutional issues involved in both of the cases
&gt; being discussed in this thread.

There may be some constitutional issues in the ratings issue, but all 
I have seen on this thread so far is speculation about issues that 
*might* be present.
