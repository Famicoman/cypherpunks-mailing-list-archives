&gt; From: Lucky Green &lt;shamrock@netcom.com&gt;
&gt; Subject: Direct satellite systems?

&gt; My local cable killing Mars rover deployment in favor of local dog tag
&gt; ordinances (as required by the city), made me realize it that getting my
&gt; own dish is way overdue.
&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate reports on any first hand experiences subscribers to
&gt; this list have with satellite services. Yes, NASA TV and the SF channel is
&gt; a must. :-)

NASA Select is the actual transponder you want to use for NASA stuff. Get
any of the numerous satellite magazines and they will include not only a
map of the commercial satellites but their location and other niceities.
Note that this is not all the satellites you can receive since those not
on the plane of the eccliptic will require a different mast-head (it
requires both RA and declinination, where most low-cost commercial stuff
only has RA). You will also want to check out comp.space.news and pick up
the new satellite listings that come out about once a week or so. You will
also get solar weather alerts on this newsgroup as well.

The main downside a satellite system is that you don't get any of the local
stations.

On the hardware front, decide now what kind of coverage you want. If you
have any hopes for a satellite modem (which can be quite fun to play with)
then don't get the digital dish but go with the older C/K band dishes (3m).

The setup that I use (and suggest) is:

 - local cable, at least minimal services to get the local stations

 - C/K band setup with dual decoders so that you can watch two transponder
   channels per bird

 - digital dish to receive the newer systems (if you can find a good
   source for digital sat modems for these please let me know)

I'll give you a hint on how to get started, get to know somebody in the
local sat business and get them to let you know when they replace an old
C/K band system with a new digital systems. Usualy they throw the dish,
mast-head, and cable away because they have no resale value. I got both
of my C/K dishes this way. Spent maybe $100 on cables and connectors not
counting the concrete I used to mount the masts.

With the changes in the cable laws you can now buy hacks to the boxes on the
open market. I *strongly* suggest making this purchase as anonymous as
possible. My cable guy gets a visit from the FCC about once a year on some
purchase he made. I get my ROM's and such at various electronic, hamfest,
and video get togethers that happen in and around Ctl. Texas. I am shure if
you check in your local areas similar events occur. (hint: get somebody else
to drive to the event in their car and pay with cash only and never tell
them anything about your real name or location).

Last tip, buy your own center level and don't be stingy on the cost. The
more vertical you can get your mast the happier you will be in the long
run.

Hope it helps.
