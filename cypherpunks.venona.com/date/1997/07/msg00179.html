&gt;"Secret Power" by Nicki Hagar 
&gt;The International Spying Networks UKUSA and ECHELON
&gt;301pp ISBN: 0-908802-35-8 
&gt;
&gt;According to this remarkable book, that has somehow escaped the flames of
&gt;book banners crying "national security," the United States NSA and the
&gt;United Kingdom's GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) operate a
&gt;global spying network called UKUSA. To listen in on conversations across the
&gt;planet, a massive eavesdropping apparatus was built, with tentacles which
&gt;reach into dozens of different countries beyond the shores of either the US
&gt;or UK as well as across the skies.
&gt;
&gt;Describing the nature of UKUSA, its global affiliations, and operations
&gt;represents a huge effort on the part of author Nicki Hager. He states early
&gt;on in 'Secret Power':
&gt;
&gt;  "Many people are vaguely aware that a lot of spying occurs, maybe even on
&gt;  them, but how do we judge if it is ubiquitous or not a worry at all? Is
&gt;  someone listening every time we pick up the telephone? Are all of our
&gt;  Internet or fax messages being pored over continuously by shadowy figures
&gt;  somewhere in a windowless building?
&gt;
&gt;  "What follows explains as precisely as possible - and for the first time
&gt;  in public - how the worldwide [spy] system works, just how immense and
&gt;  powerful it is and what it can and cannot do.
&gt;
&gt;  "The global system has a highly secret codename: ECHELON."
&gt;
&gt;And that is the foundation of a tremendous amount of research that describes
&gt;in detail how the vast global spying network "collects all the telephone
&gt;calls, faxes, telexes, Internet messages and other electronic communications
&gt;that its computers have been pre-programmed to select," and then analyzes
&gt;the contents and distributes it to members UKUSA and ECHELON partners
&gt;world-wide.
&gt;
&gt;The operational details of how the US (NSA), UK (GCHQ), Canada (CSE),
&gt;Australia (DSD) and New Zealand (GCSB) intercepts signals, throws high power
&gt;computing behind ECHELON 'KeyWord' dictionary attacks and what they do with
&gt;that information is potentially alarming; especially since so much of this
&gt;decades old practice has been kept under the wraps of security.
&gt;
&gt;Secret Power names the names, provides the dates and the technical details
&gt;on the world's largest, best financed and coordinated global spying
&gt;apparatus ever conceived. Full of pictures, maps and charts, the reader will
&gt;get a complete picture of just how much effort and resources go into
&gt;international security, long distance eavesdropping, and spying.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the Cold War to today, UKUSA and ECHELON have been fascinating and
&gt;powerful intelligence functions to spy both on enemies and friends. "Secret
&gt;Power" provides the first peek inside the world's most secretive and
&gt;powerful electronic spy organization.
&gt;
&gt;"Secret Power" reads like a thriller, except that it's true. It should be
&gt;read by everyone with an interest in intelligence, espionage and the
&gt;technology that modern spies use.
&gt;
&gt;"An astonishing number of people have told him [author Nicki Hager] things
&gt;that I, as Prime Minister in charge of the intelligence services, was never
&gt;told...It is an outrage that I and other ministers were told so little."
&gt;        -David Lange, Prime Minister of New Zealand 1984-89 
&gt;
&gt;"...the most detailed and up to date account of the work of any signals
&gt;intelligence agency in existence. It is a masterpiece of investigative
&gt;reporting, and provides a wealth of information."
&gt;        -Jeffrey T. Richelson, leading authority on United States
&gt;intelligence agencies and author of America's Secret Eyes in the Sky, and
&gt;co-author of 'The Ties that Bind.'
