&gt; &gt; my posts should be read by children of all ages, no matter what

&gt; 
&gt;   I have to agree with the rat-bastard, cocksucking, motherfucking
&gt; sack of shit, Tim May, on this one.

When Timmy is not flaming me, he usually talks sense.

FWIW, my 8 y o has his own IBM Aptiva, his own Internet access, his own
e-mail box, and I exercise absolutely no control over what he reads or
says on the Internet.

&gt;   Having Tourette Syndrome, I object to anal retentives who would
&gt; criminalize my God-given verbal predelictions. Neither would my
&gt; receiving an exception on the grounds of being disabled be remotely
&gt; acceptable to me, since I sincerely believe that my TS is a "gift"
&gt; that allows me to say anything that others say to a judge, *plus*
&gt; being able to call him or her a Nazi ratfucker. (Anyone who thinks
&gt; this is a "disability" is fucking crazy.)
&gt; 
&gt;   On the other hand, it would be kind of neat to launch a class action
&gt; lawsuit demanding that ratings systems incorporate a label such as:
&gt; "Suitable (FUCK!) for children (COCKSUCKER!) with Tourette Syndrome"

&gt; &gt; Act of 1996]
&gt; &gt; And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
&gt; &gt; don't you boys just come on in and fuck them right here in my house - I'll
&gt; &gt; just watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said:
&gt; &gt; "Dad's getting old. I say we should fuck him before he's too old to fuck."
&gt; &gt; So the two daughters got him drunk and screwed him all that night. Sure
&gt; &gt; enough, Dad got them pregnant, and had an incestuous bastard son....Onan
&gt; &gt; really hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant
&gt; &gt; while his brother got all the credit, so he pulled out before he
&gt; &gt; came....Remember, it's not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your
&gt; &gt; brother, your parents, your pet dog, or the farm animals, unless of course
&gt; &gt; God tells you to. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern Vernacular
&gt; &gt; Translation, TCM, 1996]
