Learn the Internet tools that are used to investigate you, your 

friends, neighbors, enemies, Employees or anyone else!  My huge

Social security, current or past employment, Driving records, 

medical information, addresses, phone numbers, Maps to city

of stories about PERSONAL INFORMATION being used, traded, and sold 

over the Internet... usually without your permission or knowledge. 

With my report I show you HOW IT'S DONE!!!

turns what once was years of work into hours of DISCOVERY &amp;
