Get 'em while you can....

&gt;  Meantime, taking their cue from the Tobacco Nazis, the city of

It's been apparent for many years that the Plan is to to disarm Americans,
as most Europeans, Canadians, and Brits have already been disarmed. Suing
the gun manufacturers is the new approach. (But what will the military do
when Colt becomes insolvent, when Smith and Wesson and Ruger and all the
rest seek bankruptcy protection? I guess there's always SIG, Heckler &amp;
Koch, and Beretta...those damned Europeans may be disarming their
citizen-units, but they're not doing it by suing their corporations!)

Me, I stocked up on guns bought with cash at the San Jose and San Francisco
Gun Shows, where money changed hands without any IDs being presented. (Plus
an emergency run to Reno in 1993 to beat the deadline imposed by
Swinestein's new legislation in Kalfornia.) Most of my guns are
unregistered, unreported, and known only to me. And I've made certain to
scatter a few of them in safe deposit boxes, and in the usual sealed
"planters."

The storm troopers are preparing to disarm the citizen units.

Remember, KTW bullets pierce Kevlar vests. The jackbooted thugs want these
KTW bullets outlawed. Get 'em while you still can, which won't be for long.

(Don't buy them in Kalifornia, as you'll likely be caught in a sting,
courtesy of Uberfascist Dan Lungren. Buy them out of state. An H&amp;K 91 is a
pretty good dispensor of these KTWs. Colt or equivalent AR-15s and clones
are also pretty good. Though I haved to admit that I'm kind of having a
"retro" phase, finding my Winchester 94 Wrangler, in .44 Magnum, is pretty
handy. It's now the rifle I tend to have in my hand when I answer the door.
A lot handier than the ubiquitous SKS Chicom pieces of shit. Friends of
mine keep telling me to go for a Benelli Super 90 Tactical Shotgun, but I
guess the handier .44 Mag carbine fits me better at this time.)

Me, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's office has already let me know that I'm
on a list of suspected militia supporters. After OKC, anyone with an
arsenal is suspect. We each know who the enemy is.

Whatever happened to the Second Amendment?
