&gt;&gt; We do not believe ratings are appropriate for news sites or sites that are
&gt;&gt; geared toward public discussion of political/social issues (CDT has refused
&gt;&gt; to rate our sites with RSAC).
&gt;
&gt;Of course that hasn't stopped CDT from, as I understand it, proposing
&gt;a "public service site" exemption to RSAC, similar to the "news site"
&gt;exemption.
&gt;
&gt;Under such an RSAC-PS scheme, organizations defined as legitimate "public
&gt;service" groups -- and only those groups! -- would be exempt from labeling
&gt;each of their pages for violence, nudity, and so on. After all, if CDT
&gt;wanted to label and the RSAC-PS scheme didn't exist, they'd have to cordon
&gt;off the portion of their site with the Pacifica decision as inappropriate
&gt;for children. The RSAC working group discussed "public service sites,"
&gt;according to RSAC head Stephen Balkam, during a conference call on
&gt;July 10.

This echoes a similar dichotomy between the alleged "rights" of newsmen to
"protect their sources" and the rights of non-newsment to protect their
sources or confidants. I have never believed that a reporter for the
"Washington Post" has any more rights to refuse to disclose his
conversations than I have. The so-called "shield laws" seem to create
protected classes of the rights of free speech and association (and
"privacy" in a sense).

Same as with "religious confessionals." If I claim that conversations I
have are part of a priest-penitent or "confessional" relation--after all, I
am a prelate in the First Church of Odin--and the courts claim I am not a
"valid" religion....

Giving special status to some news organizations or some religious
organizations is a clearcut violation of the First.
