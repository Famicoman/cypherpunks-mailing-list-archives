Mike,
  I found this post either really funny or really scary.
  Maybe both.

&gt;  &gt; I'll be curious to see what kind of deal he got.  It had
&gt;  &gt; better be an awfully good one (say "time served").  If not
&gt;  &gt; he was as dumb as toast.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's hope it was not the "8 years" I heard on the evening news,
&gt; although I didn't catch whether that was just a possible
&gt; sentence, or the results of the plea bargain negotiations.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; He had a perfect chance to rake the Feds over the
&gt;  &gt; coals and try nasty disfavored defenses like
&gt;  &gt; Selective Prosecution.  Hard to win that one but
&gt;  &gt; he had as good a case as any one I've seen for
&gt;  &gt; that defense.  At the most, he would have gotten a
&gt;  &gt; short sentence if convicted.  Big deal.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps.  But he would have been tried in the media, and would
&gt; probably have been transformed into "Terrorist Jim Bell" at the
&gt; hands of the spin masters.  In the end, even if he won in court,
&gt; he would have been about as popular as OJ, and the entire
&gt; population of America would have learned to live their lives in
&gt; constant fear of smelly organic chemicals and nickel-plated
&gt; carbon fibers. Parents would be mail-ordering carbon fiber test
&gt; kits to use in their childrens' rooms.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Since he was apparently not doing a great deal with his
&gt;  &gt; life in any case, he could have used it for some good.  Make
&gt;  &gt; the Feds spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on him and
&gt;  &gt; tie up their resources.
&gt; 
&gt; I would certainly try to make any such harrassment of me as
&gt; expensive as possible for those engaging in it.  On the other
&gt; hand, Bell does have living relatives, which makes unilateral
&gt; nose-thumbing at the state apparatus more risky.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Prison is no punishment for those who like to read and write.
&gt; 
&gt; Being bossed around by assholes is always annoying, regardless of
&gt; ones academic interests.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; In these political cases where the Feds are clearly
&gt;  &gt; overreaching, those who don't plead do much better than
&gt;  &gt; those who do.  This is the reverse of the situation in
&gt;  &gt; normal criminal cases.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell that to Robert "ream me again, please" Thomas of Amateur
&gt; Action BBS fame, who wasn't even accused of being a potential
&gt; terrorist, much less of trying to overthrow the entire
&gt; government.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Don't plead in political cases.  It's stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't plead in political cases like Steve Jackson Games, PROMIS,
&gt; Operation Sun Devil, etc...  On the other hand, if you are
&gt; accused of being one of the actual Four Horsemen, and the feds
&gt; are holding press conferences on every channel with inflammatory
&gt; voice-over editorials describing the alleged contents of your
&gt; dwelling, some capitulation to the Barbarians may be necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; There are a number of adages which apply to this situation,
&gt; amongst them...
&gt; 
&gt;     Don't get involved in fights you can't win.
&gt; 
&gt;     When you aim for the King, shoot to kill.
&gt; 
&gt;     The goal of war is not to die for your country, but to make
&gt;     sure the enemy dies for theirs.
&gt; 
&gt;     etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Enumerating Bell's violations of these common sense principles is
&gt; left as an exercise to the reader.
