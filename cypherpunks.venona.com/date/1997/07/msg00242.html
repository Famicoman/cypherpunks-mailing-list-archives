&gt; In interviews and in federal lawsuits, NSA workers say some of the agency's
&gt; most senior personnel are being forced out as the nation's biggest
&gt; intelligence agency attempts simultaneously to reduce and diversify its
&gt; staff.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result, some question whether national security is being imperiled by
&gt; inexperienced employees being promoted to sensitive jobs to meet hiring
&gt; quotas.

  Let me see if I get this straight...
  National security is important enough to strip the citizens of their
rights and freedoms and trample the constitution into the mud, but 
National Security is not so important that it can't be compromised for 
the purpose of removing competent white males from their jobs and
replacing them with less experienced and/or incompetent colored people
and women.

&gt; The main concern, though, is whether, in its push to diversify its work
&gt; force, the agency is leaving sensitive national security tasks in the hands
&gt; of untrained workers. One former NSA veteran offered as evidence a recent
&gt; travel report.
&gt; 
&gt; Such reports, which are required of NSA employees after business trips, are
&gt; unclassified, available on request to anyone outside the agency. The report
&gt; in question, filed by an inexperienced agent, detailed a trip to a city in
&gt; Colombia that revealed classified details of the Drug Enforcement Agency's
&gt; operation, down to the location of offices, names and secret technological
&gt; information.

  Of course, when DEA agents are murdered because of incompetent
affirmative
action promotees at NSA, the government will call for stronger controls
on
encryption and greater powers of surveillance of the citizens.

&gt; Such slips are not the only national security risk, NSA veterans say. This
&gt; year, the agency's personnel office, prompted by a growing number of
&gt; incidents, warned employees against using the Internet to access adult "news"
&gt; groups and other pornographic sites.
&gt; 
&gt; Doing so not only violates NSA work rules but is considered a risk because
&gt; foreign agents could try to blackmail employees discovered with explicit or
&gt; illegal pornography.

  While the government blackmails its own citizens with legislation
which
threatens to imprison them for actions matching those of NSA employees.

&gt; Now women and minority candidates receive at least one round of extra
&gt; consideration for promotion, which means a minority woman receives three
&gt; chances to advance to a white man's one.

  Is the White House declaring this a victory for minorities, drug
dealers
and child pornographers? Politics makes for strange bedfellows.
