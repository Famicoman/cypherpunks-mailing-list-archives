&gt; &gt;James D. Bell was charged Wednesday with interfearing with a federal
&gt; &gt;officer
&gt; &gt;and using false Social Security numbers.  He has been held without
&gt; &gt;bail in the Pierce County Jail since his May 18 arrest.

&gt; [Warning! Old, politically incorrect law school joke coming up.]
&gt; What was the biggest charge reduction in the history of plea bargaining?
&gt; That would have been the reduction from a charge of Sodomy to a charge of
&gt; Following Too Close. -- From the International Committee for the Preservation
&gt; of Politically Incorrect Law School Jokes.

  I was arrested for "arson." They said that if I'd turned her over,
then the charge would have been "rape."
  My lawyer pleaded it down to "assault with a friendly weapon."
(The prosecutor argued for "dangerous weapon," but I was fortunate
enough to have a male judge, so the evidence didn't stand up in
court when it was presented for inspection.)

&gt; &gt;In an affidavit for the search warrant, IRS Special Investigator Jeff
&gt; &gt;Gordon said that Bell was "directly soliciting others to set up a system
&gt; &gt;to murder government officials" and that he had devised a plan to
&gt; &gt;overthrow the government.
&gt; 
&gt; So where are these "others" and why are they still being allowed to walk the
&gt; streets? 

  Perhaps the others are all decent, law-abiding conspirators who
planned to have Dr.Kevorkian "help" government officials and, rather
than "overthowing" the government, will merely act as executors 
(pardon the pun) of the e$tate.

&gt; All right.  You forced me.  "Why do they call it the 'Reasonable Man Test'?
&gt; Because there's no such thing as a reasonable woman."  (See Above)  [Duck and
&gt; Cover!]

  Everyone knows what "Coyote Ugly" is...do you know what "Jailbird
Ugly" is?
  It's when a woman is so ugly that her rapist is sentenced to
_do_ her again--from the front.

Something's wrong when I'm sodomized under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the dick grabbers is warranted: "Pull!...Pull!"
