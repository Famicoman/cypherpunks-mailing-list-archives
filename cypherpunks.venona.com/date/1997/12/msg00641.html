&gt;Subject: Y2K ANNOUNCE&gt;&gt; If I were President/Dictator
&gt;Sender: owner-year2000-announce@year2000.com
&gt;
&gt;Last month Peter de Jager announced a contest to submit
&gt;suggestions about what you would do about the year 2000
&gt;problem if you were president (of any country) for a day.
&gt;Peter also suggested that humorous entries be submitted
&gt;with the title "If I were supreme dictator!"  Below you
&gt;will find the winning entries along with some of the
&gt;honorable mentions.  --Cliff Kurtzman
&gt;
&gt;--------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Greetings folks,
&gt;
&gt;    The "If I were President" contest winner (out of 99
&gt;entries) is Nancy L. Osterhaus.  The "If I were Dictator"
&gt;contest winner (out of 20 entries) is Richard Kennard.
&gt;You will find both entries below, along with a number of
&gt;the honorable mentions.
&gt;
&gt;    Contests are tough... I find a 'winner' out of the
&gt;many good and excellent submissions to always come down
&gt;to a handful of choices... and choosing at that point
&gt;is honestly a random event. It is seldom a winner is a
&gt;'certain' winner. Nancy... you won... and the others?
&gt;several came very close and two others were a toss up.
&gt;
&gt;    The "If I were Dictator" entries were even tougher
&gt;to judge. Especially since after awhile... some were
&gt;beginning to make sense!!! (I need to get a life!)
&gt;Sad thing is... some of these are considered as serious
&gt;suggestions by some of the people I've spoken with over
&gt;the years.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I can only do my best...

&gt;IF I WERE PRESIDENT
&gt;===================
&gt;
&gt;Winning Entry:
&gt;
&gt;From: "Nancy L. Osterhaus"
&gt;To: pdejager@year2000.com
&gt;Date: Tue, 21 Oct 1997 16:55:37 -0500
&gt;Subject: If I were President
&gt;
&gt;Action Items:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Communication to the world the magnitude of the problem, the real
&gt;issues, the real impact
&gt;
&gt;This is a denial project.   Most people do not understand the impact of the
&gt;year 2000 on them.. on their lifestyle, the way they do business, and their
&gt;health and future.  I work in a large company that has a strong awareness
&gt;campaign, but during my "time off" talk to local businesses, hospitals,
&gt;etc.   They are very unaware of the issues.  If the grand Y2K world-wide
&gt;project, is to succeed, we need to get past the first phase ....
&gt;Communication &amp; Commitment.  The president could enable this by holding a
&gt;Town Meeting with a panel of experts to explain the problem, impact,
&gt;solution, and government plans for compliance.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Commitment to prioritize and repair of what he's responsible for
&gt;(Government systems, banking, infrastructure, etc.)
&gt;
&gt;Publishing a plan to show people that this is a serious issue, and the
&gt;government has taken the step of prioritizing their systems and developed a
&gt;plan to ensure compliance.  Publish the individual department plans,
&gt;lessons learned, etc.
&gt;
&gt;3.  Publicly report on the progress of government Y2K projects on a regular
&gt;basis (at least quarterly)
&gt;
&gt;Report to the nation and to the world on the progress of year 2000
&gt;compliance in the government sector.  By providing regular updates to the
&gt;nation we will gain increased awareness of the issues and in addition we
&gt;can hold our government accountable for their projects and progress towards
&gt;compliance.
&gt;
&gt;Nancy
&gt;
&gt;==========================================================================
&gt;
&gt;And here are a selection of other suggestions: Some of the good ones,
&gt;most of the great ones and a handful of ringers. You decide which is which.
&gt;Yours truly, Peter.
&gt;
&gt;From: "Dyer, Wayne"
&gt;
&gt;1. Request congress to modify tax code
&gt;        The costs of a company making corrections for Year 2000 should be
&gt;considered an investment in the future - therefore they should be
&gt;treated favorably at tax time. Everything possible should be done to
&gt;encourage companies to deal with the problem - and tax policy is the key
&gt;way to influence business decisions.
&gt;
&gt;2. Limit year 2000 liability
&gt;        The year 2000 problem was caused by "standard practices" in the
&gt;software industry. No company should have to worry about mega lawsuits
&gt;because of year 2000. Companies can be held accountable for the quality
&gt;of their products, but absolutely nothing will be gained by shareholder
&gt;suits against companies merely because they didn't start early enough to
&gt;fully correct the problem
&gt;
&gt;3. Change Social Security earnings limits
&gt;        Retired programmers should be encouraged to "come out" of
&gt;retirement to
&gt;work on year 2000. Because social security benefits are reduced for each
&gt;dollar earned above a set limit, many will probably not want to work.
&gt;This limit should be waived for people working on YR2K.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Kevin Whelan
&gt;
&gt;1. Require Y2K preparedness report from all organizations.
&gt;Require all organizations to file a standard report that would be
&gt;available via Internet on their Y2K preparedness status.
&gt;
&gt;2. All software/hardware vendors publish Y2K info on Internet.
&gt;Require all manufacturers and software vendors to publish by specific
&gt;model and/or version the Y2K compliance status of each of their products in
&gt;use, to be viewable on the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;3. Monthly Y2K TV program during prime time.
&gt;The government will sponsor an hour Y2K awareness TV program monthly
&gt;during prime time from 1998 until it's over.
&gt;
&gt;Kevin
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Iain MacKenzie
&gt;
&gt;1. Raise awareness. Real awareness. Tell the people that this is a *real*
&gt;problem, on *all* makes, models, types of computer. Tell them that
&gt;*everything*
&gt;should be checked. Explain *why*. Explain the difference between 'is
&gt;capable of
&gt;storing' and 'is actually populated with' and the connection this has to
&gt;2-digit data entry, for example.
&gt;
&gt;2. Explain what every computer-owner should be doing. Tell them what they need
&gt;to do to check and resolve their own problems. This is the 'facts and data'
&gt;part of the message.
&gt;
&gt;3. Talk about scheduling and panic. There *is* time to fix the problem. (There
&gt;*has* to be, the time is fixed. We (Y2k folk) will have to vary our
&gt;solution as
&gt;time goes by). If all companies establish a plan and follow it we will all end
&gt;up with a h*** of a party on 31/12/1999 but no major problems. A sort of 'Your
&gt;*Company* Needs YOU' message.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "Mau, Michelle"
&gt;
&gt;IF I WERE A PRESIDENT..
&gt;1.      Make Giants Pay
&gt;Make  the major  computer giants - SUN, IBM, MICROSOFT, SAP, ORACLE,
&gt;etc, to contribute $1 billion each for each year  until the year 2001 to
&gt;fund the awareness campaign of the y2k. The idea is to highlight the
&gt;criticality side of y2k which is a business problem - not just an IT
&gt;problem. Everyone from floor operations right through to the  middle
&gt;management up to the senior management should be aware of this bug and
&gt;its impact to the running of the business.  School children should also
&gt;have some idea what this is all about as they are our growing IT
&gt;customers.  Most of  them are already familiar with the Internet and
&gt;computer games.  It is time for IT to lift its game and include everyone
&gt;on y2k - equity through IT is great to break down the social barriers
&gt;and the barriers of haves and haves-not.
&gt;
&gt;2.      TAX   Incentives
&gt;Have an incentive program for SMEs (Small and Medium sized enterprises)
&gt;to have at least 70 percent tax deductions for their expenses in
&gt;managing and fixing y2k bug before Dec 31, 1999. After Dec 31, 1999, the
&gt;tax deduction will be lowered to 30 percent so that these organisations
&gt;will be motivated to start their y2k project now than later to make such
&gt;claims from their tax.  This is already happening in Singapore. It will
&gt;be great if developed nations like Australia could bring this policy
&gt;into effect immediately rather than leaving it a bit  too late.  SMEs
&gt;are the backbone of the industries in this country and they should be
&gt;assisted and motivated to launch their y2k project.  y2k compliance
&gt;definition and testing tools should be made available to everyone via
&gt;the NET, brochures and awareness campaign which I have already
&gt;mentioned.  Perhaps the example set by our Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett
&gt;in providing  jobs  to the unemployed to test software compliancy with
&gt;y2k using a set of standard tools  should be applauded.
&gt;
&gt;3.      Product Compliance Info through the NET
&gt;Use the web to publicise which products are y2k compliant. If these
&gt;products are not yet compliant, where do users get more updated info and
&gt;when will these products be compliant? Which version or model? What
&gt;course of action is recommended to users - retire, replace or risk it?
&gt;What about products which have embedded technology  that may have impact
&gt;on the organisation?
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;From: Noel Goyette
&gt;
&gt;1.  Fire the head (not the CIO) of agencies which have not made real
&gt;progress now.  Time is a lever which is rapidly getting shorter, and
&gt;agencies are laying this problem on the CIOs without resources.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Get the SEC to investigate the real Y2K project status of industry,
&gt;starting with the embedded systems in the utilities.
&gt;
&gt;3.  Reconsitute the Continuity of Operations Plans of the federal
&gt;government, which have been abandonded and unfunded as a result of the end
&gt;of the cold war.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "Joe Allegra"
&gt;
&gt;1.  Convene a meeting for a couple of days in Washington DC with
&gt;Government and Business Leaders to discuss this issue.  I would prep
&gt;the meeting by coming up with a list of 10 questions that CEOs need
&gt;to ask themselves.  For example:  Do you a credible plan to become
&gt;Year 2000 compliant?  How big is this IT project relative to other
&gt;IT projects?  Has your IT staff ever attempted a project of this
&gt;size?  What is the track record of your IT department in completing
&gt;large projects on time? If you lost all of your computer systems,
&gt;what would be the impact to your business.  etc. etc.  I would also
&gt;bring in people that could document through real live experiences
&gt;how big the project really is.
&gt;
&gt;Having a Washington based meeting convened by the President would get
&gt;the media into this in a big way.
&gt;
&gt;2.  I would convene a high level group to monitor and report monthly
&gt;on the compliance activities of the key sectors of the economy.
&gt;Alan Greenspan to monitor the banking system; others to monitor
&gt;transportation, power, telecommunications.
&gt;
&gt;3.  I would ask the Group of 7 (or is it 8) countries to convene a
&gt;special meeting to discuss this issue at the president/prime minister
&gt;level.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Eugene Hatting
&gt;
&gt;1)      Institute legislation that ALL government institutions must have
&gt;started taking adequate steps by December 1997, in order to address the
&gt;year 2000 problem.
&gt;
&gt;2)      Institute legislation that all large non-governmental
&gt;companies/corporations who make a positive contribution towards the
&gt;economy, must have started taking adequate steps by December 1997, in order
&gt;to address the year 2000 problem.
&gt;
&gt;Hefty penalties and possible criminal prosecutions could follow if the
&gt;above institutions do not abide by these rulings.
&gt;
&gt;3)      I would institute certain tax benefits or other insensitives to
&gt;those companies who have taken adequate steps to address the problem and/or
&gt;who have obtained year 2000 compliance (as defined by my governmental
&gt;department) by date  x.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Yvonne Rediger
&gt;
&gt;1.  Tax break/incentive program for companies that are compliant by a
&gt;specific date.
&gt;        The companies would have to prove compliancy by a set of citeria,
&gt;put in
&gt;place by a board, and that      board would award #2.
&gt;
&gt;2.  A CSA approved Logo.
&gt;        The Logo could be placed on their products and displayed on
&gt;advertising
&gt;etc.  proclaiming them Year 2000 Compliant.  Thus selling insurance that
&gt;their company will be around in the coming years.  Right now any company
&gt;can make that claim.
&gt;
&gt;3.  Make government departments set specific delines for their own
&gt;compliancy and stick to them.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Dr. Ibrahim El-Miligi
&gt;
&gt;a) Set up a presidential working group (please not a committee) to over see
&gt;that :-
&gt;       * All government and semi-government  organizations have or set up a
&gt;plan and initiated action to be Y2K compliant. If not then some penalties
&gt;should be levied (including the firing of some heads)
&gt;        * Should report to me regularly in special meeting of cabinet
&gt;ministers.
&gt;
&gt;b) Media awareness! Medial will be instructed to focus on the Y2K problem
&gt;with interviews, discussion groups, research programs, case studies .. etc.
&gt;I noticed in my country that there is a miserable state of media awareness!!
&gt;
&gt;c) I will sponsor conferences and other forums to give the right perspective
&gt;to the public of the seriousness of the problem.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Rick Mol
&gt;
&gt;The government should not be in the business decision business.  The year
&gt;2000 issue is basically an issue for the various companies to solve
&gt;themselves.
&gt;
&gt;Historically, when government gets involved in making these types of
&gt;decisions, it doesn't do near as good of a job as the free market.  What we
&gt;would end up with is a series of legislative fiats that are made by people
&gt;that have no concept of the problem.  They seem to have this idea that "we
&gt;can pass a law and fix this".  What will happen is that this will cost the
&gt;industry money and add more requirements.
&gt;So, if I were President, I'd get out of the they way and let industry solve
&gt;it themselves.  They will do a MUCH better job than legislation will.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Barry Blauer
&gt;
&gt;     1. Appoint a leader:
&gt;        Choose a project leader to direct a project to make the entire
&gt;        government (our enterprise) compliant for the Year2000.  Give this
&gt;        person authority to marshall the resources, establish the plan, and
&gt;        direct the effort.
&gt;
&gt;     2. Issue the challenge:
&gt;        Request every direct report to deliver a complete plan of handling
&gt;        the Year2000 problems within his/her organization, including
&gt;        resource requirements,  Require prioritization from each group,
&gt;        identifying mission-critical systems which would cause disasters if
&gt;        they were allowed to fail.  The plan needs to include a completion
&gt;        date of 12/31/1998 for all renovation.
&gt;
&gt;     3. Inform the customers:
&gt;        Develop a mechanism to report to the public the regular progress of
&gt;        the project, within national security boundaries.  Challenge
&gt;        private industry to follow our lead, to ensure the entire country
&gt;        will be prepared when the clock rolls over.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: MATTHEW CHAPMAN
&gt;
&gt;1) Ensure that there was a "Year 2000 Czar"  in charge of Government
&gt;compliancy.  This position/person would be chartered with first
&gt;establishing the state of where the Federal Government stands as a
&gt;whole in the scope of making the government systems Y2K compliant.
&gt;The fist "charter" of this Czar, would be to make sure the military is at the
&gt;head of the list, and that all possible scenarios are being investigated,
&gt;analyzed, and ultimately made to be compliant.
&gt;
&gt;2) I would personally address my fellow world leaders with the same
&gt;charge, for them to actively pursue this issue as a "top" priority, once
&gt;again with initial focus on their weapons stockpiles and missile silos.
&gt;
&gt;3) I would provide periodic updates to the nation, as to the status of the
&gt;country as a whole.  This would acknowledge the Y2K issue as one of
&gt;importance, that should not be ignored or postponed any longer.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Ric Kelperis
&gt;
&gt;     1) Recognize the importance of resource continuity, and waive taxes
&gt;     for all I/S employees that maintain their current employment. This
&gt;     would not only incent people to stay where they are, but to perform
&gt;     well also.
&gt;
&gt;     2) Assign a United States Year 2000 Secretary
&gt;
&gt;     3) Require a public quarterly status report from all departments of
&gt;     government.
&gt;
&gt;     4) Require independent certification for all life threatening
&gt;     situations, such as air traffic controlling software, etc.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "William Baker"
&gt;
&gt;1. Assess the outcome which is most predictable, given the
&gt;    actions in motion in government and the private sector.
&gt;    Charter a highly visible and media exposed team to report
&gt;    this assessment by Q1 1998.
&gt;
&gt;2. Pass legislation limiting legal and liability ramifications of
&gt;    non-compliant systems, try to avoid a disaster in the courts,
&gt;    frivolous law suits, and the destruction of the US economy
&gt;    by lawyers.
&gt;
&gt;3. Establish a SWAT team ( or teams ) which can be directed at
&gt;    the most serious problems of internal and interfacing
&gt;    conversion and education issues within pinpointed Federal
&gt;    government " hot spots."
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: nara
&gt;
&gt;Rename the year after 1999 as 199A (A for 10 in hex):
&gt;
&gt;Call an international conference of all world leaders (UN would have
&gt;served a useful purpose) and rename the year after 1999 as 199A.
&gt;
&gt;Declare 'A' as a character as well as a integer in all new programs.
&gt;
&gt;This would at least buy us some time and name the year after 199A as
&gt;2000.  We can buy more time by renaming the following year as 199B and
&gt;so on...
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: John Austin
&gt;
&gt;1.      Let the public know.  The American public is still mostly unaware
&gt;that there is a problem.  The president needs to let the American public
&gt;know that everyone may have problems in 2000 or even before--and that it
&gt;might be your bank, gas station, power company, etc. that might fail.
&gt;
&gt;2.      Wake the US government up.  Many agencies still have not got a
&gt;workable Year 2000 plan.  Chief concerns are the Defense Department and
&gt;the IRS (which finds itself asking for more and more money).  While more
&gt;attention is being paid to the latter, with budget crunches we are
&gt;likely to come a cropper on 1 January 2000 (or later).
&gt;
&gt;3.      Sell Y2K Budget to Congress.  To do all this will cost many many
&gt;dollars.  A chief issue will of course be to get these increased budgets
&gt;for these agencies through this Congress, which wants to cut deficits.
&gt;A sales job showing that money spent now will save more later is needed.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "Vernon K. Jacobs"
&gt;
&gt;(1) begin the development of a backup system to substitute
&gt;a national sales tax (either temporary or permanent) to secure
&gt;government revenues when the IRS computer systems stop working
&gt;after 12/31/99,
&gt;
&gt;(2) veto any legislation that will require added time and funds
&gt;to be spent on computer systems to the extent that any new
&gt;projects would compete with resources needed for the year-2000
&gt;efforts
&gt;
&gt;(3) require an immediate study of all government agencies and
&gt;activities that are not essential to the survival of the country
&gt;and develop a plan to shut down the systems of those agencies
&gt;or projects until all other agencies have become 2000-compliant.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "Bruins, David "
&gt;
&gt;First:
&gt;I would request a press conference in the morning with representatives
&gt;from both national news and computing periodicals.  Representatives from
&gt;companies that have successfully converted their software  would be
&gt;asked to attend and answer questions.  The emphasis would NOT be on what
&gt;COULD happen, but on what to do to fix it so NOTHING happens.  Enough
&gt;has been said on the potential problems and almost nothing has been said
&gt;on how to fix it.
&gt;
&gt;Second:
&gt;I would request that any Government organization that is still running
&gt;this effort as a development project to halt the "development cycle" and
&gt;start identifying and fixing code.  The point must be made clear that
&gt;this is not a 'Development' project.  This is a system bug.  The process
&gt;that is required to correct system bugs must be followed, not the
&gt;development cycle.  We are not developing anything new, we are fixing
&gt;code that does not work.
&gt;
&gt;Third:
&gt;I would propose a bill that would require that all systems, that may
&gt;cause the loss of human life due to a software or hardware failure due
&gt;to the turn of the century, be certified by 12/01/1998.  All identified
&gt;systems would be published, monthly up to that date and weekly after
&gt;that date, as being certified or not certified.  Use of uncertified
&gt;systems would be illegal after November 1999 attempted  manslaughter.
&gt;The number 1 criteria for certification would be that the system can be
&gt;tested for what will happen at the turn of the century.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "Rice, Bernie"
&gt;
&gt;1.      I'd use the bully pulpit.  Encourage public not to panic but to
&gt;be aware, and encourage the business community to pool efforts to
&gt;address the problem, like they did with regard to High Definition
&gt;Television.
&gt;2.      Establish a national telephone tree among Fortune 500 companies
&gt;to allow them to assist each other in the event of a crisis in any one
&gt;organization.
&gt;3.      Take this unprecedented opportunity to deliberately dismantle
&gt;the IRS as we know it.  If no one else does, Year-2000 complications
&gt;undoubtedly will, and with no forethought at all.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: Capers Jones
&gt;
&gt;1) Suspend anti-trust regulations for all year 2000 repairs and
&gt;encourage key industries to pool their year 2000 work.  Key industries
&gt;include banks, insurance, defense, telecommunications, airlines, public
&gt;utilities, etc.
&gt;
&gt;2) Have the IRS issue a public statement that they will not
&gt;automatically come after taxpayers whose returns are messed up due to
&gt;year 2000 errors.  Since the IRS itself will probably not be compliant,
&gt;this is the least they could do.
&gt;
&gt;3) Have the OMB publish a weekly update on year 2000 status of all
&gt;federal agencies, with contact information on all Y2K offices so that
&gt;citizens who have problems will know who to deal with.  This should
&gt;start in January of 1999 if not earlier.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From: "Dominic Ng"
&gt;
&gt;     1) Setting up the standard for the Y2K problem solution
&gt;
&gt;        Nowaday, the Y2K solutions between different consulting firms
&gt;        are different. If each systems are stand alone, well that's ok.
&gt;        However, they are communicating with each other through EDI or
&gt;        network, incompatibility between each system may worsen the
&gt;        situation. Therefore solution standard is very important in
&gt;        term of windowing or date format.
&gt;
&gt;     2) Asking the supervision from Federal Reserve department
&gt;        and Technology department
&gt;
&gt;        In the Y2K problem, the most suffering group would be financial
&gt;        institution because their business are highly depend on electronic
&gt;        exchange in term of date calculation. For this reason, Federal
&gt;        Reserve department and Technology department should supervise their
&gt;        Y2K projects meeting the deadline. The main aim is to avoid the
&gt;        crashdown of financial market.
&gt;
&gt;     3) Financial assistance for the poor companies
&gt;        in Y2K project
&gt;
&gt;        Y2K project is a expensive project especially for the old system
&gt;        because the skill is uncommon. Some small-sized or medium-size
&gt;        companies may not be able to prepare resource for Y2K project
&gt;        within a short period of time. Therefore government should provide
&gt;        financial assistance such as loan for the poor companies in Y2K
&gt;        project.

&gt;
&gt;I would just ignore the whole year 2000 and leave it for the Republicans to
&gt;deal with
&gt;
&gt;I would raise taxes to help the government deal with the problem and redirect
&gt;the tax revenue to my pet projects
&gt;
&gt;I would assign the project to Hillary to set up a task force and raise public
&gt;awareness and get them off my back about the other issues

&gt;Here's richard winning entry.

&gt;Date: Thu, 23 Oct 1997 08:50:29 -0500
&gt;
&gt;"If I were supreme dictator"
&gt;
&gt;I'd give it to Hilary to fix.
&gt;
&gt;============================================================
&gt;
&gt;Honorable mentions:
&gt;
&gt;From: "jtepley"
&gt;
&gt;1) Declare martial law and appoint a Y2K Czar to triage government,
&gt;industry, and company functions and systems.
&gt;
&gt;2) Draft anyone with professional computer experience, leaving 50% at their
&gt;current employer and using the other 50% to work on high priority (triaged)
&gt;government, industry, and company systems. Shoot selected protesters as
&gt;examples.
&gt;
&gt;3) Pass and enforce a law that requires all citizens to "kiss their ass
&gt;goodbye" every morning when they wake up until the year 2025.
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: "Dyer, Wayne"
&gt;
&gt;1. Declare that year 2010 follows year 1999. Then declare that 1999 was
&gt;really 2009, 1998 was really 2008, etc. etc. It would be much more
&gt;efficient to just change all the dates in files without changing date
&gt;logic. This would work in about 75% of the instances where companies only
&gt;deal with a few years in the future or the past.
&gt;
&gt;2. Change our current 7 day a week calendar to a 10 day a week calendar.
&gt;That way nobody would know what days of the week dates fell on in the past,
&gt;so nobody would care if date logic was fouled up!
&gt;
&gt;3. Make anybody who screams about the imminent collapse of society on Jan
&gt;1, 2000 write 10,000,000 times "I will not try to incite panic for my own
&gt;benefit anymore".
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Brad_Balassaitis
&gt;
&gt;1. Copyright the Phrase "Year 2000"
&gt;The first thing I would do is copyright the phrase "Year 2000" so that I
&gt;could charge royalties (or sue for infringement as the case may be) every
&gt;time it is printed, spoken, or even thought of. (I'm supreme dictator, so I
&gt;can copyright common words!) I would make a fortune (which I would keep in
&gt;cash under my mattress, of course).
&gt;
&gt;2. Collect the Royalties and Infringement Damages
&gt;Next, I would assign the entire staff of the CIA to spend all of their time
&gt;checking for copyright infringements, so that I could collect my rightful
&gt;royalties and infringement damages.
&gt;
&gt;3. Move to a Country that is Compliant!
&gt;Finally, I would move myself, my family, and my fortune to the first
&gt;country that is totally year 2000 compliant!!! Thus, I have (a) made a
&gt;fortune because of the problem, (b) put no thought, stress, or effort into
&gt;solving it, and (c) gone to a place where the problem is already taken care
&gt;of! (How truly American of me!)

&gt;From: Eric de Katow
&gt;
&gt;Plan-A: Hire Superman to rotate the earth backward, just like he did to
&gt;save Lois Lane, except he will go a couple years back. Then he will be in
&gt;charge of convincing the World of the magnitude of the Y2K problem and need
&gt;for readiness.
&gt;
&gt;Plan-B: Enact a law that will make the Year 2000 the Year 1900.
&gt;
&gt;Plan-C: Become a lawyer.
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Eugene
&gt;
&gt;1)      Have all calendars in America changed to tick over on 31 December
&gt;1999, to 1900 when the clock strikes 12:00. All other countries (trade
&gt;partners) would then just have to fit in with this arrangement (In South
&gt;Africa we have a saying: "Adapt or Die").
&gt;
&gt;2)      In case some companies forgot to change their calendars to the
&gt;above ruling, these companies/individuals will be forced to do business
&gt;with ONLY those who are not year 2000 compliant and will pay a penalty of
&gt;$1 000 000,00 per day for every day they are not compliant.
&gt;
&gt;3)      If the above two rules are not feasible, I would use the satellites
&gt;which Bill Gates planes to have put into space, to automatically download
&gt;the latest Windows 2000 and Office 2000 software on all computers across
&gt;America. A rule would then be implemented that everybody WILL be forced to
&gt;use the Microsoft products.
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Marilyn Nolin
&gt;
&gt;I would declare that when the year rolls over to 2000, it would actually be
&gt;1900! Like any good politician, I would pass the buck to the next
&gt;generations.

&gt;From: Dr. I. El-Miligi
&gt;
&gt;Dear Peter,
&gt;As in many countries (first, second or third world) scapegoats are required
&gt;to celebrate the turn of the centure. So, if I were a Zomba King, this is
&gt;what I would do :-
&gt;
&gt;a) Set up a royal commission headed by the most hated minister and assign
&gt;to them to solve the year 2YK problem
&gt;
&gt;b) Set up another royal commision to see that the first commission does NOT
&gt;achieve its goals
&gt;
&gt;c) Set up a court martial on the eve of the first day of the 21 first
&gt;century to execute the responsible persons In this way, the blame is place
&gt;somewhere the our good people will get rid the hated minister, Sorry, but
&gt;the Y2K is not solved yet.
&gt;
&gt;May our royal blessings be with you,
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Herve Klein
&gt;
&gt;i would first ban all computers in my country and replace all of them with
&gt;chinese type abacuses.
&gt;
&gt;second, it would create so many jobs that all economical crisis would
&gt;disappear, giving all unemployed enough work for centuries : replacers of
&gt;obsolete plastic computers by sweet wooden frames, manufacturers of modern
&gt;automatic abacuses, finger assisted trainers, ...
&gt;
&gt;third, wait for 1st january 2000 world crisis to sell (high price) my
&gt;nation's knowledge to all other worldwide countries in need as i would have
&gt;become, then, a visionary precursor !
&gt;
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: "Rice, Bernie"
&gt;
&gt;If I were supreme dictator...
&gt;1.      I'd Issue Year-2000 bonds. Lots of 'em. Redeemable when government
&gt;computer (non-Y2K compliant) reaches 2000 AD (1999,1900,1901...)
&gt;
&gt;2.      Simplify things and decree AD 2000 shall be The Year of Rice One.
&gt;(Well, Rice Zero, I suppose.)
&gt;
&gt;3.      Avoid holiday travel in year-end 1999.
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: "Hughes, Rich"
&gt;
&gt;If I were Supreme Dictator/President Clinton for a day, what would I tell
&gt;the world about the Year2000 problem? I would:
&gt;
&gt;1.) Tell the CIO's/CEO's of all american companies that this Year2000
&gt;"problem" is a fabrication by some opportunistic consulting companies and
&gt;that they really have nothing to worry about. If they haven't started by
&gt;January 1998, let them die (their company) with dignity, don't point out
&gt;their mismanagement.
&gt;
&gt;2.) Tell the world the truth, the US Federal Government has been treating
&gt;this so lightly that many of the agencies are going to be so screwed up
&gt;that they are going to have to hire 100,000's of thousands additional
&gt;do-nothings at exorbitant salaries and that the average citizen is going to
&gt;pay an additional $10,000 per year in income tax due to the poor planning
&gt;by the government managers.
&gt;
&gt;3.) Wish the Republican president that follows him the best of luck in
&gt;straightening out the mess.From: Tfshub@aol.com

&gt;Subject: if I were supreme dictator
&gt;
&gt;I would announce a press release that welfare checks would be cut off
&gt;and ask everyone to write to their representative and threaten to not elect
&gt;them again if the problem was not solved. This would get the problem fixed
&gt;in short order
&gt;
&gt;i would change the calendar so the problem would not happen
&gt;we could just add another month to get us through the swearing in of the
&gt;new president
&gt;
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Norbert Fassotte
&gt;
&gt;I would simply shoot everyone who has a Y2K-problem.
&gt;
&gt;A problem is only a problem if you make it a problem. So if I shoot
&gt;everyone who detects something and makes it a problem, I don't have a
&gt;problem.
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: mathew_hennessy
&gt;
&gt;...I'd remove any and all enforcement efforts towards Y2k compliance. I'd
&gt;then buy up lots of precious metals, flee to the Bahamas, and watch gold
&gt;prices spike above $1000/oz while the financial markets melt.
&gt;
&gt;Just a touch of fantasy before Halloween..
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Rob Janes
&gt;
&gt;If I were Dictator I would tell people to start at least 5 years ago on the
&gt;Year 2000 problem.
&gt;
&gt;I used that approach and all the applications I am responsible for are in
&gt;good shape. It's a lot of fun watching people going into panic mode now
&gt;over the problem.
&gt;
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: harold.carruther
&gt;
&gt;1) Proclaim the every CEO must personally renovate and implement at least
&gt;1,000,000 lines of COBOL code per year or be sentenced to death by being
&gt;folded, spindled, and mutilated like a Hollerith card
&gt;
&gt;then
&gt;
&gt;2) Proclaim Bill Gates to be the official CEO for the remainder of the
&gt;world he doesn't already control
&gt;
&gt;then
&gt;
&gt;3) Double the annual quota
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Conor Brankin
&gt;
&gt;If I were dictator I would announce that the year 2000 was a virtual
&gt;concept, and that time shall revert to the year 1900, right after the year
&gt;1999.
&gt;
&gt;This would give the developers another 100 years to get it sorted out.
&gt;After all, we change an hour twice a year, why not a century one a
&gt;millenium.
&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;That's all folks... Hope you enjoyed them...
&gt;
&gt;Have fun!
