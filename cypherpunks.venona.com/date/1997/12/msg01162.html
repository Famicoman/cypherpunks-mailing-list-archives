&gt;&gt; There are probably as many weapons where this is true as there where
&gt;&gt; it is not. In general it makes most sense to check for safe condition
&gt;&gt; before and after loading.
&gt;
&gt;Would you be so kind as to give a specific example of a bolt action,
&gt;semi-automatic, or automatic rifle that can't be loaded on safe? I have
&gt;never seen a rifle that wouldn't allow this.

  Remington Model 8 semi-automatic rifle (circa 1905-1930+) there is one 
(high three digit serial number made in 1906) chambered in .35 Remington 
on the wall about 30 feet from where I am sitting. It's safety is right 
side mounted and not only blocks the trigger but locks the bolt forward 
both internally and externally by blocking track for the bolt handle, it 
must be off to draw the bolt back to load the internal five round 
pushdown magazine. The design was based on the original Browning patent 
for a semi-automatic rifle. I remember through the years seeing at least 
three other weapons with similar mechanisms but I cannot recall make and 
model save that one of the was a Remington of 1920's vintage.

&gt;A parallel pistol example would be nice too, if you're so inclined.

 I don't know of any pistols .... except that in the case of the 
ubiquitous military .45 (1911A1) while one can easily insert a magazine 
with the gun on safe, it isn't truly loaded til a round is chambered 
which involves coming out of safe to rack the slide .... as far as I am 
concerned the only 'safe' safety on a .45 is the half-cock position. I 
have seen a number of malfunctions of the thumb safety and the grip 
safety as well as the barrel disconnect safety.

 In another message someone commented on not dropping a .45 with the 
hammer back ... I have a friend in NJ who commanded another platoon in my 
recon company in Nam. He jumped down off a parapet and his .45 bounced 
out of his flak jacket pocket and went off putting a large hole in his 
foot (for which he earned the nickname "Quick Draw"). It had been in 
'condition 1' (full magazine inserted, round chambered, hammer at full 
cock, thumb safety on), but went off anyway. The armorer later said none 
of the parts seemed damaged or particularly worn, it just went off ... I 
am sure there's dozens more stories of loaded 45's going off when dropped.
