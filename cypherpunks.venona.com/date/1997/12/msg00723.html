&gt;&gt; I disagree that the best way to implement hashcash is solely via the SMTP
&gt;&gt;  mechanism.
&gt;
&gt;It is nicest to implement the blocking at the SMTP agent if this can
&gt;be done in a privacy preserving manner, because it reduces the
&gt;bandwidth consumption for users, and reduces the complexity of their
&gt;local software -- they only need to generate hashcash for outgoing
&gt;mail.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Almost any efficient hashcash mechanism will require some sort of history
&gt;&gt;  file, or "invited list," to allow mail lists and those we have corresponded
&gt;&gt;  with to continue to do so w/i having to supply hashcash each time.  This
&gt;&gt;  list contains information which might have privacy implications and so
&gt;&gt;  should not be stored at the ISP, which can be forced to reveal such info
&gt;&gt;  w/o the knowledge of the client.
&gt;
&gt;See my post to Bill Stewart with 
&gt;
&gt;	Subject: supeona immune postage free list
&gt;
&gt;I think you can construct ways to allow the ISP to reject messages
&gt;without postage, and to allow frequent users to be exempt, and to do
&gt;this such that there is no invited list which becomes a juicy target.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If 'open' list policies were changed so that anyone could post if they
&gt;&gt;  supplied enough hashcash for each mailing list recipient for their first 1
&gt;&gt;  or 2 posts, and thereafter no longer needed to supply hashcash (sort of
&gt;&gt;  minimum reputation capital), it might eliminate hit-and-run or throw-away
&gt;&gt;  account SPAMers without offering too high a hurdle to new or infrequent pos
&gt;&gt; ters.
&gt;
&gt;That is an interesting thought.  Well the interesting thought is that
&gt;it gives us a way to block spam at the list server, because a) the
&gt;spammer has to overcome the hurdle you described, and b) the list
&gt;operator could punish spammers who started spamming once getting over
&gt;the hurdle by blocking them.  The usual trick of switching to a
&gt;different address, or a remailer would not work because they would
&gt;still have to generate a new hashcash coin as the list operator could
&gt;block the coin.
&gt;
&gt;I would however think that a large denomiation coin made out to the
&gt;list server would make more sense than generating lots of coins for
&gt;all of the list subscribers.
&gt;
&gt;However there is a nasty side to the above, in that it encourages the
&gt;list operator to censor posts he considers spam.
&gt;
&gt;It would be simpler and I think tend to less encourage censorship to
&gt;introduce a third party filtering service such as Ray Arachellian's,
&gt;and the other one, which had an option to have only spam filtered out.
&gt;
&gt;At this moment in time the spam content on mailing lists I am on is
&gt;very low.  I get much more in email.
&gt;
&gt;Doubtless this would change when spammers discovered that email spam
&gt;is too CPU expensive to use.
&gt;
&gt;Also hashcash really doesn't work well for USENET.  NoCeM's are cool
&gt;things for USENET, a distributed ratings system, and I understand can
&gt;be configured to work for mailing lists also.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Since most popular email clients allow plug-ins (e.g. Eudora) or extensions
&gt;&gt;  via Java/ActiveX, providing hashcash functionality via a plug-in and the
&gt;&gt;  java generators you propose would provide a simple mechanism to test its
&gt;&gt;  effectiveness w/o needing to involve the IETF.  
&gt;
&gt;You can do a lot with local SMTP and POP3 proxies.
&gt;
&gt;There are a couple of java ones around.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know if there is code available to do SMTP and POP3 proxying?
&gt;
&gt;I am told by one subscriber to look at TIS firewall toolkits imap
&gt;program.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The shortcoming of a
&gt;&gt;  plug-in approach is that few newbies will know of it or install it and will
&gt;&gt;  therefore have to wait till its built into the new release of whatever
&gt;&gt;  client they use or until some or all of the features are supplied by their
&gt;&gt;  ISP, 
&gt;
&gt;Yes, this problem is the motivation for trying to work out ways that
&gt;as much as possible could happen at the ISP side for less technical
&gt;users, and even for technical users, I know few people are interested
&gt;to install new software.
&gt;
&gt;Also ISPs often seem more concerned about spam abuse than users.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; allowing those calling regulation to continue to blow their horns. 
&gt;&gt;  However, if after a successful cypherpunk beta we could get the major email
&gt;&gt;  client companies (Netscape, M$ and Qualcomm) to include our plug-ins with
&gt;&gt;  all their new updates and offer them for free download from their Web
&gt;&gt;  sites, it could quickly steal the CAUCE folk's thunder.
&gt;
&gt;It would be cool if we could pull that one off.
&gt;
&gt;Do we have anyone on list who is familiar with eurdora, qualcomm and
&gt;netscape plugins who would like to interface a hashcash library to
&gt;these systems?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone who can write java applets want to implement a java hashcash
&gt;library?  (Should be easy.. jdk1.1.3 includes a sha1 function ... I am
&gt;not sure if this is included with netscape 4 or not, but there are
&gt;also numerous sha1 native java codes around, www.systemics.com being
&gt;one).
