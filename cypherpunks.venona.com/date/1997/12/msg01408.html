&gt; This is largely a matter of personal preference (i.e., religious), but I'll
&gt; say why I think Wm. Geiger's claims are unconvincing.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Lets see how many years before winblows were there computers??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It may be hard to believe for some of the "youngsters" on the list but
&gt; &gt;people got quite a bit of work done before the fancy GUI's and the ever
&gt; &gt;insistent push to "upgrade" every six months by Micky$loth.
&gt; 
&gt; The real boom in productivity has to do with users not having to memorize
&gt; various command sequences for various programs.
&gt; 
&gt; What the Macintosh made popular (though I won't get into the dangerous
&gt; ground of saying it pioneered these ideas--see Note below) was the approach
&gt; of having a relatively consistent set of commands across many applications.
&gt; And with the commands visible in a menu bar.
&gt; 
&gt; (Note: The Symbolics and Xerox Lisp/Smalltalk machines I used in the early
&gt; 80s had similar features, with pop-up menus of commonly used commands. And,
&gt; of course, with even heavier use of object-oriented methodologies than the
&gt; Mac could afford to include. The idea of a unified, integrated environment
&gt; is an old one, going back at least to Doug Engelbart in the 60s, and
&gt; perhaps even further back. And the Bobrow book, "Design of Interactive
&gt; Programming Environments," laid out most of the features we now call "GUI."
&gt; Or some people call "GUI.")
&gt; 
&gt; The effect of this all is profound. It means that a manager or secretary or
&gt; whatever doesn't need to write down a bunch of funny commands for Wordstar,
&gt; or Emacs, or Autocad...he or she can "muddle through" just by going to the
&gt; "File" menu item to open files, save them, make copies, etc. Or to the
&gt; "Edit" menu item to make changes, cut and paste, alter fonts, whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Specialists in some particular program of course become proficient even
&gt; without a GUI or Menu-based system. But of course most GUI programs (Mac,
&gt; of course, and Windows, and most Unices) offer various keyboard shortcuts.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Wm. Geiger and others dismiss GUI or Menu interfaces as "training
&gt; wheels." Perhaps. But it's very useful to have such aids when dealing with
&gt; 5 or 10 or 30 different programs!
&gt; 
&gt; (I started out on a Data General Nova, got a Proc Tech Sol as my first PC,
&gt; then a VAX, then an IBM PC, then a Symbolics 3600 Lisp Machine, then a Mac,
&gt; and so on. With my PC, moving from one program to another was always
&gt; painful, and I had various keyboard overlays (remember those?) to help me
&gt; transition from the "Cmd-Shift-Backspace" to select a word in BlueWord
&gt; 1.00A to "Shift-Doubleclick" to do the same thing in SpreadSheet 1.5. Once
&gt; I got my Macintosh, this all ended. No more keyboard overlays...they
&gt; weren't needed.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;A well train and experienced secretary will be much more productive with a
&gt; &gt;text-mode WP with a good set of macro's and keyboard accelerators. A mouse
&gt; &gt;and a GUI is not only unnecessary but counter-productive.
&gt; 
&gt; Which of course explains why corporations are not using Windows or Macs!
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree strongly that any corporation is more productive, overall, with
&gt; such tools. Granted, a fast typist equipped with some special purpose text
&gt; entry system (we used to have Laniers and Wangs as our "secretary
&gt; engines"), but that typist will not be constrained by typing in a GUI
&gt; window!
&gt; 
&gt; But of course most companies, especially larger high tech companies, don't
&gt; even have secretaries to type and retype letters, memos, and reports.
&gt; Engineers, and even managers, and even very senior managers, type most of
&gt; their own stuff these days. (Or so all my friends in Silicon Valley assure
&gt; me.)
&gt; 
&gt; I started typing all my own technical papers into my own IBM PC back in
&gt; '83, using the first version of Microsoft Word. While it is true that I was
&gt; being paid to be a scientist, and not a typist, it was far faster for me to
&gt; write the papers on my PC, edit them, and so on, than to submit a longhand
&gt; (arghh!) copy to a secretary, finagle to get her to work on it, get it back
&gt; several days later, find numerous errors I had not put there, and even
&gt; missing sentences and paragraphs. And so on.
&gt; 
&gt; This experience of mine has been repeated millions of times in corporate
&gt; America. Even my old boss, Andy Grove, now types all of his correspondence,
&gt; which is now mostly e-mail. Or so he claims.
&gt; 
&gt; In this environment, where people at all levels are using multiple
&gt; programs--e-mail, word processing, drawing, spreadsheets, math programs,
&gt; graphing programs, Web browsers, and so on--it is much more efficient to
&gt; have an integrated environment, a common set of basic commands, a GUI.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I would take a good multi-threaded, multi-tasking, text mode system over
&gt; &gt;the drivile that keeps comming out of Redmond, WA. anyday.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the quality of lack of quality of word processors is grossly
&gt; overrated.
&gt; 
&gt; Most features are not used in ordinary writing. I write a *lot* of stuff,
&gt; and 99% of what I write is completely nondependent on bells and whistles in
&gt; most word processing programs.
&gt; 
&gt; (I could digress into discussing writing features I like to use for some
&gt; projects, such as MORE's outlining features, or page layout features I use
&gt; in FrameMaker. But 99% of my writing is now done for e-mail like this,
&gt; using the straightforward text tools of Eudora Pro.)
&gt; 
&gt; Most writing is done "typewriter style," with the ability to move words
&gt; around just lagniappe.  (And often dangerous lagniappe at that...most
&gt; errors creep in when people move words and sentences around, often leaving
&gt; them mismatching their surroundings in tense and awkwardly linking to often
&gt; leaving them mismatching often leaving them mismatching...see what I mean?)
&gt; 
&gt; Good writing comes from good writers, not from word processing programs.
&gt; Those who can't put a decent argument together will not find solace in some
&gt; "good multi-threaded, multi-tasking, text mode system."

This list was "supposed" to be about issues other than os bitches
and gun talk.

Think of your history.  [See efga.org before your history becomes your
past.]

I called vi the best to shut this shit up.  Let's talk about some (new)
real
cypherpunk shit.  Not TEOTWAWKI like misc.survivalism.  Ok, but give me
a break.

These are the projects with current priority:

1)  I am starting a credit-card swiping program for interested citizens
in
    Atlanta.  The vast majority don't know what is on their credit
cards.
    Although they do not technically "own" the cards, I feel they have a
right
    to know what the ABA format has to say about them.

    (No, I'm not advocating fraud, so don't even start with me.)

2)  I want to know anyone who knows anything about full-duplex soundcard
    programming under Linux.  Internet Telephony is fast opon us, do you
want
    to subscribe or design?  This is duplex Nautilus II.  Get in gear.

I have 1) completed.  How about 2)?  Any closet Nautilus users out
there?

We could code, or we could just type jerk off until the clock strikes 5
pm.
