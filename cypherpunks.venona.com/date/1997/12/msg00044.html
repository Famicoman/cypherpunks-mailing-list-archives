	&lt;sigh&gt; My apologies to Jonathan, the boyos in the Hills, and those
watching for the Choppers.  I wrote:

|&gt;	Could you please identify this "bank card company" by name, card,
nation, |&gt;etc. ?

	The vendor, Sensar, Inc. &lt;<A  HREF="http://www.sensar.com">http://www.sensar.com</A>&gt; is planning to
unveil the system at the Banking Administration Institute's conference in
New Orleans the day after tomorrow.   The company's version of the product
and its expected use is a little less conspiratorial than Jonathan's post
to C'punks -- but it more than suffices to force me to eat crow for my
scepticism and unwarranted sarcasm.

&gt;&gt;	IrisIdent is a biometric identification system that uses the unique
&gt;&gt;    patterns of the human iris to verify an individual's identity. Using a
&gt;&gt;    standard video camera, the system takes a picture of an individual's iris
&gt;&gt;    and compares it with a previously stored iris image. The result is a
&gt;&gt;rapid
&gt;&gt;    validation of the individual's identity. With an empirically determined
&gt;&gt;    crossover error rate of less than 1 error in 131,578 transactions, iris
&gt;&gt;    identification is more reliable and less intrusive than fingerprinting or
&gt;&gt;    retinal scanning. Its security cannot be bypassed or compromised.

&gt;&gt;    Pilot systems are available on a limited basis, with full production
&gt;&gt;    scheduled for later in 1997. In addition, Sensar is planning to launch
&gt;&gt;    follow-on applications for a wide range of financial applications,
&gt;&gt;such as
&gt;&gt;    new account openings, bank wire transfers and government services.
&gt;&gt;    Smart Camera is a future offering from Sensar. It will combine the same
&gt;&gt;    technology with a stand-alone (non-PC-based) camera to verify
&gt;&gt;    customer identification at point-of-sale locations, business
&gt;&gt;workstations,
&gt;&gt;    and home computers.

|&gt;	Without some explicit cite of a commercial entity -- or a reference
to some |&gt;"strip-'em-naked-with-electrons" Police R&amp;D group like the guys
at Rome AFB -- this |&gt;report sounds like another of those ID-Implant
fantasies circulated by the guys who |&gt;are bolting steel plate to their
screen doors and programming their backyard AA to |&gt;auto-target (a) Black
Helicopters (b) which are on low-level rapid approach (c) full |&gt;Oriental,
Arab, and Hispanic troopers (c) wearing Blue Helmets.

	The CNN news report (only a little less worrisome than Jonathan's
post) is at: <A  HREF="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9711/30/eyeball.id.ap/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9711/30/eyeball.id.ap/index.html</A>

|&gt;	Or, with further checking, could you confirm that is this just
another spicy
|&gt; rumor crafted to keep the boyos in the hills rubbing garlic into their
hollow-points
|&gt; with proper militia enthusiasm?  (Not that I don't enjoy a good tale to
wake up
|&gt; sleepy Computer Science undergrads, mind you...)

|&gt;	Up the Revolution,

|&gt;		              _Vin

	Jonathan Wienke &lt;JonWienk@ix.netcom.com&gt; warned us all:

&gt;I just heard that a bank card company has just released a program for using
&gt;photos of the iris in people's eyes as a biometric ID to replace people's
&gt;PIN codes for ATM / credit cards.  What I found really interesting is how
&gt;they plan to implement it.  As people use the ATM, they are photographed.
&gt;(Every ATM has a security camera.)  Over time, as people use the ATM, the
&gt;security camera images are composited to produce a high-quality image of
&gt;their irises, which is coded and placed in their account information.  Once
&gt;this is accomplished, when a card is inserted into the ATM and the security
&gt;camera gets an iris image that matches the account sufficiently closely,
&gt;the user can conduct transactions without entering the PIN code.  People
&gt;affected by this will merely receive a letter that under certain
&gt;circumstances, entering the PIN is no longer necessary, but this is not a
&gt;security problem.
&gt;
&gt;This scenario may not be a security problem, but it certainly poses a
&gt;privacy problem.  Given the frequency that the average Joe Sixpack uses the
&gt;ATM, it is only a matter of time before the government mandates a
&gt;nationwide eyeprint ID database to catch ATM and credit card theives, money
&gt;launderers, tax cheats, and other undesirables.  Perhaps the eyeprint could
&gt;even replace or supplement the SSN as the unique taxpayer ID key for tax
&gt;and other purposes.  Of course, given the fact that ATMs have had cameras
&gt;from the start, this theoretical eyeprint database could already be under
&gt;construction.  How's that for paranoia?  &gt;:-(
&gt;
&gt;Of course, there are a few ways to beat this, such as mirror sunglasses,
&gt;(which would only be useful while alternative credentials to eyeprint ID
&gt;are still available) and contact lenses, (which would have to be carefully
&gt;oriented so that the same side of the lens was always up, or the fact that
&gt;you are wearing contacts and are therefore a Suspicious Person™ would
&gt;become obvious to the system) and of course intraocular implants of various
&gt;types.  Of course if the implant's power-on LED gives your eyes a constant
&gt;Satanic red glow, you may be flagged as a Suspicious Person™ anyway.
