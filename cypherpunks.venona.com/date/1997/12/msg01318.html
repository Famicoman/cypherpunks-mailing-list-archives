   &gt;   &gt;Not allowed the admin of a one-way remailer who returned the required
   &gt;   &gt;token for posting to comp.org.cauce to post here; no explanation given
   &gt;   &gt;despite repeated requests.
   &gt;   
   &gt;   My understanding was that the Cracker remailer was allowed to post on some
   &gt;   CAUCE moderated thing, presumably the newsgroup.  I seem to recall that the
   &gt;   token was returned and posting capability had been verified.  Has something
   &gt;   changed?  Which remailer was it?

If I was wrong, nobody ever corrected me despite my
posting the complaint repeatedly to comp.org.cauce.

Look up the original posts at DejaNews:

They never answered. Not him, not me.

Speaking of problems: it's definite: the great attempt to
censor the Internet has begun in England.

Mainly Usenet is under attack: pics of mere nudity are being
deleted without any legal process whatsoever.

See my posts in comp.org.eff.talk ...

I've put two pics of nekked kids up at www.panix.com/~guy
as part of the "discussion".

They (Demon, UUNET, ...) are deleting both pics and
apparently text files too, and reporting them to the
police.

The Thought Police are here.
