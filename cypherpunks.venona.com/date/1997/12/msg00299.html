Sounds like a crock.  See the Snake-Oil FAQ.
This (mis)information is so full of nonsense I wouldn't touch the product
with rubber gloves.

&gt;Hello, all!  Back reading the list after a long hiatus.  Glad it's still as
&gt;good as ever.   Anyway, thought I'd appeal to the collective brain trust as
&gt;this question is over my head.  Please "cc" me directly since I'm on the
&gt;filtered cypherpunk list.
&gt;
&gt;I just downloaded Encrypted Magic Folders--a program that hides Windows 95
&gt;folders and then encrypts them to prevent a disk utility from revealing
&gt;their content.  In their help file, they try to answer the question "How
&gt;Secure is it?"--and, of course, they say *very*, but I can't tell if this is
&gt;so or if they're just blowing smoke.  Particularly, their claim that key
&gt;size doesn't matter.  (My mom taught me size always matters... )   If
&gt;someone with a stronger cryptography background than me could take a look at
&gt;this and let me know, I would greatly appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

&gt;* How Secure is it?
&gt;
&gt;    EMF's encryption offers good protection and excellent speed.  It
&gt;    hasn't been broken yet.  It is, as far as we know, exportable.  THERE
&gt;    IS NO BACKDOOR.  Should you forget your password there is nothing we
&gt;    can do to decrypt your encrypted files.
&gt;
&gt;    Quite a few people ask us how big EMF's key size is.  They've learned
&gt;    from other encryption programs that the bigger the key the stronger
&gt;    the encryption.  This really doesn't apply to EMF.
&gt;
&gt;    We developed our own encryption instead of using a standard because
&gt;    we wanted EMF to be able to decrypt at the byte level.  In this way
&gt;    we only need to decrypt/encrypt the data your programs require and
&gt;    not the entire file.
&gt;
&gt;    In theory, because we decrypt at the byte level, the biggest key we
&gt;    could use would be 8 bits - which is a joke.  So instead of
&gt;    decrypting every hunk of data using the same key, as most other
&gt;    encryption programs do, we developed an algorithm to vary the key
&gt;    based on the data's location within the file.  In this way we get
&gt;    both high security and high speed.  We are trying to patent EMF's
&gt;    encryption method.
&gt;
&gt;    Having said all that, truth is, most encryption isn't "cracked" by
&gt;    breaking the algorithm, it's done by guessing the password.  Brute
&gt;    guessing of passwords tends to level the playing field tremendously.
&gt;    We actually have an advantage because we aren't an established
&gt;    standard.  Because we're small and relatively obscure chances are no
&gt;    one will take the effort to write a password guessing program (which
&gt;    incidentally would violate copyright and intellectual property laws.)
&gt;    Even if someone were to go thru all this effort we could easily
&gt;    change the encryption method for the next update.
&gt;
&gt;    If we used an established encryption method like DES or Blowfish then
&gt;    your files would probably have to be fully decrypted when opened,
&gt;    would exist on disk as unencrypted while you're using them, and then
&gt;    would need to be encrypted when closed.  This has multiple
&gt;    disadvantages.  First, if your computer shuts down while you have
&gt;    "encrypted" files open, then those files would be unencrypted.  This
&gt;    doesn't happen with EMF as your encrypted files are always encrypted
&gt;    as stored on disk.  The second disadvantage is that it slows things
&gt;    down tremendously.  As an example, let's say you retrieve your email
&gt;    and your email program needs to add today's message to the end of
&gt;    your 3MB email file.  If we used a standard encryption method
&gt;    requiring the decryption of the file before use then the entire 3 MB
&gt;    file would have to be decrypted, your 300 byte message added to the
&gt;    end and then the entire file encrypted again.  With EMF, no
&gt;    decryption would need to take place, and the only data needing
&gt;    encryption would be the 300 byte message.  MUCH faster.  Around
&gt;    20,000 times faster in this example!
&gt;
&gt;    If you still think you'd like to see us use a standard encryption
&gt;    method like DES or Blowfish, or have any other suggestions, let us
&gt;    know and we will consider your input in future updates
&gt;
