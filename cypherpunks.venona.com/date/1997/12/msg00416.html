This article has lost a few very critical lines,
making it look far worse than it really is.

Network Associates was _not_ formerly known as the
Key Recovery Alliance.  They were formerly known as
McAfee Associates.  McAfee had been a member of the
KRA, but has since withdrawn.  Go see PGP's home page.
And Phil's comments about user consent don't mean that
users _should_ be forced to consent -- viewed in context, 
they mean that users shouldn't have their keys or
messages escrowed without their consent,
and the escrow features should require consent.

Furthermore, peer-reviewed encryption isn't dead -
the OpenPGP encryption standard is being developed,
bringing PGP to an open standards process.

&gt;Subject: IP: (OT) Cloud Over Future of PGP
&gt;
&gt;Seems like the days of peer-reviewed encryption
&gt;software may be numbered.  Just trust Us.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
&gt;Barry Skaggs
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cloud Over Future of Pretty Good Privacy
&gt;     The Price of Key Recovery
&gt;
&gt;Following Monday's US$35 million cash
&gt;acquisition of PGP by Network Associates,
&gt;the man who once testified before the
&gt;Senate that key recovery could "strengthen
&gt;the hand of a police state" now works for a
&gt;company that actively promotes it. 
&gt;
&gt;Reaction from e-privacy activists was swift
&gt;and harsh. 
&gt;"The users of PGP can no longer rely on the
&gt;credibility of Phil Zimmermann to ensure that
&gt;the product is everything that they've been
&gt;promised it's been previously," said Dave
&gt;Banisar, attorney for the Electronic Privacy
&gt;Information Center and co-author of The
&gt;Electronic Privacy Papers 
&gt;
&gt;Network Associates, formerly known as
&gt;the Key Recovery Alliance, an organization
&gt;that lobbies Congress for key recovery that
&gt;would grant law enforcement agencies
&gt;back-door access to private encrypted
&gt;communications. 
&gt;
&gt;Network Associates and other companies
&gt;support key recovery because it would allow
&gt;them to export strong crypto software
&gt;without bothering to make a separate
&gt;nonrecoverable version for the domestic
&gt;market. The Commerce Department forbids
&gt;export of the strongest available encryption
&gt;without elaborate promises from
&gt;manufacturers to develop key recovery
&gt;features. Thus many companies are forced
&gt;to develop both export and domestic
&gt;versions of their software, each with
&gt;differing crypto strengths. 
&gt;
&gt;But Zimmermann, a pioneer of strong
&gt;encryption, has spent years crusading
&gt;against key recovery, calling it an invasion
&gt;of privacy. And the most recent release of
&gt;PGP's encryption software allows users to
&gt;disable key recovery. 
&gt;
&gt;"People should give their consent to use
&gt;[recovery]," Zimmermann said. When asked
&gt;whether future versions of the package will
&gt;retain that option, Zimmermann replied,
&gt;"Certainly, as long as I have anything to say
&gt;about it." 
&gt;
&gt;Zimmermann's new title at Network
&gt;Associates is "fellow," but he declined to
&gt;comment on exactly what authority and
&gt;responsibility that confers. Meanwhile, Phil
&gt;Dunkelberger, PGP's former president and
&gt;CEO, was named general manager of
&gt;Network Associates' Total Network
&gt;Security Division. 
&gt;
&gt;"It's going to take some time to figure things
&gt;out," said Zimmermann. 
&gt;
&gt;EPIC's Banisar was less diplomatic and
&gt;postulated that Zimmermann's new title
&gt;reflected a clash of values between him and
&gt;Network Associates on key recovery. 
&gt;
&gt;"We have a number of fellows here, and
&gt;they are usually unpaid volunteers," Banisar
&gt;said. 
&gt;
&gt;"It will require a fundamental examination by
&gt;human rights groups and others about
&gt;whether any newer versions of PGP are
&gt;truly trustworthy," said Banisar. 
&gt;
&gt;Network Associates could not be reached
&gt;for comment.
