Dear Friend:

   Earlier this week I sent you this very
same letter and since I have not heard
from you I imagined either it didn't 
get delivered or you accidentally hit 
"delete" on it. Or you simply just 
haven't gotten around it.

   I don't think you want to wait around 
much longer. Especially if like other 
friends of mine and business relationships,
you are interested in 
         
        MULTIPLYING SUBSTANTIALLY 

(and in a very short time) a very 
small investment.

So here again, is a copy of my letter.

   Today I write you to share one of the most simple 
and beneficial investments I found in the
last months. I waited effectively several months
to verify the incidence of my decision and truly,
I am so glad of this one, that I decided
to share it with a selected handful of people.

   I was proposed to invest $145 minimum 
and $485 maximum to receive a basic 
$1300 in the first months with a program,
by sharing it with a very few friends.
 (I took the $485 option).

   Conclusion: not only didn't I have to wait
one year to see a 800% of return on my 
investment, but I had the surprise to 
receive this amount  
      SEVERAL TIMES BY MONTH.
It seems incredible, but it's true.

   The American Company offering this program
is not only serious, but I could personally
speak with the President and the CPA and 
they have been reliable for the few friends
I shared the program with.

   So, if I awakened your interest just a 
little bit, this is the moment and 
opportunity to give a look to the complete
information pulling the
 
     FAX ON DEMAND #  716-720-2106

or visiting the following WEBSITE: 

      <A  HREF="http://peopleschoice.com/STP/home.html">http://peopleschoice.com/STP/home.html</A>

   And remember, do as I did by considering
this opportunity as an investment, and,
applying the program, it will give you
the most secure and fantastic yield you 
can find.  
        FOR ONLY $145 to $485.

   Just try it, contemplating that the risk is 
around zero and share it with two or 
three of your best friends just after 
you applied. 

   To participate, you must 
indicate a sponsor number. I would be 
glad if you used mine, it is: 
               # 983 
registered under the name of  
my corporation, 
            WOOSTER CORP.

   So don't hesitate on this opportunity
my friend. You are getting today one 
of the most safe and simple ways to 
increase a very little capital SEVERAL TIMES.

Just try it as I did.

Friendly

Jean Marc Gelot

CEO / WOOSTER CORP.
