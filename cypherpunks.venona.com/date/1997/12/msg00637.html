Hi,

Would you gentlemen be so kind as to take your personal and apparently petty
squabble elsewhere?

Thanks for your prompt help with this matter.

&gt; &gt; :&gt; That must mean that I'm harassing you as well, right?
&gt; &gt; :
&gt; &gt; :That is exactly my objection to the tactics of Gary Burnore and the DataBasix
&gt; &gt; :gang.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; You've posted no evidence tactics were EVER used.  Naturally, you expect
&gt; &gt; everyone to believe you and naturally, a few like sam will.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't expect anybody to "believe me".  That's why I have posted a URL to a 
&gt; post by Jeff Burchell in which he outlines your tactics, such as your demand
&gt; that he turn over his logs to you, which would have had the effect of 
&gt; compromising the remailer's security and eroding confidence in it.  Is that
&gt; really what you wanted?  For remailer users to distrust the remailer net and
&gt; stop using it?  You have still not explained why you wanted the remailer logs 
&gt; and what you intended to do with the names and addresses contained therein.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; : He calls
&gt; &gt; :the kind of discussion that the three of us are engaging in "harassment", and
&gt; &gt; :has even, upon occasion, accused posts critical of him of constituting
&gt; &gt; :"libel".
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; You have from time to time constituted libel. 
&gt; 
&gt; Would you care to prove that?  Saying something that Gary Burnore or Belinda
&gt; Bryan don't like is not "libel".  To be "libel" a statement must be both
&gt; DEFAMATORY as well as FALSE.  While being reminded of your own actions
&gt; several months ago might prove to be embarassing, it's not libel.
&gt; 
&gt; What was really laughable was when your fellow DataBasix staff member Billy
&gt; McClatchie accused another anonymous usenet poster of "slander"!  He must have 
&gt; gone to the same law school as Belinda. &lt;g&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's not abuse.  Your
&gt; &gt; harassment is only that, harassment.  The ABUSE is UCE-Baiting.  The fact that
&gt; &gt; some remailer operators are now taking measures to prevent UCE-Baiting is
&gt; &gt; evidence not only that the problem existed, but that something COULD be done
&gt; &gt; about it.
&gt; 
&gt; That's not what Jeff's post said.  It said that your pretext for demanding his
&gt; user logs was an "unflattering post", not all this nonsense about "spam baiting"
&gt; that you invented later.
&gt; 
&gt; My "harassment"?  You keep whining about my so-called "harassment", but you
&gt; have yet to prove ANY of it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; :Actually, Gary may unwittingly prove to be a "friend" of remailers, yet.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Unwittingly?  I was never NOT a friend of remailers.  YOU on the otherhand may
&gt; &gt; simply be unwittingly trying to shut them down.  I happen to believe you're
&gt; &gt; doing it on purpose, but maybe, just maybe, you have no clue what you're
&gt; &gt; doing.
&gt; 
&gt; What would people have to be smoking (and inhaling) to believe that nonsense?
&gt; Anyone who demands that a remailer operator violate the privacy of all of his
&gt; users to placate one chronic whiner is no "friend" to remailers.  Such 
&gt; "friends" they can do without.  What do you think it would have done for the 
&gt; reputation of remailer security if Jeff had actually kept logs and had turned 
&gt; them over to individuals such as you and Belinda?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you really think it would be more "pro remailer" to just pretend that your
&gt; attempt to attempt to obtain sendmail logs from the Huge Cajones Remailer 
&gt; didn't occur?
&gt; 
&gt; Of the two of us, I'm the one that admits to actually USING remailers.  For me
&gt; to try to shut them down would make no sense.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you don't like being called the anon asshole, stop being an asshole.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't like being called anti-privacy, stop being anti-privacy.
