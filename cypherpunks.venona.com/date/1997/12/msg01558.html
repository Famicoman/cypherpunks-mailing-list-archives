 The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:
 
   $5.00 cash
   * The name and number of the report they are ordering

 To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours! This is the electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! 
 
 FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
 BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!
 
 &gt;I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S
 This is what you MUST do:
 
 1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).
      
      *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE 
         REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
         RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS(in case of a problem) to the person whose 
         name appears on the list next to the report.
   
      *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four
         reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can save them
         on your computer and resell them.
 
      *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports. 
          Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send 
          to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.
 
 2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
      to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is
      instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out on the
      majority of your profits. Once you  understand the way this works, you'll 
      also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method 
      has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.
 
     a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.
 
     b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address 
          under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the one that 
          was there down to REPORT #2.  
 
     c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
          REPORT #3.  
 
     d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
          REPORT #4.  
 
     e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
          the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.
 
Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!
&gt;
 3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save 
      it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this 
      letter.
   
 4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
      WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
      and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another
      avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.  
      You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you
      can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. 
      BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!
 
 5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report
      they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
      ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out,
      with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't
      advertise until they receive the report!
 
 AVAILABLE REPORTS

 Notes:
 -  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT 
 -  ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS  MAIL

 HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU MONEY
 

 Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level.
 (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.)
 Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  
Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
 
 1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................................$50
 2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
 3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
 4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...&lt;U&gt;$50,000&lt;/U&gt;
                                                    THIS TOTALS        -----------&gt;$55,550
 Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.
  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants THINK ABOUT IT!
 
 Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20).
 You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!
REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!
 About 50,000 new people get online every month!
 
TIPS FOR SUCCESS

  *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow 
      the directions accurately.
 
  *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when 
     the orders start coming in because:
 
     When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
     product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title
     18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
     also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state 
     that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."
 
  *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
 
  *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
     instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!
 
  *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
 
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE

 Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
 If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do. 
 Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders fo
r REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do. 
 Once you have received 100 or more orders for
 REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!
 
 THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
 
 Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. 
 You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.
  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again! 
 There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!
 
 NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name, 
 how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency)
 for free help and answers to questions.
 Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.
