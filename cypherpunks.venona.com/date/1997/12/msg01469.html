Tired of NOT making money on the internet?

Did you REALLY believe that ALL you had to do was:

Put up a web page somewhere in Cyberspace with beautiful graphics,
the latest Java and some frames;

Advertise in a few free classifieds;

Act like an expert in newsgroups; since you're not 
supposed to advertise in them;

And, customers were going to beat a path to your door.

If you believed that-
BOY, have I got some swampland in Florida for you!

If you want to make money on the internet,
YOU'D better be PROACTIVE!

YOU'D better go after business like you MEAN IT!

YOU'D better send some E-MAIL - Lots of it!

And YOU'D better tell your story as much as you can,
as often as you can,
to whomever you can!

WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD.

Bulk e-mail works!

If you know how to write an ad,
identify a need, and fullfill it with your product,
you can make money on the Internet
EVEN on a very limited budget.

This form of advertising has been proven MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
than other forms of advertising because people read their e-mail.
And, the message will wait in the recipient's e-mail box until it is
read. Your message is SEEN not buried!

Your business deserves a piece of the fastest growing industry in the
U.S.- THE HOME-BASED BUSINESS INDUSTRY ( $427 billion in annual
sales).  Internet sales are projected to be over $10 billion by the 
year 2000, up from $300 million in 1994.

We've got the addresses YOU need.

A Web site alone, posting through newsgroups and registering with a 
few search engines while placing a few classifieds just won't work.

What good is a Web page no one knows is there?

Bulk e-mailing is the lowest-cost method of generating qualified sales
leads,
On average, a solo direct (snail) mail promotion would cost around
$500.00
per thousand, whereas bulk e-mail costs pennies per thousand. No
known form of media advertising can compete with the low cost of bulk e-mail.

Our e-mail lists are maintained on state-of-the-art computers and are
updated daily to assure you the very latest names for your 
mailings. 

Bulk Email Works!!

Put your sales message in front of responsive buyers. Our lists are
compiled from active and willing on-line purchasers and
entrepreneurs. THESE ARE SERIOUS CUSTOMERS LOOKING FOR SERIOUS OFFERS!

addresses
