On Sun, 14 Dec 1997 at 11:29:25 -0600 (CST) Jim Choate once again 
showed his clueless side (yes, he does have another side) wrote:

&gt;&gt; Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek, one of the earliest economic 
&gt;&gt; theorists of the role of knowledge, would have recognized 
&gt;&gt; the problem. Organizations overcome such difficulties 
&gt;&gt; through compromise and negotiation, or they break down. 
&gt;&gt; But society as a whole can avoid the "knowledge problem" 
&gt;&gt; only at the cost of stamping out individuality.

&gt; It's a real pitty Hayek never tried 'cooperation' instead 
&gt; of 'compromise'.

It's a real pity Choate never tried reading before spewing.
It would appear poor Jim doesn't have a clear idea of
Hayek, and has difficulty distinguishing between any of the
several voices used, and in filling in thin context. This
is another case like Jim's confusion over which "Gates" Tim
was referring to in a recent post.

&gt; Oh, the short-short sightedness of ego and tryanny.

Well, ego anyway.

&gt; What is the line of reasoning that the *only* solution for 
&gt; society is to stamp out individuality? Sounds more like 
&gt; wishful thinking from some brain-dead drone with no 
&gt; imagination or respect for others.

Sounds like you should do some reading before you mouth off.

&gt; Perhaps he should have stuck with economics and kept away 
&gt; from sociology.

Perhaps you should have stuck with programming and kept away
from political commentary. Scratch that -- programming
requires a high degree of ability to deal with reality as
it is, not as one mistakenly sees it.

Your assignment is to read The Road to Serfdom and submit a
5,000 word essay to the c-p list on the subject of Hayek,
the brain-dead drone. Following that you will be allowed to
submit a 20,000 word essay on Jim Choate, the often-clueless
and illiterate half-wit motor mouth.
