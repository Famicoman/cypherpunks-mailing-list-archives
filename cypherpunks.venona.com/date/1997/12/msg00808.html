One Hundred Fifth Congress

United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION

Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the seventh day of
January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven 

An Act 

To amend the provisions of titles 17 and 18, United States Code, to provide
greater copyright protection by amending criminal copyright infringement
provisions, and for other purposes. 

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

States Code, is amended by inserting after the undesignated paragraph
relating to the term `display', the following new paragraph:

          `The term `financial gain' includes receipt, or expectation of
receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted
works.'.

     (b) CRIMINAL OFFENSES- Section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code,
is amended to read as follows:

means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1
or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than
$1,000,

     shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18, United

                    (ii) by striking `with a retail value of more than
$2,500' and inserting `which have a total retail value of more than
$2,500'; and

          (3) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (e) and

          `(B) holders of intellectual property rights in such works; and

          `(C) the legal representatives of such producers, sellers, and
holders.'.

section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections 2319, 2319A,
