&gt; Right to Privacy for Sale in Cyberspace; SynData Technologies Inc. 
&gt; Speaks Out  Against Key Recovery
&gt;
&gt; Cedar Grove, N.J. -- SynData Technologies Inc., a provider of encryption 
&gt; software solutions, released a statement today condemning Network 
&gt; Associates Inc. for supporting the government's key recovery program. 
&gt; Network Associates recently purchased Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
&gt; PGP had historically been opposed to key recovery. 
&gt;
&gt; "It is time to seriously consider the threat that Network Associates poses
&gt; to the individual's constitutional right to privacy," said David
Romanoff, CEO 
&gt; of SynData Technologies Inc. "While Network Associates claims to protect
&gt; privacy in cyberspace, they have actually traded our right to privacy for a 
&gt; shot at increased revenues overseas by supporting the key recovery program. 
&gt; The slippery slope has begun right under our noses. It's time to challenge 
&gt; both the government and companies who support the government's key
&gt; recovery program before it is too late." 
&gt;
&gt; "The government's key recovery program is a complete violation of the
&gt; individual's right to privacy and, in fact, compromises of the system are 
&gt; already taking place. This shows that key escrow is an untenable policy," 
&gt; said Bruce Schneier, one of the world's leading authorities on encryption 
&gt; and author of the book "Applied Cryptography". "SynData is paving the
&gt; way for other software developers by taking a stand in opposition to the 
&gt; government and companies like Network Associates."

Everyone should keep in mind that John McAfee very well knows on which side
of his bread it is buttered--  McAfee has made his fortune on the
site-licenses for government use of his anti-virus product.  U.S. Customs
alone liceneses 17,000+ copies.  Is anyone kidding themselves about which
side of GAK and Key Escrow McAfee will come down on?  I have never bought
into any of the conspiranauts BS about PGP backdoors as long as PZ was
involved with it but I will certainly assume it is to be a "given" with PGP
in the hands of McAfee.
