Greetings:

        Although not specifically on crypto, we have a draft book on my web
site that might be of interest to readers of the list.  The book will be
published by the Brookings Institution in 1998, and is entitled "None of
Your Business: World Data Flows, Electronic Commerce, and the European
Privacy Directive."  The focus of the book is on the effect of the European
Data Protection Directive, which goes into effect in October 1998.

        The book is available from www.osu.edu/units/law/swire.htm.

        I've been around this list long enough to know how much many
contributors hate laws and regulations that govern how data is supposed to
flow from one place to another.  The European privacy laws are real and
quite stringent in many respects, so you may, despite your visceral
distaste, want to learn more about them.

        Of particular interest to people here may be Chapter Four: "The
Tension Between Data Protection and Modern Information Technologies."  I am
already aware of a couple of glitches in the draft, such as the definition
of an Intranet.  But I would be very interested in comments on this or other
chapters.

        To give a sense of the book's coverage, I am enclosing the draft
table of contents.

        Thanks for any comments you may have.  I'm doing a big rewrite
during the next several weeks.
