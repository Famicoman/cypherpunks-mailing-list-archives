&gt;Microsoft Blackmails Foreign Companies
&gt;Switch To Microsoft, and Your Legal Problems Will Disappear
&gt;
&gt;Microsoft appears to be using the Business Software Alliance (BSA) to
&gt;blackmail foreign companies into making exclusive deals with Microsoft,
&gt;reports Mother Jones magazine in a story released last night on the MoJo
&gt;Wire, Mother Jones' Web site:
&gt;
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.motherjones.com/mother_jones/JF98/burstein.html">http://www.motherjones.com/mother_jones/JF98/burstein.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;When the BSA tracks down companies using software pirated from its
&gt;various members, reports Mother Jones investigative reporter Rachel
&gt;Burstein, the offender is offered a simple out: Switch to Microsoft
&gt;products and your legal problems will disappear.
&gt;
&gt;* In 1995 the BSA caught Antel, Uruguay's national telephone company,
&gt;using unlicensed Microsoft, Novell, and Symantec software. Ricardo
&gt;Tascenho, Antel's information technology manager, told Mother Jones the
&gt;company settled the matter by signing a "special agreement" with
&gt;Microsoft to replace all its software with Microsoft products. According
&gt;to Eduardo DeFreitas, the BSA's lawyer in Uruguay, Microsoft's Uruguay
&gt;manager, Tomas Blatt, instructed him to drop the suit so that Microsoft
&gt;and Antel could "work out a deal for the future."
&gt;
&gt;* Felipe Yungman, Novell's manager of security for Argentina, says
&gt;Novell's investigations also indicate that the BSA has set up sweetheart
&gt;deals for Microsoft there. "Companies or government offices had to, as a
&gt;condition [that the BSA] forgive them of piracy, replace Novell products
&gt;with Microsoft products," he told Mother Jones.
&gt;
&gt;* In 1996, when the BSA sued the Australian shipping company Toll
&gt;Holdings for piracy, the suit alleged that Toll illegally used copies of
&gt;programs made by Lotus, Novell, Symantec, and Microsoft. According to
&gt;Martin Dunne, Toll's chief information technology officer, other than
&gt;keeping Symantec's anti-virus software, they only buy Microsoft now. A
&gt;Novell official told Mother Jones that Toll "offered to legalize on all
&gt;Microsoft products if [the BSA] dropped the suit." Both the BSA and Toll
&gt;deny any impropriety.
&gt;
&gt;* In Slovenia, where 96 percent of all software is pirated, Microsoft's
&gt;country manager, Aaron Marko, is also head of the BSA office. Marko says
&gt;that because enforcement is difficult in the country's court system, he
&gt;offers discounted
&gt;
&gt;Microsoft software to companies caught pirating by the BSA. Microsoft
&gt;denies that the BSA acts solely on its behalf. But officials at
&gt;Novell and Lotus told Mother Jones that they will stop actively
&gt;participating in the BSA's programs in Asia and Latin America by the
&gt;beginning of 1998.
&gt;
&gt;Greg Wrenn, senior corporate counsel for Adobe, says his company has
&gt;stayed with the BSA, but he acknowledges Microsoft's upper hand: "If an
&gt;attorney does Microsoft work and BSA work and never hears from another
&gt;company besides Microsoft, he's going to do the work for the guy who's
&gt;in his office every week."
&gt;
&gt;The BSA story is part of a five-part cover package on Microsoft featured
&gt;in Mother Jones' January/February issue.

&gt;Full Article:
&gt;
&gt;Overseas Invasion
&gt;by Rachel Burstein
&gt;
&gt;Like Coke, Nike, and the tobacco industry before it, Microsoft now has
&gt;to
&gt;hook new consumers abroad. But the company has discovered a way to bully
&gt;foreign companies into buying Microsoft-and only Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt;In 1995 Antel, the national telephone company of Uruguay, was caught
&gt;pirating $100,000 worth of unlicensed software programs from Microsoft,
&gt;Novell, and Symantec. Antel was nabbed by the Business Software
&gt;Alliance, a
&gt;trade association that partly acts as a global bounty hunter for the
&gt;software industry. The BSA's lawyers in Uruguay quickly filed suit.
&gt;
&gt;But instead of waiting for a ruling on the case, the BSA abruptly
&gt;dropped
&gt;the suit in the fall of 1997. The BSA receives funding from most of the
&gt;top
&gt;software companies but appears to be most heavily funded by Microsoft.
&gt;And,
&gt;according to Antel's information technology manager, Ricardo Tascenho,
&gt;the
&gt;company settled the matter by signing a "special agreement" with
&gt;Microsoft
&gt;to replace all of its software with Microsoft products.
&gt;
&gt;The BSA's lawyer in Uruguay, Eduardo DeFreitas, supports Tascenho's
&gt;story:
&gt;"Microsoft told me to stop working on the case because they would write
&gt;an
&gt;agreement with Antel." DeFreitas says Microsoft's Uruguay manager, Tomas
&gt;Blatt, instructed him to drop the suit so that Microsoft could "work out
&gt;a
&gt;deal for the future." Blatt refused to answer questions about the
&gt;settlement, claiming, "I don't have any information about the Antel
&gt;caseä.
&gt;You should call
&gt;BSA in Uruguay-Eduardo DeFreitas."
&gt;
&gt;Antel's situation suggests that when  the BSA cracks down on piracy
&gt;overseas, it's Bill Gates who turns out to be the pirate.
&gt;Representatives
&gt;from rival firms complain that Microsoft is abusing its power within the
&gt;BSA to speed its global dominance.
&gt;
&gt;Microsoft denies that the BSA acts solely on its behalf. "I am not aware
&gt;of
&gt;any instance where that has happened," says Microsoft attorney Brad
&gt;Smith.
&gt;And the BSA dismisses the charges; spokeswoman Diane Smiroldo calls them
&gt;"hard to believe." But officials at Novell and Lotus confirm that by
&gt;January, both companies will have stopped actively participating in the
&gt;BSA's programs in Asia and Latin America. Novell says these allegations
&gt;played a part in its decision; Lotus refuses to comment. Such concerns
&gt;are also among the reasons Netscape is reluctant to join the BSA, says
&gt;Netscape attorney Peter Harter.
&gt;
&gt;The accusations aren't just limited to Uruguay:
&gt;
&gt;* Felipe Yungman, Novell's manager of security for Argentina, says he
&gt;and
&gt;another staffer at Novell discovered, while pursuing their own
&gt;investigation for the company, that the BSA was setting up sweetheart
&gt;deals
&gt;for Microsoft. "Companies or government offices had to, as a condition
&gt;[that the BSA] forgive them of piracy, replace Novell products with
&gt;Microsoft products," he says.
&gt;
&gt;were bullied by Microsoft, saying that he is trying to convince them to
&gt;come forward. "Most of the companies don't want to get involved," he
&gt;explains. "They think they need Microsoft. You cannot oblige them to
&gt;testify."
&gt;
&gt;Mario Tucci, Novell's country manager for Latin America, supports
&gt;Yungman's allegations. "If you call BSA, you will reach Microsoft," he
&gt;says. "They shield Microsoft's actions with the BSA name. It's bad for
&gt;us
&gt;and [for] the software industry."
&gt;
&gt;* In 1996, when the BSA sued the Australian shipping company Toll
&gt;Holdings
&gt;for piracy, BSA lawyer Charles Gonsalves, of the Sydney-based firm of
&gt;Mallesons Stephen Jaques, oversaw the case.
&gt;
&gt;"I generally handle cases for both Microsoft and the BSA," Gonsalves
&gt;told
&gt;Mother Jones.
&gt;
&gt;But while the suit alleged that Toll illegally used copies of programs
&gt;made
&gt;by Lotus, Novell, Symantec, and Microsoft, Martin Dunne, Toll's chief
&gt;information technology officer, says the company settled by paying fines
&gt;to
&gt;only Symantec and Microsoft. And, Dunne says, other than keeping
&gt;Symantec's
&gt;anti-virus software, the company has made a significant change: Toll
&gt;only
&gt;buys Microsoft now.
&gt;
&gt;According to a Novell official, Toll "offered to legalize on all
&gt;Microsoft
&gt;products if [the BSA] dropped the suit." Both the BSA and Toll deny any
&gt;impropriety. While a written agreement between Toll and Gonsalves does
&gt;exist, neither party would reveal the terms of the settlement. When
&gt;Gonsalves was asked if Microsoft ever paid for his handling of BSA
&gt;cases,
&gt;he chuckled and said, "That's a confidential matter."
&gt;
&gt;* In Slovenia, where 96 percent of all software is pirated, the head of
&gt;the
&gt;BSA office, Aaron Marko, is also Microsoft's country manager. Marko says
&gt;that because enforcement is difficult in the country's court system, he
&gt;offers discounted Microsoft software to companies caught pirating by the
&gt;BSA. Does Marko see this as a conflict of interest, since he also
&gt;supposedly represents other software firms? "BSA is trying to find the
&gt;pirate. Then it is a question of marketing and product awareness to see
&gt;who
&gt;will get the legal market share," he says. When asked which BSA members
&gt;have local subsidiaries that do local marketing, Marko says only
&gt;Microsoft
&gt;and Oracle, which is not a direct Microsoft competitor.
&gt;
&gt;These allegations "raise questions as to whether the BSA serves the
&gt;interest of its members or whether it serves its dominant member," says
&gt;James Love, director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology.
&gt;And
&gt;for the foreign companies, he says, "these seem to be stories of
&gt;blackmail."
&gt;
&gt;The BSA employs a team of more than 100 lawyers and investigators to
&gt;find
&gt;cases of software piracy-a crime it says costs the industry $11 billion
&gt;a
&gt;year. The BSA says it catches "thousands of cases a year," many through
&gt;its
&gt;55 piracy hotlines, the most famous of which urges employees to "Nail
&gt;Your
&gt;Boss" by calling.
&gt;
&gt;While the BSA won't release its funding details, it does say that money
&gt;comes from membership dues, which are based on each company's software
&gt;revenues. This is one way in which Microsoft dominates the BSA:
&gt;Microsoft's
&gt;annual revenues, for example, are eight times that of Novell, its
&gt;largest
&gt;rival.
&gt;
&gt;In the future, Novell and Lotus say they will use their own in-house
&gt;resources for anti-piracy efforts in Asia and Latin America.
&gt;
&gt;But other BSA members, while concerned about Microsoft's role in the
&gt;organization, aren't quite willing to go their own way. Greg Wrenn,
&gt;senior
&gt;corporate counsel for Adobe, says his company has stayed with the BSA
&gt;despite having had some uneasy experiences with Microsoft. For example,
&gt;Wrenn says, the Microsoft attorneys who worked for the BSA refrained
&gt;from
&gt;going after big Microsoft clients caught pirating Adobe products-until
&gt;Adobe prodded them.
&gt;
&gt;Wrenn says Adobe will stay in the BSA, pressuring the organization to
&gt;play
&gt;fair. But he acknowledges Microsoft's upper hand. "If an attorney does
&gt;Microsoft work and BSA work and never hears from another company besides
&gt;Microsoft, he's going to do the work for the guy who's in his office
&gt;every
&gt;week," Wrenn says.
