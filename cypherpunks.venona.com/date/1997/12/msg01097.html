&gt;&gt; Mainstream Loudoun, a local group, and 11 other
&gt;&gt; plaintiffs are challenging Loudoun County's decision to
&gt;&gt; adopt one of the country's most iron-handed Internet
&gt;&gt; policies, The Netly News has learned....

&gt;&gt; The plaintiffs hope to persuade a federal judge that
&gt;&gt; X-Stop's overzealousness violates not just traditions of
&gt;&gt; intellectual freedom in libraries, but the First Amendment
&gt;&gt; as well....
 
&gt; Note that if the library in question were not arm of the State,
&gt; noone would have any First Amendment claim.

Which is why it is a good thing that Libraries are state funded.

&gt; This is reminiscent of TM's recent (controversial) analysis of the fired
&gt; county trashworker/author,
&gt; and suggests a clearer example of the confusion caused by State as Employer:

I don't think I saw TM's analysis, since I am on fight-censorship, but I
don't see where there is any confusion.  Except in very limited
circumstances (National Security), the government cannot hire or fire a
contractor (or employee) based on unrelated speech.

&gt; It is considered legal and moral for a *private employer* can use
&gt; censorware to restrict their LAN's access.

It may be legal, but whether it is moral is certainly debatable.

&gt; But if the employer is the State, and does this, the First might be dragged
&gt; in -confusing the issue,
&gt; since the government acting as State is constrained (by the constitution)
&gt; differently from the government
&gt; acting as Employer (constrained by employment law).

Why is this confusing?  It is very simple to tell the difference between 
the State as employer and the State as censor.

A Public Library is allowed restrict Internet Access to its employees on 
the job, since it is acting as an employer.

A Public Library may not be allowed to restrict Internet Access to its
patrons (we will see how Loudoun turns out).

&gt; Perhaps some critical of Tim's analysis think that when government is
&gt; employer it can't censor its LAN?  Can't remove games from government owned
&gt; PCs?  

&gt; When the government removes games, pictures, etc. from its PCs it is acting
&gt; as a responsible efficient employer.

Not necessarily responsible, but it is legal.

&gt; When the government attempts to remove games, pictures, etc. from stores it
&gt; is acting criminally.

This is correct.

Again, I don't see what is confusing about this.
