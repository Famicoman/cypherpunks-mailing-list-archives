Law in the Electronic Age - It's a Whole New World

The questions of how to prevent and how to detect computer crime are just
the start.  Equally nettlesome are the legal questions  which are just
beginning to be confronted. For example:

-How does one define a computer crime or tort?  How does one prove it in
court?  How does one handle conflicts of laws issues when the locus of the
"crime" is the internet?  What remedies are available or useful - as a
practical matter?  How effective is criminal prosecution in this area? What
happens when the "criminals" are foreign and their activites are lawful in
the host country?

-Who can tax electronic commerce?  How do they do it? What is the
territorial source of income generated in cyberspace?

-How does one prove (or avoid) price collusion under the anti-trust laws
when everyone's prices are instantly available to competitors online?  What
are the antitrust implications of network
economic effects?

-What does the SEC do regarding investor protection when foreign
unregistered securities can be purchased from your desktop PC?  What are
the implications of cyberspace for the future of traditional distribution
channels for IPO's. What is the future of traditional exchanges?

This conference is the beginning of what may prove to be a series of events
which will begin the exploration of these and related questions with
experts active in this arena.
