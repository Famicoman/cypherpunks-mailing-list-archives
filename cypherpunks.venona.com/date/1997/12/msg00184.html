Silver Bullet for Digital Publishing Arrives TragoeS Announces General
Availability of RigthsMarket(TM)

 PR Newswire - December 02, 1997 16:10
 TRGO. %ENT %MLM V%PRN P%PRN

CALGARY, Dec. 2 /CNW-PRN/ - RightsMarket hits the bull's-eye business
opportunity of the 21st century - electronic commerce through digital
publishing on the Internet for the $71.3 billion (US) publishing
industry (Value-Line, April 11/May 20/May 30, 1997).

``RightsMarket harnesses powerful economic forces that will show people
the money in digital document publishing on the Internet,'' stated
Lindsay Moir, President of TragoeS Inc., during the company's news
conference November 18th at COMDEX `97, Las Vegas. ``With RightsMarket
suppliers of digital documents will be paid and 99% of the revenue loss
due to piracy will be eliminated.''

TragoeS has successfully implemented the Superdistribution paradigm in
RightsMarket. Superdistribution tracks usage rather than possession and
is recognised as the best approach to selling digital property (digital
versions of text, data, knowledge, pictures, music, videos, etc.) on the
Internet. Pricing of RightsMarket is $50,000 (US) plus integration,
support fees, and annual license renewal fees.  Unique RightsMarket
features include:

Persistent Cryptographic Wrappers (RightsWrapper) - No matter where the
digital document (financial newsletter, educational test, minutes from a
court proceeding, sensitive health care records, etc.) goes, no matter
how it gets there, whether it is used and then subsequently
redistributed, etc. the document is always encrypted.  It is never left
decrypted and exposed even while it is being viewed.

Rights Marketing `back office' (RightsServer) - Allows marketers to set
the terms and conditions of use for the digital property.  Features
include support for the newly announced international Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) publishing standard.

Fault Tolerant Middleware (RightsConnection) - Provides a secure link to
the `back office' from the user's desktop.  As well, there is no
requirement to be connected full time to the Internet in order to view
the digital document.

Metering and Enforcement (RightsClient) - Provides decryption services,
meters use, and sends usage information to the RightsServer via secure
middleware.

Acrobat(TM) Trusted Tool plug-ins - Makes Acrobat, the world's most
popular digital publishing tool from Adobe Systems Incorporated(C),
ready for prime time digital document economic transactions on the
Internet. With a plug-in for the Exchange and Reader, customers can
encrypt documents and have a trusted player for viewing content.

Shane Hayes, TragoeS' Vice President, Customer Implementation will be
presenting at The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) Technology Forum
Wednesday, December 10, 1997 in New York City.  The DOI is an important
emerging international standard for identification of published material
online. It forms the foundation layer of a set of technologies that will
enable commerce in published material on the Internet so that copyright
is protected, content creators can be compensated for their work, and
consumers can benefit from technology that is sophisticated, yet
seamless and easy to use.  The International DOI Foundation (IDF), a
non-profit organization established to administer the DOI standard, is
looking to technology vendors to implement the necessary technology
components and integrate them into secure electronic publishing
solutions for the IDF's constituency: the worldwide publishing industry
and beyond.

In April 1998 in Washington, DC, TragoeS Inc. will participate in a
three day conference sponsored by the Library of Congress, the
Association of American Publishers (AAP), and the University of
Virginia. The conference is titled ``Exploring the New Media - The
Paradigm Shift in Publishing: &gt;From Book to Bytes''.  TragoeS Vice
President, Marketing and Sales, Fred Yee, will sit on a panel discussing
`Solutions to Copyright Protection in Cyberspace'.

TragoeS Inc., established in 1993, is a Canadian high technology company
specializing in software products and services that support financial
transactions.  Its product, RightsMarket is the solution for the
protection, metering and payment of digital intellectual property.
TragoeS is a public company reporting in Alberta and Ontario and is
listed on the Canadian Dealing Network (CDN TRGO).

The Canadian Dealing Network or other regulatory authorities have
neither approved nor disapproved of the information contained herein.
