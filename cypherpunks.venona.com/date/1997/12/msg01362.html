That would be "renounced" his US citizenship.  

Since he is a UK *resident* as well as a UK *citizen* his move won't save 
much in the way of taxes unless the bulk of his assets are in offshore trusts 
which have been treated more leniently in the UK than in the US.

Paul Getty realises his dream: a British passport 

By James Hardy, Home Affairs Editor

J PAUL Getty II, the billionaire philanthropist, has sealed his love affair 
with Britain by taking out UK citizenship after 25 years' residence in this 
country.

The heir to what was once the world's largest private oil fortune received 
his British passport in the week before Christmas and immediately revoked his 
US nationality, The Telegraph has learned. Mr Getty, 65, who rarely gives 
interviews, is understood to be delighted at the alacrity with which his 
application was processed by the Home Office. The American Government is, by 
contrast, thought to be very disappointed with the development. Typically, Mr 
Getty has chosen not to publicise his change of status.

The adoption of British nationality will automatically attract the close 
attention of the Inland Revenue but friends claimed last night the prospect 
of a major increase in his tax bill did not deter him from seeking 
citizenship. They said his well known affection for the British way of life 
was the overriding factor in his decision. "Paul has given so much to this 
country over the years. It is wonderful that the country has given something 
back to him. I have no idea why he waited until now to apply," said one 
friend.

The son of John Paul Getty , formerly the world's richest man, J Paul Getty 
II has become one of the greatest benefactors the country has ever known. His 
fortune has been estimated at more than £1 billion and he is believed to have 
given away more than £120 million to deserving causes in Britain. He gave £50 
million to the National Gallery, £20 million to the British Film Institute 
and a substantial donation to the building of the Mound Stand at Lord's 
cricket ground.

Thousands of smaller donations, often anonymous, have helped charity appeals 
or raised money for causes ranging from the Special Air Service to religious 
institutions. Friends say that Mr Getty has found a happiness in Britain that 
eluded him for much of his early life. His generosity to British institutions 
was recognised with the award of an honorary knighthood in 1986.

Mr Getty retains a flat adjoining the Ritz Hotel in London but spends most of 
his time at his 2,500 acre country estate at Wormsley, Bucks. He moved to 
Britain permanently the year after the death of his second wife, Tabitha Pol, 
from an accidental drugs overdose in Rome in 1971. In 1994, he married 
Victoria Holdsworth, a long-time British friend. She is widely credited with 
his gradual re-emergence into public life after years when he was rarely 
seen.

Citizenship may give Getty his knight's title By Sandra Barwick

J PAUL Getty II, the American billionaire who has given millions to charities 
in this country, is likely to be able to use the title "Sir" after being made 
a British citizen.

Mr Getty's generosity to British charities was recognised in 1986 when he was 
awarded a KBE, or honorary knighthood, a title he was unable to use because 
he was not a British citizen.

But with the Christmas gift of citizenship, which Home Office sources 
confirmed was granted a week before the holiday, Mr Getty may in future be 
formally accepted as Sir Paul and his wife as Lady Getty.

A 10 Downing Street spokesman said she understood that a recommendation could 
be made to the Queen that the title be formally granted and announced in such 
cases. But Buckingham Palace was unable to comment yesterday.

Other non-British holders of the KBE include Bob Geldof, who is an Irish 
citizen. Mr Getty's accession to citizenship since the honour was awarded is 
unusual, but not unprecedented.

The present Lord Menuhin was made an honorary KBE in 1965 in the same way, 
but became Sir Yehudi Menuhin after he took British nationality in 1985. He 
was later made a life peer.

Heir to what was once the world's largest private oil fortune, Mr Getty, 65, 
has a flat in central London and a 2,500-acre estate at Wormsley, Bucks. He 
is reported to have revoked his US nationality. His affection for Britain is 
well known and friends say he found a happiness here that eluded him for much 
of his earlier life. Son of John Paul Getty, the richest man in the world in 
his day, J Paul Getty II is one of Britain's greatest benefactors.

With an estimated fortune of £1 billion, he has given donations thought to 
total more than £120 million to causes including the National Gallery (£50 
million) and the British Film Institute (£20 million). Mr Getty, a cricket 
enthusiast, also made a substantial donation towards the building of the 
Mount Stand at Lord's, along with thousands of smaller gifts, often 
anonymously, to causes ranging from the SAS to religious institutions.

Three years ago he married Victoria Holdsworth, a British friend widely 
credited with his gradual re-emergence into public life after years when he 
was rarely seen. He moved to Britain permanently in 1972, a year after the 
death of Talitha Pol, his second wife, from an accidental drugs overdose in 
Rome.
