12/25/1997

It started out small: PICS, a simpleton rating language.

And "for a good cause": ideas about everyone needing
digital signatures to use the Net.

Then came Clive and others: let's expand PICS to be world-wide,
and start reporting items politically incorrect to the police.


In comp.org.eff.talk Clive D.W. Feather &lt;clive@on-the-train.demon.co.uk&gt; wrote:

Free speech advocate?

As long as it has been reviewed first.

The FBI has come out in favor of mandatory Key Recovery
on all *domestic* encryption in the USA.

Reason?

: *   In other words, as the debate was framed by Bayse, the right to
: *   privacy is at least partly contingent on a determination by an FBI
: *   agent or clerk that the conversations they already intercepted and
: *   understood do not involve a crime.

PICSRules takes it a step further: review all material,
report everything politically incorrect to the police,
allow each country to censor to its own tune.

An information infrastructure to do so.

It will make us long for the days of false hits by
current filtering programs, where a White House page
was censored because the word "couples" was on it.

Decrees will control what we see.

In Australia:

#   From: bobb@acslink.aone.net.au (Bob Bain), re: PICSRules
#
#   There are some here in Canberra who seem to view the Internet as an
#   extension of the "computer game" laws. There isn't a single computer
#   game that can be marketed in Australia which would be suitable for
#   adults - due to the fact that somebody in Canberra has decreed it.

Can't make an effect decree without a mechanism in place.

More on decrees later.

By labeling all content far beyond the control even

You're not a censor of pornography?

#   From the Lapdance News Service (a division of ASSCnn)....12/1997
#   
#   LONDON, ENGLAND -- Demon Internet, which claims to be Europe's
#   largest Internet service provider (ISP), has begun testing an
#   automated scanning system for Usenet pornography.
#   
#   The system relies on data from the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF),
#   a UK association of ISPs, which has set up telephone and online
#   hotlines  for members of the public to advise on suspect Usenet
#   newsgroups and  Web addresses.
#   
#   "The aim of this new system is to help streamline the process of
#   finding duplicated illegal material on the Internet and reduce the
#   number of abusers of the Internet by reporting and removing the
#   material that has been sent," he said.
#
#   "The software takes an MD5 format fingerprint of each sexually
#   explicit image that has been posted to the Usenet and has been removed
#   for legal reasons," he said, adding that, when the software spots the
#   same fingerprint anywhere else on the Internet, it alerts staff at the
#   ISP, so they can take appropriate action.
#   
#   Plans call for the new software to be used in conjunction with the
#   IWF's program of identifying, reporting, and removing illegal material
#   from newsgroups.
#   
#   The association is an independent organization to implement the
#   proposals jointly agreed by the government, the police...

Oh, my.

Clive Feather is a liar.

He is bending over backwards to give the government and the police
exactly what they want, just as if it had been legislated.

Clive's excuse: this way _newsgroups_ won't be dropped
by government decree.

Oh, big improvement, Clive.

The political whims of the moment will be accommodated.

This is quite different from user-local filtering,
or allocating just one bit for labeling everything
as "child-only" or not.

It's not close to something for merely providing user-level filtering.

Also, there seems to be a disagreement between citizens and
the Government over what even constitutes child pornography.

*   Newark, NJ, Jan 12 (AP)
*
*   A judge ruled today that a father must stand trial for taking nude photos
*   of his six-year-old daughter, despite the man's claim that the pictures
*   were art, not pornography.
*
*   The judge ruled they were not art, despite Mr. Feuer's instructor, Susan
*   Klechner of the International Center of Photography in New York City,
*   submitting an affidavit saying the pictures were taken for the course
*   and were consistent with the assignment.
*
*   After his arrest, Mr. Feuer was ordered not to have contact with his
*   daughter and could not stay at his home while the prosecution's
*   investigation continued.
*
*   The order was lifted last April, but David Ruhnke, Mr. Feuer's lawyer,
*   said "It's really difficult to overstate what a nightmare this has
*   been for him."
*
*   Mr. Ruhnke further complained that the judge revealed Mr. Feuer's name
*   in court papers while he was still making motions to dismiss the case,
*   to protect the girl.

Even respected photographers are hassled.


-------------------- Begin Cryptography Manifesto excerpt --------------------

We netizens are rightfully paranoid of the
American government, because it has no scruples.

What the FBI did to photographer Jock Sturges was criminal.


Excerpt from 'TO: A Journal of Poetry, Prose + the Visual Arts', Summer 1992:

* Hounded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a bizarre witch-hunt
* at an expense to the taxpayers of over a million dollars, Sturges had
* survived an attempt to destroy his life and his work and was now
* countersuing the agency.
* 
* Recapitulated briefly, Sturges, who's based in San Francisco, has for
* years been photographing young people whose families practice nudity.
* 
* He's done so with his subjects' permission, as well as that of their
* parents, who often appear in the photographs along with their offspring.
* Rejecting the use of standard model releases, with their blanket
* permissions, the photographer chooses instead to request approval
* from his subjects for each and every exhibition and publication
* of each and every image --- an exemplary scrupulousness.
* 
* Then, in 1990, alerted to the "questionable" content of some of his
* images by a local processing lab, the FBI arrested Joe Semien, Sturge's
* assistant, invaded the photographer's San Francisco studio without a
* warrant, and seized all his prints, negatives, records, and equipment;
* thereafter, without arresting Sturges, or even charging him with
* anything, they refused to return his property and did everything
* possible to destroy him personally and professionally by branding
* him a child pornographer

On September 15, 1991, The New York Times  reported that the Feds took the
case to a grand jury after 17 months, and they immediately threw it out.

And that "this was unusual because only the prosecution's evidence is
presented to a grand jury and they generally return indictments at
the Government's request".

Excerpt from 'TO: A Journal of Poetry, Prose + the Visual Arts', Summer 1992:

* Jock Sturges:
* 
* It took another month to get the U.S. Attorney to admit they had
* finished the investigation and that the case was closed.
* 
* Before they were through they had interviewed forty-four families in
* France to whom they lied outrageously.
* 
* It seems the Feds were unable to get the French interested because
* the French Police thought the photographs were just lovely. So the
* French were given the impression by the U.S. government that I had
* been convicted of incest in the United States and that I was a
* dangerous individual.
* 
* And based on this assumption, the French Police conducted their own
* interviews, but my friends happily knew me well enough. When they
* found out they had been misled, the French Police called everybody
* back and apologized.
* 
* Nevertheless, an enormous amount of effort was put out in France to
* go and talk to all these people and a similar thing was done in
* Germany. This was not all free. It was hideously expensive. And the
* repercussions --- I don't know what they are yet. I haven't talked
* to all the families.
* 
* In the end, everything I received back was essentially destroyed.
* 
* My computer was broken.
* 
* All my prints were badly damaged.
* 
* Some of them had been wadded up and thrown away and then taken out
* of the waste basket and flattened out again.

It cost Sturges $100,000 in legal fees, loss of major clients, much income,
seizure of his life's work, the tools of his trade, and made him feel
depressed about his life's work.


Our government uses Orwellian terror tactics
to control the politically incorrect:

    Jock Sturges:

    At my lowest point in this affair, I almost decided to jump
    from the San Francisco bridge. I had stopped my car.

Where have I heard that "Human Dignity" stuff before?

Oh yeah: Congress passed a law (overturned by the US Supreme Court) called
something like "Decency and Honor in the Military", which outlawed selling
Playboy and Penthouse magazines from military base stores.

Yep.

Chris says he merely wants it for "statistics".

Chris Lewis has declared I am on his content-based NoCeM list.
I apparently profess views he doesn't appreciate, so I am labeled
as "bad" so I can be "filtered".

People couldn't possible choose to killfile me on their own.

It's just a "global killfile" said someone.

Same goes for the whole PICSRules deal...completely unnecessary.

PICSRules wants to "objectively" label content.

A Senator Feinstein here in the USA keeps introducing a
bill to outlaw "bombmaking information on the Internet".

*   C-SPAN Television, Wednesday June 5th, 1997
*
*   Andrew Grove, Chairman &amp; CEO of Intel Corporation, is asked whether
*   bomb-making information should be censored from the Internet.
*
*   "No. The same information is available in libraries, and we don't
*   censor libraries, nor should we. When I was thirteen I built a
*   nitroglycerin bomb. It was an incredibly stupid thing to do,
*   and I knew someone who had their hand blown off, but I am
*   adamantly against censoring such material."
*
*   "And unlike a library, a parent can buy a program that uses keyword
*   monitoring to disallow Internet traffic per the parents' wishes.
*   Such a program is available now, and costs only $29."

Mr. Grove was just awarded Time magazine's "Man of the Year".

So, one day there's material labeled "adult/bomb info", and the
next day: it's illegal in the USA.

Only way to do it: require PICSRules filtering at the ISP level.

Nothing else scales.

:  "The aim of this new system is to help streamline the process of

You aren't fooling anyone, Clive.

And what was that about getting rid of anonymity, by - at the least -
guaranteeing traceability even through anonymous remailers?

Brad Templeton, EFF director, has a few ideas of his own:

   "no fake addresses is one of my non-negotiable
    requirements...eventual Usenet will require
    digital signatures"  --- Brad Templeton


Funny, how MLM companies (yes, ISP accounts are an MLM-able product)
including Brad's Clarinet company would like to get rid of short-term
ISP accounts too.

Brad states he wants commitment and accountability.

This EFF director wants all email and Usenet posts signed
by your digital signature, a massive control-freak change
in the status quo.

This twists some of the very technology netizens hoped
would protect us to being used against us.

*** Brad is emphatically for digital signature authentication, #1:
 
#   I am not talking about law.  I am talking about practice.
#   You want to mail me, you put a digital sig on your mail.
#   You want to send a posting into my news server,
#   you put a digital sig on it.
 
 
*** Brad is emphatically for digital signature authentication, #2:
 
Brad Templeton emailed:
*   Information Security emailed:
 
*   &gt; Nor does your digital signature idea do anything to prevent
*   &gt; throw-away accounts from doing major spams; you'll have to
*   &gt; put even MORE controls on people.
*
*   Correct, no throw away accounts.  It's coming.
*
*   &gt; The digital signature idea is an astonishingly bad idea, that
*   &gt; only frustrated control-freaks will accept.
*
*   You are mistaken.  I surveyed a roomful of usenet admins at a

&gt;   As far as I am concerned, no fake addresses is one of my non-negotiable

&gt;
&gt;      the eventual USENET is going to have digital signature requirements.
&gt;
&gt;   It's the only way to stop [people from] posting under fake addresses
&gt;   where we can't find them, and that means stopping honest users from
&gt;   doing it too.

    Solutions...
 
    First, improve internet mail systems and protocols to
    identify mail with a fake or forged return address.
 
    There are some simple steps to do this, and
    eventually digital signature allows complete
    verification of the sender.

    <A  HREF="http://polka.clari.net/usenet-format/cert.html">http://polka.clari.net/usenet-format/cert.html</A>
 
    Q: What about anonymous remailers?
 
    A: A person with an anonymous address that sends mail back will
    probably be able to get a certificate. They can post without revealing
    their name, except perhaps to the person who gives them a certificate.
    Digital signature works fine to prove the same person sent two messages
    without saying at all who that person is in the real world.
 
Forced to authenticate they are the same
person, even through the anonymous remailer.
 
A certificate by another person needed.
 
I call that traceable.

No comment by the EFF.

PICSRules is just the first step in putting the entire Net under
government control.

See how important it is to Brad that ~"people can be found"?

Everyone with power becomes a control freak, apparently.

That's right: the laws can be re-interpreted at any time by the police.

In the above mentioned case, Janet Reno's Department of Justice had
first filed a brief with the US Supreme Court AGAINST a child
pornography conviction for the person involved.

During election year politics, over 200 Senators wrote to her and
said they'd make a big campaign issue of it if she didn't change
her mind.

She changed her mind and filed an OPPOSITE brief in the Supreme Court.

Sheesh.

*   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), committee chair and chief sponsor of the

Anyone wishing a copy of the 'Cryptography Manifesto', email guy
@panix.com using subject line 'Requesting Cryptography Manifesto'.

It's 519K (about 75 double-sided pages).
