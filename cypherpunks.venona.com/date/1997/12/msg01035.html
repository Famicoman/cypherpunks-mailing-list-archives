[Hmm. Apparently Charles is reluctant to defend his position here on
cypherpunks. Small surprise. --Declan]

        Declan McCullagh, still displaying a reluctance to debate with
graciousness (below), now wonders if I've heard of the Federalist Society.
"PS: I wonder if Mueller knows about the Federalist Society, which is a
group of libertarian-leaning lawyers and law professors. Among other things,
they make a point of educating judges about (gasp!) economic theory and this
concept of a government strictly limited in its powers..."

        I've been reporting on this propaganda mill for roughly 2 decades--
and have published hundreds of pages on it.  (See my January post on the
subject, below.)

&gt;&gt;Subject: GMU's "Law &amp; Economics Center"
&gt;&gt;X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        Perhaps I can add some information on the "Law &amp; Economics Center"
&gt;&gt;at George Mason.  My journal first reported on its teach-in with the federal
&gt;&gt;judges in 1981 (Vol. 13, No. 3, pp. 70-71) and the following year I
&gt;&gt;physically visited the University of Miami campus (where it was then housed)
&gt;&gt;and did extensive interviews with several of the Center's people.  Those
&gt;&gt;interviews, plus another interview series I did at Emory University in
&gt;&gt;Atlanta when the Center moved there, and finally at George Mason itself
&gt;&gt;after the 3rd move, fill a number of my issues, beginning with Vol. 14, No.
&gt;&gt;2 (1982).  I've also reported on a couple of the legal challenges
&gt;&gt;(unsuccessful) to the Center's indoctrination of the federal judges.
&gt;&gt;        For example, U.S. District Judge Spencer Williams presided over a
&gt;&gt;predatory pricing case against ITT Continental Baking (Wonder Bread) some
&gt;&gt;years back.  The day after the jury began its deliberations, Judge Williams
&gt;&gt;left San Francisco to begin attendance at a 2-week "economics" seminar
&gt;&gt;presented by the Law &amp; Economics Center at the Royal Biscayne Hotel in
&gt;&gt;Miami.  While he was gone, his jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in
&gt;&gt;the amount of $5 million which, under the law, he was bound to triple to $15
&gt;&gt;million.  Instead, he returned from Florida, overturned the jury's verdict,
&gt;&gt;and wrote a letter to Henry Manne in Miami that read in part as follows:
&gt;&gt;"As a result of my better understanding of the concept of marginal cost, I
&gt;&gt;have recently set aside a $15 million antitrust verdict.  I will send you a
&gt;&gt;copy of the memorandum [opinion] as soon as it is prepared."  (See my
&gt;&gt;journal, Vol. 17, No. 2 (1985), p. 13.)
&gt;&gt;        Nan Aron and her colleagues at the Alliance for Justice in
&gt;&gt;Washington published a monograph on the subject--Justice for Sale In
&gt;&gt;America--in 1993 and I reprinted the key chapters in my journal, beginning
&gt;&gt;with Vol. 24, No. 3 (1993).  For earlier background, see Fortune, May 21,
&gt;&gt;1979; Washington Post, January 20, 1980; and The Nation, January 26, 1980.
&gt;&gt;        Put simply, this "Center" is a right-wing propaganda mill
&gt;&gt;masquerading as a purveyor of academic "economics."  The "teachers" have
&gt;&gt;been Harold Demsetz and others from the University of Chicago and its major
&gt;&gt;academic outposts (paid at an hourly rate commensurate with the up to $600
&gt;&gt;per hour commanded by George Stigler and the others as antitrust "experts"
&gt;&gt;in court).  No opposing economists have ever been allowed to appear before
&gt;&gt;the judges.  When I asked the Center's people why they didn't permit
&gt;&gt;distinguished non-Chicago economists to share the podium at these judicial
&gt;&gt;teach-ins, they laughed and said, "Let them go start their OWN seminars for
&gt;&gt;the judges!"
&gt;&gt;        I asked to be allowed to just sit in as an OBSERVER with the judges
&gt;&gt;and/or the 200 antitrust law professors (who have been run through a similar
&gt;&gt;indoctrination program) and Henry Manne himself responded to my request (by
&gt;&gt;telephone), No, "We keep it all in the family."  (Manne, who had been a law
&gt;&gt;professor at the University of Rochester, founded the "Center" in 1974 at
&gt;&gt;the University of Miami, then moved it to Emory and finally to George Mason.
&gt;&gt;A federal judge--Judge Hoffman, as I recall--helped him get the approval of
&gt;&gt;the judiciary's executive body in Washington, headed by the Chief Justice of
&gt;&gt;the Supreme Court.  The money to finance these sessions at luxury resorts
&gt;&gt;(mostly at Key Biscayne and other Florida beach towns) was originally gotten
&gt;&gt;directly from  Fortune 500 companies who had experienced the sting of
&gt;&gt;antitrust prosecution; in response to some criticism of that obvious
&gt;&gt;conflict of interest, Manne, with some creative accounting, arranged it so
&gt;&gt;that the seminars for the judges themselves--in 1981, the cost was $5,000
&gt;&gt;per judge per 2-week seminar--were thereafter paid for exclusively by the
&gt;&gt;corporate foundations, e.g., Schaife, Olin, etc., rather than by active
&gt;&gt;firms that frequently appear before the judges as antitrust defendants.
&gt;&gt;With this accounting twist, the judiciary gave its full blessing to the
&gt;&gt;operation.)
&gt;&gt;        I also did an interview with a federal appeals judge in Washington
&gt;&gt;(DC Circuit).  He saw nothing wrong with Manne's program, even assuming it
&gt;&gt;was pure propaganda designed specifically to bias the federal judiciary
&gt;&gt;against the antitrust laws and in favor of corporate monopoly.  Why?  (1)
&gt;&gt;First, he said, judges are, by the nature of their work, "immune" to
&gt;&gt;propaganda of all kinds.  They hear so much argument on so many sides of
&gt;&gt;every issue that it's simply impossible to "bias" them via argument.  (2)
&gt;&gt;Second, he told me, federal judges have every RIGHT to be as intellectually
&gt;&gt;"biased" as they like and to DEVELOP those intellectual biases with the help
&gt;&gt;of WHOEVER they please.
&gt;&gt;        For example, he said, suppose I go to the beach for a weekend with 3
&gt;&gt;volumes of Karl Marx's writings in my briefcase.  I find Marx so persuasive
&gt;&gt;that I come back to my chambers on Monday, throw away an opinion I had just
&gt;&gt;written on one of the cases before me, and proceed to write a new one
&gt;giving my
&gt;&gt;decision to the opposite party.  Karl Marx "biased" me to change my
&gt;&gt;decision.  He had every right to do it--and I had every right to LET him
&gt;&gt;do it.
&gt;&gt;        George Mason University law school and its economics department
&gt;&gt;aren't scholarly enterprises at all; they're hired propagandists, awash in
&gt;&gt;corporate money awarded precisely for the purpose of making a contrived
&gt;&gt;"economic" case for laissez-faire monopoly.  They get away with it for one
&gt;&gt;reason and one reason only:  Manne's operation had the approval of Reagan's
&gt;&gt;Justice Department (rember Ed Meese?) and now it has the blessing of
&gt;&gt;Clinton's.  All it would take to bring it to a halt would be a couple of
&gt;&gt;speeches by, say, the Attorney General and, if necessary, by Clinton
&gt;&gt;himself.  If Justice treated it as the outrage that it plainly is, the
&gt;&gt;press--and the ensuing public condemnation--would purge the judiciary of
&gt;&gt;this 20-year scandal within a matter of weeks.
