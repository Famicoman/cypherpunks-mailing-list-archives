<PRE>
There's an interesting paper at <A  HREF="http://www.cesg.gov.uk/ellisint.htm">http://www.cesg.gov.uk/ellisint.htm</A> which 
claims that UK spooks invented both RSA and DH in 1973 and 1974 respectively.
The summary info is:

&gt;This paper by James Ellis was written in 1987. It was commissioned shortly 
&gt;after his retirement to provide a first-hand historical account of the early 
&gt;work by James and others in CESG, discovering the techniques that were later 
&gt;to become known as Public Key Cryptography. Although there would have been
&gt;some academic interest in the paper back in 1987, it was decided on balance 
&gt;to keep the record internal and accordingly the paper was given a low
&gt;classification and retained within CESG. 
&gt;
&gt;Since 1987 there have been three aspects which have created enormous changes 
&gt;for CESG. First, the growth in the need for secure communications for 
&gt;confidentiality and authentication has vastly increased key management 
&gt;requirements. Second, the increase in processing speed has enabled large 
&gt;arithmetical computations to be practicable. Third, the 1994 RPS gave CESG 
&gt;responsibility for the communications security of the entire UK government 
&gt;market. PKC is now seen as the best if not the only method for allowing wide 
&gt;area many-user secure communications. With this increase in CESG's external 
&gt;visibility there has been a growing desire for greater openness.
&gt;
&gt;During the past 11 years there had been no urgency to publish the paper, but 
&gt;the necessary spark came when Clifford Cocks solved an important problem that 
&gt;had been highlighted at a recent 'RSA' conference. Cliff is presenting this 
&gt;solution in a paper at the IMA Conference on Cryptography and Coding in
&gt;Cirencester. Since he was one of the main contributors to our early work it 
&gt;was clearly the right opportunity to set the record straight. As the paper 
&gt;was being prepared for publication we heard that James had become very ill. 
&gt;He died before the paper was published. We now publish it as a testament to 
&gt;his imaginative and ground-breaking work.

(The paper was mentioned on a UK crypto list, but I've lost the original 
 reference).

Peter.
