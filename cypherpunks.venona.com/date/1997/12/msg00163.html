I'd add to Marc's post one comment and one question:

* We heard a lot of hot air at the summit this week about "diversity." But
I'm not as interested in experiencing a "diversity" of PICS-based systems
as I am a diversity of ideas. 

* Danny, your boss told me today that "you can't stop legislators from
legislating." (Personally, I think you can: the 9-0 CDA ruling gives them
cover.) But if you believe legislation is inevitable, do rating systems
help or hinder civil liberties? Do they provide a framework that Congress
will formalize make mandatory? And do they let the DoJ argue that it's
easier to comply with a CDA II through "mandatory voluntary" self-rating? 

BTW, good news from Time-Warner. We are NOT going to self-rate or
self-label. This is a corporate-wide policy and applies to pathfinder.com,
all the Warner Bros movie and cartoon sites, and other sites like cnn.com.

&gt; I think where the free expression groups differ fundamentally
&gt; from the position CDT has set out is that we do not believe
&gt; that the Net should be dominated by rating systems.
&gt; 
&gt; We recognize that parents have some legitimate concerns about
&gt; the availability of objectionable material. But we think that
&gt; there are alternatives to widespread ratings -- including
&gt; learning more about the benefits of the Internet -- that
&gt; are preferable.
&gt; 
&gt; We also recognize that there is a risk that Congress will try to
&gt; pass CDA II. But we believe that it will be difficult for such
&gt; an act to survive Constitutional review after Reno v. ACLU.
&gt; We are perhaps more concerned that an architecture of ubiquitous
&gt; ratings will provide, as Barry Steinhardt said well at the summit,
&gt; a blueprint for legislation that would be upheld.
&gt; 
&gt; What exactly does CDT plan to say to the enthusiastic member
&gt; of Congress who backs your rating plan and wants to see it
&gt; enforced with sanctions?
&gt; 
&gt; What are your own views about a filtering search engine
&gt; that block access to 99% of the references concerning the
&gt; "American Red Cross"?
&gt; 
&gt; A diversity of rating systems is the not the same as a
&gt; diversity of viewpoints. It is rather a diversity of
&gt; fears and prejudices. I hope we never see the day
&gt; when national organizations are routinely called upon to
&gt; draw up lists of what they do not want others to see.
&gt; I suspect that those who are concerned about the
&gt; future of free expression share this view.
