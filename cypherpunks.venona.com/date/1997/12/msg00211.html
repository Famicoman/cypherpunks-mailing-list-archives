<PRE>

There are two pieces of code included in this message.  Or, at least,
there would be if I were allowed to express my ideas.  Accordingly,
the first piece of code has been carefully censored.

The second piece of code is a Perl script which does the censoring.
The model is that of a tape which the censor lays across anything
"offensive."

The Perl script has -C and -Perl modes which try to preserve comments.
(They can be fooled, so you should look over the results before
distributing.)  You can also specify the string which is "printed" on
the tape.

The idea is that every time I write a piece of code which I cannot
distribute freely, a censored version will be mailed to appropriate
newsgroups, mailing lists, newspapers, and politicians.

This should have the effect of continually raising and dramatizing the
issue, as well as demonstrating repeatedly how ridiculous it is.

I would hope that some decades into the future we will be able to look
through the archives for these scraps of censored code and find it
amusing.
