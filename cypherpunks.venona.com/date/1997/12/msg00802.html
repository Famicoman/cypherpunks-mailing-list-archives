Bianca sat silently, trying to compose herself before facing the children
and bringing them up to date on the quickly changing situation surrounding
an educational process which had been, up to now, mostly an exciting
exercise in technological mystery and intrigue.
Despite her inability to cover up the full depth of her current despair, the
point became moot when she entered the room to find the girls all
suppressing giggles, and the lone boy in the group sitting with his arms
folded across his chest and grinning madly.

Bianca turned her back for a moment, to suppress a genuine smile, and then
turned once again to face the children, feigning an unsuspecting manner.

"Can anyone tell me who Attila the Hun was?" Bianca asked, knowing that
Human Gus-Peter might well wet his pants resisting his urge to raise his
hand in order to get the opportunity to brag once again about one of his
historic heroes.
All of the girls raised their hands, giggling all the more over the Nephew's
predicament.

"Yes?" Bianca nodded toward Totokyo Rose.

"Attila the Hun was the greatest MeatSpace Warrior who ever lived." Rose
shouted, leaping to her feet and mimicking the ferocious grimace that the
Nephew usually affected when speaking reverently about his favorite
historical hero.
Human Gus-Peter nodded thankfully to young Rose, who blushed at the
realization that she had instinctively acted as a compatriot and
co-conspirator to the secret admirer who loved to tease her so mercilessly
(and vice-versa).

Bianca thanked Rose as she sat down, and then began pacing back and forth
slowly in front of the children. She gave a discrete wink to Rose as she
strolled, alerting her that the next question would give her an opportunity
to redeem herself as the Nephew's chief adversary among the young ladies who
vied to torture him relentlessly for the sins of his forefathers, who had
held their mothers in such low esteem in the fields of math and science.

"And who is Attila T. Hun?" Bianca asked, referring to the boy's chief hero
and mentor in the arena of CypherSpace Killosophy.
The Nephew was bouncing up and down in his excitement, but he managed to
keep his arms tightly folded across his chest, guarding the secret that he
shared with the still giggling young girls. He smiled at Totokyo Rose as she
raised her hand once again.

"Yes, Rose." Bianca smiled.

"Attila T. Hun is a CypherPunk who was exposed as a wannabe when
Hallam-Baker revealed to the list that he was a sixteen year-old kid with an
overactive imagination." Rose beamed.

"Not! Not!!!" Human Gus-Peter leapt to his feet to defend his idol, dropping
his arms and revealing the message that the youngsters had been busy
stenciling on his T-shirt while Bianca had been engaged in deciphering her
latest email messages.
Bianca laughed as hard as the girls as the Nephew's impulsive reaction to
Rose's teasing led to the revelation of the message newly emblazoned on his
chest.

  "I GAK'ed my uncle's Secret Keys, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt."

Bianca chuckled inwardly, as she outwardly frowned and shook her head sadly.
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to turn you over to the Tickle Gestapo." she
said, breaking into a laugh as the Nephew's eyes grew wide in alarm and he
bolted for the door with a gaggle of giggling girls close on his heels.
She sighed with relief as the Battle Royal began in the snow outside,
knowing that she would now have a bit of time to prepare for what she had to
say to the children. As yet, however, she was not sure just what to say.

Bianca went over the morning's events in her mind.
Of all the mornings to sleep in… Damn!

The children had already been deeply engrossed in various computer exercises
by the time she had shaken off the deep slumber of the previous night. It
was sleep she desperately needed, but it had come at exactly the wrong time.
She had woken up to find an urgent email message that had apparently arrived
just as she was drifting off into never-never-land.

From: GOD &lt;god@everything.all&gt;
BCC: Dave Null &lt;dnull@dev.null&gt;
Subject: "Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of the Void?"

Dear Melissa's Great-Great-Grandmother,
"David Jansen's dead, it's up to me to carry on."
~ The Last Canadian Outlaw

"he's gone, man. he's gone…"
~ Jerry T. Garcia

"If you don't leave me alone, I'll find someone who will."
~ T. Gosney Thorton

"For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the
promise made of no effect."
~ Ultramontane 4:14

Sincerely,
God
"Who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as
though they did."
~ Ultramontane 4:17

Bianca hadn't bothered to check the PGP signature on the message, knowing
that the Author was the only person besides George Burns who could get away
with forging messages from God without getting struck by lightning.

The goDog had obviously gone to ground, with John Law's hounds nipping
closely at his heels. Apparently, he believed that the Blind Faith Server at
dev.null had been compromised, as well. When Bianca had logged on to pull
the plug on it, however, all signs that it had ever existed had already been
purged from one end of the InterNet to the other.
Bianca got a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, once again, as she
realized that this was possible to do only through the Blind Faith Server
itself, which meant that whoever had taken down dev.null had accessed the
heart of the Circle of Eunuchs communications system, potentially putting
everyone, including the children, in jeopardy.
She rose angrily to her feet, angry at herself for having let the Author
allay her initial fears about exposing the children to danger by allowing
them to use the dev.null shadow email system.

"In for a penny, in for a pound." he had said, nonchalantly. "Unless you are
willing to put their bodies and minds in the hand of The Destroyer right
now, you'd best give them the tools and knowledge to prevent it from
happening later.
"Besides, we are more likely to need those little scamps to pull our ass out
of the fire than the other way around." he had continued, with a wink.

Bianca was shaken out of her reverie by the entrance of the children, who
were laughing and shaking the snow out of their hair and clothes. Except for
the Nephew, who was holding his sides and grimacing in pain.
"They have tic-killed me to death!" he said, dramatically, falling limp to
the floor.

Bianca motioned for the girls to gather around her on the floor, and they
sat quietly until Human Gus-Peter peeked up to see that nobody was paying
attention to him, whereupon he quietly joined them. Bianca began…

"I have something very serious to discuss with you." she began.
Although we have had a lot of fun up to now, playing hide-and-seek with
others and ourselves in CyberSpace, I have constantly reminded you that we
must perform all of our actions as if the consequences could be deadly
serious, for there would come a day in the future when this would become
true for the past."
"That day has finally arrived." Bianca said solemnly, worried that the
children didn't seem to understand the gravity of what she was trying to
tell them. She decided that a direct approach would be the best.

"A number of members of the Magic Circle, including your uncle," she nodded
to Human Gus-Peter, "have gone to ground like wounded foxes, holing up while
waiting their chance to make a break for higher ground."
"As well, I have received communications indicating that the Shadow has
sniffed out the Blind Faith Server, and…" she paused to change her voice to
reflect the seriousness of the situation, "it appears that dev.null has been
compromised."

At this grave pronouncement, the children began giggling, and Totokyo Rose
gave MustHang Sally a thinly veiled poke in the ribs. Bianca gave herself an
inward slap on the forehead, stepped forward to hover menacingly over Sally,
and asked sternly, "Is there something you would like to tell me, Sally?"

"Nein, Herr Commandant! Nein, Nein!" was Sally's reply.
The children broke into such a fit of sniggering and chortling at this
point, that Bianca abandoned them to the Invisible Tickle Monster and headed
to her computer to look for inevitable pointer to the ClueServer that the
young archfiends would have left behind for her.
Though the children had developed an amazingly intricate labyrinth of secret
signs and messages by which they used to communicate a remarkable array of
information ranging from technical information to mystical parables, they
always gave their elders clues about as subtle as a fireball in the sky,
apparently being under the impression that shortly beyond puberty lay
senility.

Bianca typed '999' into her computer and hit the return key, whereupon it
turned out that the phrase had been aliased to a slow-running batch file
which echoed its internal commands onto the screen as if lip-reading them
with great difficulty:

                         "The Citizen as a Decimal"
                       A Theorem by Martha MathMonster

Government = Power Corporate = Money Money = Power

Government + Corporate = Fascism Statism = Standardization

(Government + Statism) = (Corporate + Standardization)

Unitary Theory of Fascist Statism: If Government and Corporate interests
become a Unity then Decimals become insignificant dots. Therefore, under
Fascism, the citizen is no longer a citizen-unit, but a Decimal.

The Revelation of SaintMonger LanniTastic the Divine (In Bed)

13:16 "He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave,
to receive a digitally implanted Persistent Identity $$N in their right hand
or on their foreheads."
13:17 "and that no one may buy or sell except one who has a PI-$$N or
traceable Bea$tCa$h, or a Digital Certificate authorized by the Bea$t."
13:18 "Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the Bea$t (keeping in mind that Micro$haft Money has a Millennium Bug in it
that gives a result that is different from one returned by the more
spiritually-correct Quickening $oftware), for it is the number of a ManBoy:
His number is GGG."

   CypherKid Reminder To Senile Old Farts Wearing Their Ties Too Tight And
                 Cutting Off The Blood Blow To Their Brain:

The worse the Y2K problem is, the easier you can steal.
The worse the Y2K problem is, the harder it will be for the government to
steal.
The worse the Y2K problem is, the more intelligence and initiative will
evolve.
The worse the Y2K problem, the faster the dinosaurs die.
Ad infinituum…
