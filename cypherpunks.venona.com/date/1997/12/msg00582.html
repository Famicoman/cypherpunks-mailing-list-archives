&gt; ===============================================
&gt; NEWS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY
&gt; 2600 Virginia Avenue, NW, Suite 100
&gt; Washington DC 20037
&gt; ===============================================
&gt; For release: December 9, 1997

&gt; ===============================================
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The evidence is clear: Only criminals don't
&gt; support concealed-carry laws, say Libertarians
&gt;
&gt;         WASHINGTON, DC -- If you want to reduce crime, allow more
&gt; people to carry more concealed guns, the Libertarian Party said today.
&gt;
&gt;         And that opinion is confirmed by a new Cato Institute study,
&gt; which found that violent crime rates dropped dramatically in the 24
&gt; states that have passed "concealed-carry" laws -- which allow ordinary
&gt; citizens to carry concealed weapons.
&gt;
&gt;         "At this point, the only people who don't support
&gt; concealed-carry laws are criminals," said Steve Dasbach, the party's
&gt; national chairman.
&gt;
&gt;         In those 24 states, concealed-carry laws force local police to
&gt; grant most citizens a concealed weapon permit after meeting certain
&gt; qualifications. Usually, that includes getting fingerprinted, passing a
&gt; criminal background check, and taking a gun safety course.
&gt;
&gt;         "For years, gun-control advocates claimed that laws allowing
&gt; concealed weapons would lead to murder and mayhem," said Steve Dasbach,
&gt; chairman of the Libertarian Party. "But the exact opposite is true:
&gt; Concealed weapons actually save lives."
&gt;
&gt;         The Cato Institute study, timed to coincide with the 10-year
&gt; anniversary of Florida's controversial concealed-carry law, found that
&gt; in the 24 states with concealed-carry laws, murders dropped by 7.7%,
&gt; rapes fell by 5.2%, robberies decreased by 2.2%, and aggravated
&gt; assaults were reduced by 7%.
&gt;
&gt;         And in states where politicians continue to outlaw concealed
&gt; weapons?
&gt;
&gt;         "There's blood in the streets," Dasbach said. "After accounting
&gt; for all other factors, the study calculated that in 1992 alone, 1,414
&gt; more people were murdered than would have been if concealed-carry laws
&gt; were in effect."
&gt;
&gt;         And the carnage doesn't end there: An additional 4,177 people
&gt; were raped, 11,898 more were robbed, and 60,363 more assaulted solely
&gt; as a result of the increased criminal activity that apparently comes
&gt; with concealed weapons bans, the study said.
&gt;
&gt;         "But who is surprised that violent street thugs prefer to prey
&gt; on people who can't shoot back?" Dasbach asked. "By refusing to approve
&gt; concealed-carry laws, politicians in other states have painted a target
&gt; on the back of America's most vulnerable citizens."
&gt;
&gt;         The study also shoots a hole in two other gun-control myths,
&gt; Dasbach said. One is that concealed-carry laws will resurrect the "Wild
&gt; West," turning ordinary Americans into trigger-happy gunslingers.
&gt;
&gt;         "The study found that the number of concealed-carry
&gt; permit-holders convicted of murder committed in public is exactly zero,
&gt; and less serious crimes are extremely rare," he said. For example, only
&gt; one in 5,000 Floridians have had their permits revoked for crimes
&gt; involving a firearm.
&gt;
&gt;         The other myth: That accidental shootings will become
&gt; commonplace.
&gt;
&gt;         "The number of accidental deaths increased so slightly (less
&gt; than half of 1%) that implementing concealed-carry laws in every
&gt; remaining state would result in less than one additional death per year
&gt; - -- far less than the number of lives saved because of the reduced
&gt; murder rate," said Dasbach.
&gt;
&gt;         "In other words, the real danger comes not from concealed
&gt; weapons, but from the lack of them," he said.
&gt;
&gt;         Dasbach emphasized that although concealed-carry laws are a
&gt; major step in the right direction, they're not the perfect solution for
&gt; Libertarians.
&gt;
&gt;         "Right-to-carry laws are only a partial victory because
&gt; Americans shouldn't have to seek government permission to exercise any
&gt; Constitutional right. Imagine what would happen if politicians dared to
&gt; require every journalist to pass a writing test to get a permit to
&gt; cover city hall, or tried to force ministers to demonstrate a basic
&gt; knowledge of religion before giving a sermon," he said.
&gt;
&gt;         But requiring a permit is better than the alternative, he said:
&gt; Sentencing innocent people to death because they can't legally defend
&gt; themselves.
&gt;
&gt;         "Denying terrified Americans the right to carry a gun is like
&gt; putting them at the front of the line on Death Row," he said. "At they
&gt; very least, politicians should have the decency to stop disarming
&gt; America's most vulnerable citizens: Crime victims."
