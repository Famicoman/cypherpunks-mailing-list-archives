Too Far

  Rep. Paul's comments about Waco irresponsible
  
   
   
   U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, said on C-SPAN that he lived in fear
   of being "bombed by the federal government in another Waco." Paul has
   embarrassed himself, his constituents and the state of Texas.
   
   The congressman needs to put aside his hysteria long enough to
   remember the facts of the standoff between federal agents and the
   Branch Davidians:
   
   Members of the cult gunned down federal agents who had come to serve a
   search warrant at the Davidian compound, which they accurately
   believed to contain automatic weapons and other illegal armaments.
   Before that, the group's leader had sexually assaulted several
   children of his followers.
   
   The FBI allowed the group weeks to lay down its arms and surrender.
   Some members and their children did surrender and received every
   consideration from authorities; others set fire to their own building,
   causing the deaths of 81 people, including 25 children.
   
   Paul is wrong to state that the government bombed the Davidians and to
   imply further that Americans should fear that their lives might be
   ended any moment by murderous, renegade federal law enforcement
   officers. His irresponsible remarks encourage the irrational fears
   that were the root cause of the Davidian tragedy and make similar
   confrontations more likely.
   
   Rep. Chet Edwards of Waco perhaps had the best advice for Paul. If the
   congressman really fears he will be bombed by federal agents, he
   should leave Washington.
