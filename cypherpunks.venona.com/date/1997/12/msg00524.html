&gt;                           HACKERS BREAK INTO YAHOO!,
&gt;                           CALL FOR RELEASE OF MITNICK
&gt;                                        
&gt;      Yahoo December 9, 1997
&gt;      Web posted at: 5:54 p.m. EST (2254 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      NEW YORK (AP) -- Hackers broke into Yahoo!, the Internet's most
&gt;      popular site, demanding the release of an imprisoned comrade and
&gt;      threatening to unleash a crippling computer virus if he is not
&gt;      freed.
&gt;      
&gt;      Computer security experts were skeptical of the hackers' claim that
&gt;      they had implanted such a virus.
&gt;      
&gt;      The hackers, calling themselves PANTS/HAGIS, got into Yahoo!'s World
&gt;      Wide Web site at about 10 p.m. Monday, leaving a digital ransom
&gt;      note.
&gt;      
&gt;      "For the past month, anyone who has viewed Yahoo's page &amp; used their
&gt;      search engine, now has a logic bomb/worm implanted deep within their
&gt;      computer," it read. "On Christmas Day, 1998, the logic bomb part of
&gt;      this 'virus' will become active, wreaking havoc upon the entire
&gt;      planet's networks.
&gt;      
&gt;      "The virus can be stopped. But not by mortals."
&gt;      
&gt;      The note said an "antidote" program will be made available if hacker
&gt;      Kevin Mitnick is released. Mitnick was indicted last year on charges
&gt;      involving a multimillion-dollar crime wave in cyberspace.
&gt;      
&gt;      Diane Hunt, a spokeswoman for the company, said the message was up
&gt;      for only 10 to 15 minutes and a few thousand people saw it.
&gt;      
&gt;      "We immediately took action to see the extent of the damage and
&gt;      moved to correct it," she said. "And about that virus? There is, in
&gt;      fact, no virus."
&gt;      
&gt;      Yahoo! is a computer directory widely used for searching the
&gt;      Internet. The note appeared briefly in place of the Yahoo! home
&gt;      page, preventing people online from using the search engine, which
&gt;      got 17.2 million visits in October.
&gt;      
&gt;      Jonathan Wheat, manager of the Anti-Virus Lab at the National
&gt;      Computer Security Association, said it is at least theoretically
&gt;      possible to exploit security flaws on the Internet and implant such
&gt;      a virus. But he said he doubts this group of hackers -- already
&gt;      known to security experts -- pulled it off.
&gt;      
&gt;      "That's pretty much ridiculous," agreed Jamonn Campbell, an
&gt;      information security analyst at the association.
&gt;      
&gt;      Wheat said there was little reason to be concerned that the popular
&gt;      Web site was hacked.
&gt;      
&gt;      "A lot of Web sites get hacked constantly," he said. He said that
&gt;      while Yahoo! is a high-profile site and should be expected to have
&gt;      better security than most, "no site is completely hack-proof."
