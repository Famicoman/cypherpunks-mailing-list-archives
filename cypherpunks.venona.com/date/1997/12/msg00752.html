&gt; The required filter functionality is something like this in order of
&gt; desirability:
&gt; 
&gt; Accept the SMTP session.  Use an EHLO extension HASHCASH to say that
&gt; this server expects hashcash.  (Extended HELO is a method of
&gt; specifying SMTP extensions (I think)).  Accept the headers, and if a
&gt; valid hashcash postage is not included, hand off to the real
&gt; mailserver a site configurable bounce message.

I'm not sure this is doable. From what I've seen of the sendmail anti-spam
stuff and the SMTP protocol, you can't just accept the headers and then
decide whether not not to accept the rest; you either have to be able to
(at present) a) reject the message before you receive it based on the FROM
data (known spammers, bogus hostnames, etc); b) reject the messages before
you receive it based on the RCPT data (anti-relaying: is the recipient at
our site?); c) reject the message after you receive it. Obviously with
spam, you'd like to be able to reject it before it takes up bandwidth. So,
an extended protocol could require a CASH command from the client before
DATA will be accepted. The client could generate the cash on the fly, or
it could be grepped out of the headers. 

If you don't want to dink around with patching sendmail or whatever for an
extended protocol, then simply use a system-wide procmailrc to enforce
hashcash; procmail can generate bounces very easily (or rather, trick the
MTA into generating the bounce for it). Or, make requiring hashcash a
user-selectable option by having a publicly-available script which a user
can have included into his .procmailrc by setting some variable.

&gt; This still leaves open the question of the user generating their own
&gt; hashcash postage.  Again this could be problematic for neophytes.  One
&gt; solution is to include a URL for a web page including a javascript
&gt; hashcash generator -- this means that no new software must be
&gt; installed, the user cut and pastes the generated hashcash into their
&gt; message.

Two potentially simpler solutions: a) the client MTA could generate
hashcash on the fly as needed (like it generates Message-IDs); b) a filter
could be installed in place of the user's normal MTA which generates
hashcash. The latter is probably better (easier to implement). For
example, if the normal MTA is sendmail, then a fake sendmail could be
installed which is just a nasty little script which parses out the
recipients, generates a suitable hashcash token for each one, and inserts
the appropriate headers, and then passes the message off to the real
sendmail.

My preferred means of spam-blocking right now is a barrage of tests for
typical spams using procmail, combined with a reverse spam block. An
ordinary spam block is an address munge where something is added to the
address to make it undeliverable, so ordinary users have to unmunge your
address before they can mail you, i.e. andy@neptune.chem.uga.nospam.edu. A 
reverse spam block lets you use your real address for posts but requires
users to add something to your address to guarantee delivery. As my sig
indicates, if you add +spamsucks to my username, various spam filtering
features are deactivated. If I wanted to, I could bounce anything which
didn't have the +spamsucks in it. The recipe I use also uses lists of
"trusted" users (ones I don't do any spam testing on, so they don't need
the password) and "spammers" (we don't spam test these either, we just
make them bounce). Also will reject messages where I am bcc:ed (unless
from someone trusted or the password was used) or on a huge visible list
(again as before).

It works pretty darn good. I hardly get any spam. Most of what I get
bounces back to the sender with "User unknown". If the sender has a forged
From, then this at least bounces there, or to the site's postmaster, who
will likely take some action (but not complain to me because I don't
exist). If the From was completely bogus, then I get the bounce, but that
doesn't happen too often. I use this same system for the return address of
the cracker remailer (anon@anon.efga.org) and it works pretty well, though
as of late I am munging the return address for all USENET posts a la
mail2news_nospam@anon.lcs.mit.edu (which has been hugely effective); 
you're not supposed to reply anyway...

I would like to modify the nymserver so that users can set a reverse spam
blocking password, but just haven't gotten around to it. I'm pretty sure
it can be done, though.
