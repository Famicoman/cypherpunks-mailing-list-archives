The probability of innocent people getting in trouble with
this scheme is very high.

For example, a stray cat, a child, a curious bird or even a rat could
open the box and spread the infection.

If you do not do this stuff well enough, in a while the packaging
will break and leak. 

The most likely person to suffer will be you, anyway. I could not care
less about you, but these diseases are contagious.

&gt; I hear from anonymous correspondents that the following
&gt; technique has been successfully deployed among some militia
&gt; members and cypherpunks who fear raids on their private
&gt; property.  Apparently the technique was originally invented
&gt; by a biotech lab that the FDA was planning to shut down in an
&gt; uncivil manner when Kessler first came to power.  The
&gt; lab was never raided.
&gt; 
&gt; Preliminary: choose a suitable viral agent.  This may range
&gt; from a short, severe flu to Eubola, depending on the level
&gt; of deterrence desired and safety precautions you have available.
&gt; Long-latency debilitating diseases have also been suggested
&gt; as an especially effective deterrent that puts the property
&gt; owner at less risk of detection.  The property owner must 
&gt; obtain both the agent and an effective vaccine.
&gt; 
&gt; Step one: immunize household members against this agent.
&gt; 
&gt; Step two: create "tamper avenging" packages around the
&gt; house.  Make them very suspicious looking (gun lockers, 
&gt; boxes labeled "Danger: Toxic Materials", file folders
&gt; labeled "Assassination Schedule for December", and so on).  
&gt; Don't put them where guests, pets, and so on can get to them, 
&gt; but in places where the thugs will look.
&gt; 
&gt; Step two (detail): the tamper avenging package contains an 
&gt; invisible film of the viral agent in fluid adsorbed to a suitable
&gt; carrier.  The carrier is a clear, thin film of sponge-like material that 
&gt; produces a fine aerosol of virus containing fluid drops when
&gt; disturbed.  When the package is opened and disturbed, the
&gt; aerosol quickly shoots and and spreads throughout several
&gt; surrounding cubic meters.  Persons unprotected by immunization
&gt; or breathing masks are contaminated with high probability.
&gt; I've heard unconfirmed rumors of a special sponge material
&gt; that lasts for days, infecting a variety of government personnel
&gt; and contractors who come in contact with the evidence, and
&gt; in some cases, depending on the particular vector,
&gt; people they in turn come in intimate contact with. 
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously I have not provided enough useful information
&gt; in this post to propery implement this technique.  Don't
&gt; try this at home without the help of paid professionals
&gt; (who I hear are making a killing now with the recent
&gt; spate of raids against militias, patriot groups, cypherpunks,
&gt; and so on).
