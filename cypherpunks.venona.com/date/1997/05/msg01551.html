To be more clear, I should have mentioned in my last missive
that I'm thinking of a "liberty" right (to protect transactional
confidentiality) as opposed to a "privacy" or, to some extent,
"property" right.

&gt; I'm now more awake than I was before, and a little less
&gt; flippant, so let me try to respond to Marc's statement
&gt; saying my summary of his "views on privacy below are
&gt; just silly."
&gt; 
&gt; The initial question has to be not how you protect rights,
&gt; but how you define them. For example, we have a right
&gt; to speak freely; there should be strict limits on
&gt; government controls on free expression or the press.
&gt; The state has unique powers of coercion. Similarly,
&gt; there should be strict limits on government collection
&gt; of personal data about its citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; But transactional privacy is a different matter. Sure,
&gt; we may generally agree that privacy is the famous
&gt; "right to be left alone," but how does that extend to
&gt; what happens when I make an affirmative choice to
&gt; connect to a web site that might record some info
&gt; about my visit -- as an alternative to charging me?
&gt; Nobody's forcing me to visit that site. That's why
&gt; I'm starting to come around to the idea that privacy
&gt; is not a universal right but a preference. We need a
&gt; market in privacy, not inflexible FTC rulemaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and the much-touted European Privacy Directive has
&gt; made it near-impossible to exchange employee
&gt; information between branches of the same firm that are
&gt; physically in different countries. Bad move,
&gt; Eurocrats.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I spent a year working for a good crypto policy at the OECD.
&gt; &gt; During that time I watched European government officials
&gt; &gt; argue for constitutional freedoms and against key escrow,
&gt; &gt; while business representatives quietly backed the US
&gt; &gt; GAK plan. Welcome to the real world.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Btw - Declan's summary of our views on privacy below are
&gt; &gt; just silly. Many of the greatest defenders of First Amendment
&gt; &gt; freedoms have also felt most strongly about the right of
&gt; &gt; privacy. The question is always how you protect rights.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps libertarians would do away with all laws that protect
&gt; &gt; personal freedoms. Bad call.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Unfortunately, Tim is letting a rant get in the way of reality. A shame,

&gt; &gt; &gt;went to some cheezy Crystal City sports bar afterwards. I just got back
&gt; &gt; &gt;home, and it's 3:20 am...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, Rotenberg and EPIC are not the Uber Enemy. Rather, they disagree
&gt; &gt; &gt;with cypherpunk and libertarian positions on some issues. So we have
&gt; &gt; &gt;issue-by-issue alliances with them. Let's break it down:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt;CRYPTO: EPIC takes a purist civil liberties approach to crypto. They've
&gt; &gt; &gt;been the ones criticizing the SAFE "crypto in crime" provisions. Did the
&gt; &gt; &gt;latest VTW alert sent out today even mention that portion of the bill, let
&gt; &gt; &gt;alone criticize it?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;ANONYMITY: No other group in DC is such a staunch supporter of online
&gt; &gt; &gt;anonymity publicly, though look for something from Cato soon. In fact, I
&gt; &gt; &gt;linked to EPIC's copy of the McIntyre decision for my Friday Netly piece.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Many business groups don't like anonymity online -- hurts the marketeers.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;FREE SPEECH: EPIC is co-counsel in ACLU lawsuit against CDA. I believe
&gt; &gt; &gt;they've said some of the anti-spam legislation is unconstitutional.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;FOIA: David Sobel does fabulous work snagging government documents the
&gt; &gt; &gt;spooks don't want released.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;PRIVACY: EPIC wants more Federal involvement to protect privacy and a
&gt; &gt; &gt;Federal Privacy Commission (or something similar). Lots of laws,
&gt; &gt; &gt;bureaucracies. Though EPIC does realize there's a First Amendment; other
&gt; &gt; &gt;privacy groups are even more aggressive. EPIC is of course on the side of
&gt; &gt; &gt;libertarians when it comes to government violations of privacy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;From a libertarian perspective, EPIC is good on everything but privacy. On
&gt; &gt; &gt;that they want Big Government solutions.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;But that doesn't mean we reject and condemn what they do on other issues.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Do we reject Eagle Forum's anti-Clipper endorsement because they're a
&gt; &gt; &gt;bunch of ultraconservative wackos? Do we reject the National Organization
&gt; &gt; &gt;for Women's position on the CDA as bad because they're a bunch of
&gt; &gt; &gt;ultraliberal wackos? How about the National Association of Broadcaster's
&gt; &gt; &gt;amicus brief against the CDA? The Christian Coalition rejecting a national
&gt; &gt; &gt;ID cards and numbers? Ralph Nader wanting open access to government
&gt; &gt; &gt;databases?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;No. We don't. Instead, we address this issue by issue. EPIC and Rotenberg
&gt; &gt; &gt;are not always, but are often, our allies.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I suppose I am developing a reputation amongst the Inside the Beltway Cyber
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Rights Groups (tm) as a pain in the ass, but nearly everytime I see one of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their chief spokeswonks giving a policy statement I realize they are "not
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; on my side."
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The latest quote is from Marc Rotenberg, on a CNN piece on spam and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anti-spam legislation, saying that what the legislators in Congress really
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; need to look into is how the spammers develop their data bases.....
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Incredible. Does he propose investigations of private data gathering?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps search warrants served on those who take public postings and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; construct data bases?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Look, I'm annoyed by getting 5-10 "unwanted" spam messages a day. But I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realize the "spammers" are merely  taking publicly available (= legally
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; available, as 99.99% of all such information is) information and using
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; legal channels to contact me. I may not "like" it, but their behavior is as
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; legal as someone calling me on the phone.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (And ny nearly any measure of hassle factor, dashing to get to the phone
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; only to find it's a salesman selling something I don't want is worse than
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; any 20 unwanted e-mail messages.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So, Marc Rotenberg wants Congress to "look into" (= interfere with)
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; compilation and use of public information.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; These people are NOT our allies.
