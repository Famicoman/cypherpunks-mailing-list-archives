&gt; &gt;  We put up with crap from our government that we wouldn't accept from
&gt; &gt;someone trying to sell us a mouthwash. The reason that we're not all
&gt; &gt;drinking the "New Coke" is that D.C. has siphoned off all of the spin
&gt; &gt;doctors/brainwashers from the corporate advertising industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Well there must be a few spin-doctors left as we are drinking "New Coke".
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; The whole "New Coke/Orriginal Coke" was one of the best con jobs I have
&gt; ever seen. The Coca-Cola Company had a small problem, the cost of sugar.
&gt; It's compitition was using corn suryp as a sweetner in their products which
&gt; was much cheaper than the sugar Coca-Cola was using in theirs.
&gt; 
&gt; Now how were they going to switch from sugar to corn suryp in Coke without
&gt; lossing a portion of their customers because of the change in taste? NEW
&gt; COKE!!
&gt; 
&gt; Here is what they did:
&gt; 
&gt; Come out with NEW COKE which was a major formula change.
&gt; Drop OLD COKE at the same time.
&gt; Wait a few months while the natives are restless over the change. Bring
&gt; back "OLD COKE" due to customer demmand (making Coca-Cola Inc. the "good"
&gt; guys). Don't tell anyone that you have switched from sugar to corn suryp
&gt; (the sheep will never notice).
&gt; 
&gt; Vola!! Now Coca-Cola has dramatically increased their profits and won a
&gt; major PR campain (they care about their customers) sales are up costs are
&gt; down and the sheep are happy.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I have NEVER seen the neanderthals in DC ever pull off somthing this
&gt; good. :)

  I guess that if their spin-doctors had been involved in the
cypherpunks
list takeover, that we would all have golden images of Sameer on our
computers.
