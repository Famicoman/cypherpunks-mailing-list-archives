In &lt;<A HREF="msg00200.html">Pine.LNX.3.91.970505102129.509B-100000@fatmans.demon.co.uk</A>&gt;, on

   Paul Bradley &lt;paul@fatmans.demon.co.uk&gt; said:




&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A ban on all handguns even when registered (currently all pistols above 
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; .22 are banned and all guns have to be registered in a process whereby if 
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the applicant for a certificate has any history of political dissention 
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or crime (eg. Smoking a joint, the ultimate sin against society) the 
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; certificate will be refused.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What would be an example of such political dissention?

&gt;Well, I`m pretty sure that, having recently been involved in campaigns 
&gt;against the ban on handguns, written to a number of people in positions 
&gt;of power over the proposed TTP scheme in the DTI white paper etc. my 
&gt;firearms licence will not be renewed the next time it comes up for review.
&gt;The powers that be now presumably see me as a loon.

&gt;A damning enditement on the British people is that last time I mentioned 
&gt;to someone my having written to the home office and others over the 
&gt;proposed gun ban I was called a lunatic and told "The sort of person who 
&gt;writes to the home office over something like that is the least suitable 
&gt;to have a gun".

&gt;I can assure you this is not a one-off, this happens every time people who
&gt; don`t shoot find out I do. They have been brainwashed by the  tabloid
&gt;press, for example, the daily mail ran a particularly vitriolic  hate
&gt;campaign against gun owners singling out Albie Fox, leader of the 
&gt;campaign against the ban, and calling him a "Gun obsessed lunatic". This,
&gt;recall, is the same daily mail which rants every day about the  "evil of
&gt;drugs" and how the only way to "save society" is to throw  everyone who
&gt;doesn`t support their particular brand of bigoted fanaticism  into jail
&gt;for the rest of their life.

&gt;And of course, one would imagine that those who actually owned guns and 
&gt;used them for sport themselves would be the most informed people who 
&gt;would realise that the criminal use of guns is at the opposite end of the 
&gt;scale to the sporting use allowed in British law. However, I know several 
&gt;people who have said "I`m happy to give up my guns if it will save 
&gt;lives", to this I simply reply "who were you going to kill?" then walk 
&gt;away, these people don`t even deserve correcting as their bullshit is so 
&gt;deep.

&gt;In addition, when the police revoke or refuse to renew a firearms 
&gt;certificate, they do not need to give a reason, so one cannot even prove 
&gt;that it was because of speech or opinions they didn`t like that they 
&gt;revoked the certificate. Even if you could, it is unlikely a challenge in 
&gt;court would succeed, the UK does not have the same free speech guarantees 
&gt;as are given in the US and elsewhere, and any court challenge would fail, 
&gt;of that I am sure.

&gt;Also, to worsen the situation, the labour party has now come to power and 
&gt;as I have already explained in a previous post this make matters even
&gt;worse.

Well wait until after the next elections when we have a Republican
administration and apply for political asylum. :)

Someday the revolution will come and we can roundup all these bastards for
"crimes against Democracy". Anyone for Nurnburg II? --
