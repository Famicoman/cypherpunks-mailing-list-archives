&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that it is you Kent who is scrambling to find plausible

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not "best".  "Easiest".  Look at it this way, Adam -- if it was easy 
&gt; &gt; to implement Carl's model, it would already have happened, given the 
&gt; &gt; dislike of key-escrow in the cryptographic community.  
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly: have you done a comprehensive survey of corporate access
&gt; systems available to commerce.

No.  I personally have not.  People I know have, though -- the survey 
was completed about -- um -- a year and a half ago, I guess.  So it 
is somewhat out of date.

&gt; Secondly: there are a number of other forces "encouraging" the GAK
&gt; model.  Government incentives: Europe companies and research groups
&gt; get given research funding to experiment with GAK/TTP architectures.
&gt; Either the architecture is stipulated as part of the call for
&gt; proposals, or proposals involving GAK are going to get funding more
&gt; easily.

That's a good point.

&gt; Third: people involved with key recovery at all have tended to be
&gt; defense contractor types, who are more likely to go with government
&gt; "standards" (such as TTPs/clipper/tessera/etc).

I'm not so sure about this.

&gt; &gt; But, when examined in detail, in light of real requirements from
&gt; &gt; organizations, it is not easy at all.
&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that PGP Inc had done it, or is working on
&gt; it.

This is one reason I'm not so sure -- PGP Inc is not a defense contractor.

&gt;  It's not very hard at all, all you need is PGP's existing
&gt; multiple crypto-recipient feature.

If you believe all your employees will correctly use the proper PGP
incantation each and every time, even when they are tired and haven't
had coffee for 4 hours, and their kid is sick, and their wife is mad
about something, then yes, it is simple.  But of course, that is not
realistic.  Employees are forgetful, the organizations goals are not
their goals, and the PGP UI is -- well, I find it a little awkward, 
at times.

So PGP's multiple recipient feature is a fundamental building block, 
but you need something more in a crypto-client to be sure that 
company policy is followed.  It's that "somthing more" that is the 
hard part.

And lest we get into the macho programmer argument -- of course it's 
just a mere matter of design and programming.

&gt; The storage of your company master key needs some thought, but that's
&gt; a common problem with either your crypto key safe model or multiple
&gt; recipient model.
[...]
&gt; I'm not sure that multiple recipient is that much less useful to GAK
&gt; than the safe model, buf if it is at all less useful, and the systems
&gt; otherwise basically equivalent I would argue against the safe model
&gt; for that reason alone.  However I consider the safe model inferior in
&gt; several areas neglecting this issue anyway.
[...]
&gt; I contend that there are similar and mostly comparable problems with
&gt; the safe model.  Lets take a look at a few:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With this background, perhaps now you can see why I say that Carl's 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution doesn't even address the problem.  The problem is management 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of complexity.  Carl says "encrypt to Acme Corp".  Who in Acme Corp?  
&gt; 
&gt; Kent says give all the keys to Acme corp, or let Acme corp generate
&gt; the keys.  Who is Acme Corp?

The company that bought the crypto software for the protection of 
company secrets.  I think I said "who *in* Acme Corp", though, as a 
prelude to the following points, because with the multiple recipient 
model there is a policy decision as to which key in Acme is the 
master.  

&gt; The next bit is as a result of multiple recipient being more flexible
&gt; than the safe model as stated.  We now have freedom to allow different
&gt; elements in the company to audit and access different departments
&gt; communications.  Naturally this extra flexibility results in policy
&gt; decisions.

Yes.  To make use of this flexibility you now need a piece of software
that allows you to produce policy decisions, sign them, and make them
visible to all the crypto clients.  Another mere matter of design and
programming.  And this bit of sortware needs to operate securely -- 
you can't just any joe blow subverting it.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What part of the organization that is Acme Corp is authorized to know 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this particular bit of information?  Because some of the employees 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are idiots you want this built automatically into the application 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are using for encryption/email/whatever.  How does this software 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know what policy is appropriate for which employee?  How is that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy distributed?  What is the interface that allows a policy to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defined?   How do you protect the policy definition from subversion?
&gt; 
&gt; If making policy decisions is too complex in your view for
&gt; implementation or practicality, well just substitute a policy dumbed
&gt; down to the level of the safe model.  Ie there is one crypto
&gt; recipient, all company communications _must_ be encrytped to it as a
&gt; second crypto recipient.


You are right -- there is the degenerate case where the master key is
fixed.  However, I would contend that is *very* bad crypto design.  So
thus you have the problem of distributing information about a revoked
master key.  (Your solution, below, was that you have a signed policy
statement.  If you have a security breach, and are revoking a master
key, how do you know what signature to trust?)

Furthermore, by encrypting every document to the same master key you
have actually vastly increased your exposure -- a key-safe can have a
lot of special-purpose physical and cryptographic security, but the
master key in the multiple recipient model is almost certainly treated
the same as all other keys.  For example, in the key-safe model I can
just hand someone the master key on a floppy, and it doesn't do them
any good, because they can't get to the key-safe -- it is physically
secure.  Next I walk into the physically secure facility (I, as keeper
of the keys, have legitimate access), and change the master key.  No
security problem, no documents have been compromised, regardless of
their physical location or access.  With the multiple recipient model
if I hand out the master key, every visible encrypted document is
immediately and irrevocably compromised.  So the key-safe model 
allows you a far greater security for your data than the multiple 
recipient model.

&gt; Policy distribution is something Netscape has been doing; apparently
&gt; the difference between it's browsers is largely a signed policy file
&gt; with a mildly obfuscated public verification key check in the code.

Completely different environment, of course -- I saw some traffic 
where they admitted that probably without too much effort 
the policy could be subverted.  But I don't deny that it would be 
possible to build a policy distribution scheme -- but it is a 
non-trivial problem.

&gt; I'm sure you can arrange this same flexibility and bring in the
&gt; baggage of the policy decisions that come with it for the safe model
&gt; also if you want it.  Store keys for different departments in
&gt; different safes.  Give the master keys for the department to the
&gt; department head, etc.,etc.  Same problem, similar policy decisions,
&gt; right?

Nope.  Not at all.  The policy for multiple recipients needs to be
interpreted by the crypto clients.  But in the key-safe model policy
is almost entirely in human hands.  It doesn't even have to be written
down.  

Modestly secure example: The keysafe runs on a single workstation,
hardened similar to a firewall.  The only network connections are to a
single port, which does the cryptographically secure key storing
protocol.  When a key needs to be recovered, three trusted employees
troop into the room (three passwords are required, these passwords are
essentially the master key), and retrieve the needed key on a floppy. 
Other than the authentication protocol, there is *no* policy embedded
in the key-safe, which is to say, *any* policy the company wants to
use is ok.  It may take the personal presence of the company
president, it may take a signed statement from operations staff,
whatever.  No policy is embedded in software, and no software to
support software needs to be written. 

&gt; &gt; The key-safe model has no significant policy issues that need to be
&gt; &gt; embedded in software -- the only policy is "when data encryption
&gt; &gt; keys are generated a copy is sent to the key-safe (using an
&gt; &gt; encrypted channel, of course)."
&gt; 
&gt; As stated above, this is because you have chosen a single master key
&gt; to go with the safe model.  If you choose a single crypto-recipient,
&gt; and master key encrypting the private half of that key, you largely
&gt; have equivalence.

Not so, as I hopefully explained above, the key-safe can have enhance 
security, so that the danger of a compromise is lessened.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see the difference.  With the encrypt to multiple recipients
&gt; &gt; &gt; approach where the second crypto-recipient is the company key you can
&gt; &gt; &gt; store the private half of the corporate key using the same techniques
&gt; &gt; &gt; you discussed above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Access to the data requires access to the master key in both cases.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It follows, therefore, that if the master key is compromised in both
&gt; &gt; systems, all data is compromised.  From that perspective, the systems
&gt; &gt; are equally secure. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or similarly insecure.  They are quite similar, I think multiple
&gt; recipient offers more flexibility, and security advantages, as well as
&gt; avoiding the sharing of private keys.

I spoke too soon here.  The key-safe model is intrinsically more 
secure.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You fix the second crypto-recipient in the MUA if you wish to.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is precisely the point I was alluding to in the policy discussion
&gt; &gt; above.  In an organizational content, *of course* you will put all the
&gt; &gt; complexity in the MUA.  The question is, how do you change the 
&gt; &gt; "master key" indicator that is in each MUA?  Suppose that the 
&gt; &gt; organization wants different keys for different departments -- how do 
&gt; &gt; you keep track of which master key goes where?  How do all those 
&gt; &gt; MUA's get their key policy module updated?
&gt; 
&gt; Sign the policy file.  Certify the signing key(s).  You're going to
&gt; have this anway for authentication of email content.

You may not be able to trust the signature.
[...]

&gt; &gt; &gt;  You
&gt; &gt; &gt; can use binding cryptography to ensure the fire-wall can tell that it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is an encrypted copy of the same document without the firewall needing
&gt; &gt; &gt; access to the master key.  You can't do this company has all keys in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the safe model, without givin the firewall automatic access to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; safe, which is a huge security risk.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ???
&gt; &gt; With the key-safe model the firewall never enters into the picture.
&gt; 
&gt; It does for the same functionality.  With the key-safe model how do
&gt; you know that the ciphertexts flowing out of the building are
&gt; encrypted with a key that is in your safe at all?

Oh -- I'm sorry.  I didn't think through what you were saying.  You
were attempting to guard against an insider threat.  A waste of time,
probably.  He could frisbee a floppy out the window to his honey in
the red sports car. 

&gt; You don't have to do the binding cryptography stuff with multiple
&gt; recipients if you don't want to.  With the safe model you can't do it
&gt; even if you do want to.

How does the firewall know what is encrypted?  Just a bunch of gifs 
of the family?  Just the first 5000 lines of "Paradise Lost", slightly 
altered? 

Anyway, if the employee uses the "approved" MUA, and it isn't 
compromised, then it can store a copy of all outgoing mail, encrypted 
with the employee's key.  If he doesn't use the approved MUA, or the 
MUA is compromised, then of course the firewall protections are 
useless.  So, in the keysafe model, the firewall never enters the 
picture -- it is all handled in the MUA, anyway.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The advantage of the multiple recipient model is that doesn't commit
&gt; &gt; &gt; the cardinal sin/design flaw of sharing private crypto keys.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Two things:  First, any crypto system that doesn't deal with 
&gt; &gt; protection/recovery/secure-use of private keys is incomplete.
&gt; 
&gt; For storage encryption keys where backups are not plaintext, I agree.
&gt; For communication keys, you do not need to backup.  Doing so weakens
&gt; security.  Communications keys should be transient, forward secret
&gt; even.  Authentication keys should be persistent, back up not required,
&gt; just generate new key, and new certificates if lost.  Storage keys
&gt; should be backed up where necessary.

I agree with all this.  Only storage keys need to be in the keysafe.
