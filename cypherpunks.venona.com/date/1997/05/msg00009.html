Status Report on SADE, "Serenity and Dignity Through Enlightenment"


FLASH! The Center for Deities and Theologies announces that the "SADE" Bill
is past markup by the House Committee on Beliefs and Creeds, and is headed
for passage in the full House. We urge you to call your representative and
support this important Bill.

While CDT believes the Bill has certain flaws, particularly the criminal
sanctions for use of religious beliefs in furtherance of a prosecutable
offense, we believe the benefits outweigh the problems. This Bill will give
to American believer-units the religious freedoms they have so far lacked,
while also ensuring the legitimate needs of religious enforcement are
satisfied.

The characterization of SADE as a kind of "hold a belief, go to prison" law
is completely unjustified. No believer-unit who does not use his or her
beliefs in connection with a prosecutable offense has anything whatsoever
to fear from this  landmark piece of legislation. 

CDT is proud to be a supporter and industry shill for this important step
forward.

--Klaus! von Future Prime, Policy Director, Center for Deities and Theologies
