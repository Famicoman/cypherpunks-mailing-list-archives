&gt; &gt; It seems to me that it is you Kent who is scrambling to find plausible

&gt; 
&gt; Not "best".  "Easiest".  Look at it this way, Adam -- if it was easy 
&gt; to implement Carl's model, it would already have happened, given the 
&gt; dislike of key-escrow in the cryptographic community.  

Firstly: have you done a comprehensive survey of corporate access
systems available to commerce.

Secondly: there are a number of other forces "encouraging" the GAK
model.  Government incentives: Europe companies and research groups
get given research funding to experiment with GAK/TTP architectures.
Either the architecture is stipulated as part of the call for
proposals, or proposals involving GAK are going to get funding more
easily.

Third: people involved with key recovery at all have tended to be
defense contractor types, who are more likely to go with government
"standards" (such as TTPs/clipper/tessera/etc).

&gt; But, when examined in detail, in light of real requirements from
&gt; organizations, it is not easy at all.

I was under the impression that PGP Inc had done it, or is working on
it.  It's not very hard at all, all you need is PGP's existing
multiple crypto-recipient feature.

The storage of your company master key needs some thought, but that's
a common problem with either your crypto key safe model or multiple
recipient model.

&gt; I'm not "scrambling", Adam.  If there is anything you need to
&gt; understand here, it is that I am *not* in favor of GAK.  

I have a memory.  I recall you made several posts where-in you said
you were against GAK.  Your line of argument seems to be that the rest
of us are misguided, or are allowing are dislike of GAK to cloud our
judgement on what a good crypto architecture GAK would be applied to
corporate key escrow.  Right?

&gt; Chisel that in stone and think about it a bit -- your
&gt; misunderstanding of my motives causes you to gloss over my arguments
&gt; and not think about them.  I am sympathetic to your concerns, and I
&gt; am trying to explain something I truly think people are missing.
&gt; Think of me as intelligent, Adam, and I will do the same for you.

I have no doubts as to your intelligence.  I understand what you are
trying to explain, and understood the first time you tried to explain;
I just disagree!  If you want to discuss your motives, the thing that
puzzles me is that your tone, overall apparent statist tendencies, and
zest on this topic are at odds with your stance on GAK.  Did you ever
come across a guy called David Sternlight?  (Clearly an intelligent
guy, but having a tendency to hang on to arguments, and stir up flame
wars, in his case I'm sure this was intentional.)  Not equating you to
Sternlight, though there are some similarities in style.

Perhaps it is just that some of us reacted negatively when you first
bought this topic up, and you are still acting in retaliatorily
hostile manner as a result of this.  Remember it was you who called
for rational calm discussion.  People impute from your apparent
statist leanings, and your arguments against people who are against
the key-safe model because of the possibility of helping build a GAK
infrastructure that you are pro-GAK.  Perhaps you need to disclaim
this more clearly.

If I believed GAK architecture was superior to multiple-recipient, and
was arguing this I don't think I'd come across in the same way.

I'm not sure that multiple recipient is that much less useful to GAK
than the safe model, buf if it is at all less useful, and the systems
otherwise basically equivalent I would argue against the safe model
for that reason alone.  However I consider the safe model inferior in
several areas neglecting this issue anyway.

&gt; &gt; &gt; [claimed unique and fatally complex problems with multiple 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recipient approach]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ah I see you do acknowledge what Carl Ellison and Matt Blaze have been
&gt; &gt; saying on cryptography@c2, that key escrow has complexity problems,
&gt; &gt; contrary to what you have previously been arguing :-)
&gt; 
&gt; You completely missed the point of the above paragraph -- all those
&gt; questions apply to the "encrypt to policy-specified local recipients"
&gt; model, and *don't* apply to the key-safe model.  

I contend that there are similar and mostly comparable problems with
the safe model.  Lets take a look at a few:

&gt; &gt; &gt; With this background, perhaps now you can see why I say that Carl's 
&gt; &gt; &gt; solution doesn't even address the problem.  The problem is management 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of complexity.  Carl says "encrypt to Acme Corp".  Who in Acme Corp?  

Kent says give all the keys to Acme corp, or let Acme corp generate
the keys.  Who is Acme Corp?

The next bit is as a result of multiple recipient being more flexible
than the safe model as stated.  We now have freedom to allow different
elements in the company to audit and access different departments
communications.  Naturally this extra flexibility results in policy
decisions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What part of the organization that is Acme Corp is authorized to know 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this particular bit of information?  Because some of the employees 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are idiots you want this built automatically into the application 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they are using for encryption/email/whatever.  How does this software 
&gt; &gt; &gt; know what policy is appropriate for which employee?  How is that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; policy distributed?  What is the interface that allows a policy to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; defined?   How do you protect the policy definition from subversion?

If making policy decisions is too complex in your view for
implementation or practicality, well just substitute a policy dumbed
down to the level of the safe model.  Ie there is one crypto
recipient, all company communications _must_ be encrytped to it as a
second crypto recipient.

Policy distribution is something Netscape has been doing; apparently
the difference between it's browsers is largely a signed policy file
with a mildly obfuscated public verification key check in the code.

I'm sure you can arrange this same flexibility and bring in the
baggage of the policy decisions that come with it for the safe model
also if you want it.  Store keys for different departments in
different safes.  Give the master keys for the department to the
department head, etc.,etc.  Same problem, similar policy decisions,
right?

&gt; The key-safe model has no significant policy issues that need to be
&gt; embedded in software -- the only policy is "when data encryption
&gt; keys are generated a copy is sent to the key-safe (using an
&gt; encrypted channel, of course)."

As stated above, this is because you have chosen a single master key
to go with the safe model.  If you choose a single crypto-recipient,
and master key encrypting the private half of that key, you largely
have equivalence.

&gt; &gt; I don't see the difference.  With the encrypt to multiple recipients
&gt; &gt; approach where the second crypto-recipient is the company key you can
&gt; &gt; store the private half of the corporate key using the same techniques
&gt; &gt; you discussed above.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Access to the data requires access to the master key in both cases.
&gt; 
&gt; It follows, therefore, that if the master key is compromised in both
&gt; systems, all data is compromised.  From that perspective, the systems
&gt; are equally secure. 

Or similarly insecure.  They are quite similar, I think multiple
recipient offers more flexibility, and security advantages, as well as
avoiding the sharing of private keys.

&gt; &gt; You fix the second crypto-recipient in the MUA if you wish to.
&gt; 
&gt; This is precisely the point I was alluding to in the policy discussion
&gt; above.  In an organizational content, *of course* you will put all the
&gt; complexity in the MUA.  The question is, how do you change the 
&gt; "master key" indicator that is in each MUA?  Suppose that the 
&gt; organization wants different keys for different departments -- how do 
&gt; you keep track of which master key goes where?  How do all those 
&gt; MUA's get their key policy module updated?

Sign the policy file.  Certify the signing key(s).  You're going to
have this anway for authentication of email content.

&gt; &gt;  The
&gt; &gt; fire-wall can reject posts without the second crypto-recipient.
&gt; 
&gt; How does the key policy module in the firewall get updated?

Sign it too.

&gt; &gt;  You
&gt; &gt; can use binding cryptography to ensure the fire-wall can tell that it
&gt; &gt; is an encrypted copy of the same document without the firewall needing
&gt; &gt; access to the master key.  You can't do this company has all keys in
&gt; &gt; the safe model, without givin the firewall automatic access to the
&gt; &gt; safe, which is a huge security risk.
&gt; 
&gt; ???
&gt; With the key-safe model the firewall never enters into the picture.

It does for the same functionality.  With the key-safe model how do
you know that the ciphertexts flowing out of the building are
encrypted with a key that is in your safe at all?

You don't have to do the binding cryptography stuff with multiple
recipients if you don't want to.  With the safe model you can't do it
even if you do want to.

&gt; &gt; The advantage of the multiple recipient model is that doesn't commit
&gt; &gt; the cardinal sin/design flaw of sharing private crypto keys.
&gt; 
&gt; Two things:  First, any crypto system that doesn't deal with 
&gt; protection/recovery/secure-use of private keys is incomplete.

For storage encryption keys where backups are not plaintext, I agree.
For communication keys, you do not need to backup.  Doing so weakens
security.  Communications keys should be transient, forward secret
even.  Authentication keys should be persistent, back up not required,
just generate new key, and new certificates if lost.  Storage keys
should be backed up where necessary.

&gt; &gt; The `it's easier to explain a safe full of all employee keys' to
&gt; &gt; management argument is nonsense also.  It's a master key either way
&gt; &gt; and just as easy to explain either way: a master key is a key that
&gt; &gt; lets you decrypt all mail.
&gt; 
&gt; At that level of generality both these systems are identical, and 
&gt; equally easy to explain.  It's when you get down to the details that 
&gt; things become more interesting.

With the safe model, to allow access to outgoing mail, you'll have to
encrypt to a company key as second crypto-recipient, or to yourself,
thereby allowing company access through access to your key.  Quite
similar to multiple recipient.  Similar explanation.
