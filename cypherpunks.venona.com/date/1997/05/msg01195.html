&gt;&gt; Notable example:  the Malibu doctor suspected--wrongly, it turns out--of
&gt;&gt; growing pot on his ranch. He and his wife were startled by the ninjas
&gt;&gt; bursting into their bedroom. The doctor reached for a handgun in his
&gt;&gt; nightstand and was sprayed with 9mms from the Heckler and Kock MP-5s of the
&gt;&gt; raiders. The estate of the doctor is currently suing the LA County
&gt;&gt; Sheriff's Department and other agencies, but you know how those things go.
&gt;&gt; I know I shock a lot of people by saying this, but I think those involved
&gt;&gt; in the raid should be tried on murder charges and, if found guilty,
&gt;&gt; executed promptly. And if the court system won't do this, which it
&gt;&gt; obviously won't, then the alternative is &lt;CENSORED CENSORED CENSORED
&gt;&gt; CENSORED&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;This is quite right, the police had no right to be in his house as he had 
&gt;commited no ethical crime, therefore he merely attempted to defend 
&gt;himself against people who had broken into his house. If they then shot 
&gt;him they are guilty of murder, no question about it.

The interesting thing is that the envirocrats wanted the land, and the
sheriff (who is, BTW, not in jail) got an appraisal on it BEFORE the
raid. This case, and not Ruby Ridge, Waco, or The Reichsta...um..
OK City, radicalized me. This man (Donald Scott) did NOTHING to
deserve his murder, and the crooks who killed him deserve death.

&gt;If the government want a "war on drugs" they can expect a real war, where 
&gt;the enemy fight back. 
&gt;
&gt;All of those fortunate enough to be living someone where they are legally 
&gt;entitled to obtain defensive weapons, Lock and load.

Yes, and buy components. These will be outlawed before they go for
guns as such, in the hope that wear and tear will do their grab for them.
