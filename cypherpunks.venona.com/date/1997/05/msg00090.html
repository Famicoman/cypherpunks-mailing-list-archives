Two quick points:

* I think the discussion centered around CDT since they put out a policy
post a few hours after the SAFE markup earlier this week, and that policy
post was well-circulated online.

* Didn't CDT, unlike the other groups like EPIC/ACLU/EFF/ATR, send a
letter to the House subcommittee on April 29 urging that SAFE be approved
without any changes? (I'm in Oklahoma right now and I have a copy of that
letter in my office in DC, but that's what I remember.)

On Thu, 1 May 1997, Shabbir J. Safdar wrote:

&gt; The Administration hates this bill, because it threatens their ability to
&gt; roll out Key Recovery.  They've said as much in the letter Declan forwarded:
&gt; 
&gt;    "The bill could be read as prohibiting the United States government
&gt;     from using appropriate incentives to support a key management
&gt;     infrastructure and KEY RECOVERY." [emphasis added]
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think that if this bill helped the Administration, that they'd be
&gt; out there urging the subcommittee chairman to stop it?  I think not.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also puzzled by the fact that CDT is being criticized pretty much
&gt; solely, even though the entire Internet Privacy Coalition, and several
&gt; other groups all wrote a letter of support of the bill with only a
&gt; criticism of one provision.  However the overall statement was of support.
&gt; (see <A  HREF="http://www.privacy.org/ipc/safe_letter.html">http://www.privacy.org/ipc/safe_letter.html</A>)
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I can tell, everyone criticizing the bill either thinks that:
&gt; 
&gt; 	a) CDT actually runs all these groups behind the scenes, or
&gt; 	b) pretty much all of the Internet advocates believe that this bill
&gt;            is needed and are doing the best they can with what Congress has
&gt;            written.
&gt; 
&gt; You're pretty hard on CDT, but EFF, EPIC, the ACLU, VTW, Americans for Tax
&gt; Reform, the Association for Computing Machinery, Computer Professionals for
&gt; Social Responsiblity, Eagle Forum, the National Association for Criminal
&gt; Defense Lawyers, and PGP Inc all signed this letter.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you consider, perhaps, for a second, that critics of SAFE are being
&gt; unreasonable?  I would think so, as critics of SAFE include the Clinton
&gt; Administration.  Is that the kind of company that cypherpunks keep?
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a great excerpt from the Internet Privacy Coalition letter:
&gt; 
&gt;   The pending bill provides a positive framework for the reforms that are
&gt;   long overdue in this critical area. It makes clear that the sale or use
&gt; of
&gt;   encryption, a vital technique to promote network security and individual
&gt;   privacy, should not be restricted in the United States. This is the view
&gt;   widely shared by users of the Internet and the computer and communications
&gt;   industry. It was also a central recommendation of the
&gt;   report of the National Research Council last year.
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like widespread support from people who study this issue for living.
&gt; I'm glad to be counted among them.
