&gt; &gt; Hmm.  I did read, and I thought I understood this.  I claim that if
&gt; &gt; the remailers collude, then there in no anonymity.  Correct?
&gt; 
&gt; Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Even if I insert my own remailer in the list it doesn't help, if the
&gt; &gt; others are all in cahoots.  This seems pretty obvious.  They all
&gt; &gt; compare logs, and saved copies of the messages, and my message can
&gt; &gt; be tracked from beginning to end.  Right?
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong. One trusted mix is enough to guarantee anonymity: There is a
&gt; large number of fixed-size messages coming in and a large number of
&gt; messages going out in random order.  (Consult the archives for
&gt; information about possible attacks, such as flooding a remailer with
&gt; dummy messages, and how to detect/prevent them.)

"Guarantee" is a strong word, wouldn't you say? Simple case: you have
two messages; one you know I wrote, the other I didn't, you don't know
which.  You could say that is "anonymity".  That's a reasonable use 
of the term.  But it wouldn't make me feel secure.  So that boils 
down to what is a "large" number.  (I confess I *haven't* read the 
archives about flooding attacks.  However, I don't see how they could 
be guarded against if *all* the other remailers are in collusion.  
But perhaps that case has been considered...)

&gt; &gt; I see a list of remailers posted on cypherpunks periodically -- a
&gt; &gt; "cypherpunks" approved list, therefore.  Lucky Green admits publically
&gt; &gt; that he personally knows several of the remailer operators.
&gt; 
&gt; So you say Raph actually *is* part of the cypherpunk conspirary??!

Of course.  I don't know Raph from Adam -- *I* just see a list posted
on cypherpunks.  For that matter, of course, you could be Tim May, as
are all the "(T)ruth (M)ongers", and many other of the "personalities"
on this list... 

&gt; BTW, that list is the "list of reliable remailers", not the "list of
&gt; cypherpunk approved remailers".  Now guess how a remailer qualifies to
&gt; be listed.

J E Hoover certified them?  If I persist in my conspiracy theory, 
then it makes absolutely no difference how they qualify -- the list 
is just text produced by the cp conspiracy, after all, creatively 
edited to make it look legit.

But seriously, I thought it was buy sending "ping" messages through 
them -- is there something more to it?

&gt; &gt; And clearly, remailer operators must share a common ideological
&gt; &gt; focus...
&gt; 
&gt; Remailer operators share the belief that it must be possible to use
&gt; the net anonymously, without leaving traces.  Is that what you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; PS: Did you know that one remailer operator formerly was a soldier in
&gt; East Germany's National People's Army?

How do you know that?  And why should I believe you?

Anyway, Ulf, as I said in my previous message, this was all started by
me poking fun of my "contemptible" status among the cyphperpunks. 
That status is partially fueled by the fact that I work for that evil
conspiracy, the "government".  (In all honesty, I must confess that it
may also be partially fueled by various failings of my own.)
