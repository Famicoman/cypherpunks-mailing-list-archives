&gt;Judge bans Internet gambling company from operating in Missouri

&gt;
&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo. (May 25, 1997 00:31 a.m. EDT) -- A Missouri judge
&gt;on Friday banned an Internet gambling company from operating in the
&gt;state.
&gt;
&gt;The Jackson County ruling places Missouri in the forefront of an
&gt;emerging national debate that will determine whether cyber gambling
&gt;fades or evolves into a $10 billion-a-year business, as some
&gt;industry analysts project.
&gt;
&gt;Visiting St. Francois County Circuit Judge Stan L. Murphy also
&gt;ordered that Interactive Gaming &amp; Communications Corp. pay more than
&gt;$66,000 in fines and legal expenses. Interactive Gaming has refused
&gt;and plans to take its fight to federal court.
&gt;
&gt;Among other terms Murphy imposed on Interactive Gaming, which
&gt;operates out of Blue Bell, Pa.:
&gt;
&gt;- Interactive Gaming cannot market, offer or promote gambling in
&gt;Missouri.
&gt;
&gt;- Interactive Gaming must post a notice on its home page that
&gt;Missouri residents cannot register to gamble, and it must immediately
&gt;reject any who try. It must also notify the state attorney general if
&gt;anyone does try to register.
&gt;
&gt;- At its expense, the company must provide any of its computer
&gt;records or office records for any audits requested by Missouri
&gt;Attorney General Jay Nixon.
&gt;
&gt;The judge also found that Interactive Gaming's subsidiary, Global
&gt;Casinos Ltd. in the Caribbean, is a mere "alter ego" of the
&gt;Pennsylvania firm. Interactive Gaming uses offshore gambling
&gt;accounts to try to circumvent Missouri law, he ruled. His ruling
&gt;applies to only Interactive Gaming and Global.
&gt;
&gt;About 20 offshore companies offer gambling on the Internet and more
&gt;are coming, said Sue Schneider, managing editor of Rolling Good
&gt;Times OnLine, an Internet news service. Slot machines, card games,
&gt;roulette and other casino-style games can be played after
&gt;establishing a cash account that is drawn on during play.
&gt;
&gt;Nixon said he would watch for any other companies operating in
&gt;Missouri and act on any complaints against them.
&gt;
&gt;He said this was the first time in the United States that an ongoing
&gt;Internet gambling operation had been sued and stopped. He said the
&gt;company violated state gambling laws. The gambling business never
&gt;gained momentum in the state, because Nixon last month filed a
&gt;restraining order against it.
&gt;
&gt;The issue of Internet gambling is getting attention elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt;In Wisconsin, a state case is pending in which the state sued a
&gt;company that was about to start. A federal case also is pending in
&gt;Wisconsin in which a gambling company has sued to get a judgment on
&gt;whether Internet gambling is legal. A bill to make Internet gambling
&gt;illegal failed in Congress last year; a similar measure is pending
&gt;this year.
&gt;
&gt;As more Internet gambling companies open or announce plans to start,
&gt;Nixon said, "they are watching our case and the one in Wisconsin."
&gt;
&gt;Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Hirsch, who represents the company,
&gt;said Friday that the fight between Nixon and Interactive Gaming just
&gt;started.
&gt;
&gt;"We'll send them a lawsuit in federal court," Hirsch said. "They're
&gt;trying to murder a legitimate business."
&gt;
&gt;The company will put the warning on its Internet site that Missouri
&gt;residents are forbidden to play, he said, "and we'll tell them why."
&gt;
&gt;"Do the people of Missouri think they need to get Jay's permission
&gt;to get on the Internet and spend $25?" he asked.
&gt;
&gt;Murphy signed the default order following unopposed testimony
&gt;Thursday in Kansas City from assistant Missouri attorneys general.
&gt;Hirsch said he chose not to appear.
&gt;
&gt;Assistant Attorney General J. Dale Youngs called witnesses,
&gt;presented evidence and drove home his points for four hours.
&gt;Highlights of the hearing included:
&gt;
&gt;- On Feb. 25 an investigator called the web site and a woman named
&gt;Marjorie assured him gambling would be legal. On March 17 he got a
&gt;user ID number and the password "Daisy." He mailed in $100 to play
&gt;in a slots tournament. Nixon soon filed against Interactive Gaming.
&gt;
&gt;- On April 24, Interactive Gaming agreed not to accept business from
&gt;Missouri residents and to put a warning to them on its home site.
&gt;
&gt;- From May 9 to 20 another undercover investigator registered to
&gt;gamble, mailed in $200 to start an account and gambled. That was
&gt;unintentional, Hirsch said Friday,"stupidity by employees."
&gt;
&gt;- Missouri strictly controls gambling and checks backgrounds of all
&gt;companies that apply for licenses. The FBI had served a search
&gt;warrant at Interactive Gaming headquarters in February. The company
&gt;does not know the reason for the search and no charges have been
&gt;filed, Hirsch said Friday.
&gt;
&gt;- All the income from Interactive Gaming comes from gambling
&gt;accounts that clients deposit in Grenada. If customers decided to
&gt;suddenly withdraw all that money, the company would be more than $1
&gt;million short.
&gt;
&gt;Hirsch said Friday that Interactive Gaming's only gambling accounts
&gt;in Missouri came from the two investigators. He hopes for more later,
&gt;he said, when courts establish that citizens or federal laws control
&gt;Internet gambling.
&gt;
&gt;"They say they're not under Missouri law," Nixon said, "but that
&gt;hasn't prevented them from taking Missourians' money."
