Introduction

(Skip down to "Chained Stego" if this intro is obvious for you)

Some users are in countries where crypto is illegal, and would still
like the ability to communicate with others on topics which are
considered illegal in their countries (an example being documenting
civil rights abuses).

For them using encryption is not an option unless they combine with
steganography.

Also in countries where using crypto is legal, people still would like
to have the ability to discuss topics which are considered illegal in
their country (an example exporting cryptographic code, perhaps)

For these users they do have the option of using encryption.  However
for some serious users of crypto, they may wish to hide the fact that
they are sending encrypted communications to anyone at all, as well as
hiding _who_ they are communicating with via mixmaster remailers, and
hiding the contents of their communications via the use of encryption.
Using remailers and using encryption shows up under traffic analysis
even in freer countries, and if you were using steganography, you
would be above suspicion, apparently never having sent an encrypted
message at all, or at least not having sent one during the time in
question.

A useful capability to address the needs of these classes of users
would be to be able to send messages to a remailer by
steganographically encoding them in publically published material,
Examples being: messages posted to USENET, messages posted to mailing
lists, material made available on web pages (text, images, audio
files), CUSeeMe video streams, etc.

Such a system would allow a person in a country where crypto is
outlawed to participate anonymously in discussions in the remaining
free parts of the world without appearing to be using cryptography.

The simple approach is to set up stego to remailer gateways which scan
newsgroups and mailing lists.  (It might be a useful to integrate this
function into the Eternity server, as it is already doing quite a bit
of scanning of newsgroups, and scanning newsgroups is relatively
expensive, so we may as well scan for multiple message types while we
are scanning).

So, to send an anonymous message, a person PGP encrypts their message,
and manipulates the encrypted message to remove the statistical
properties identifying it as a PGP message (by removing
"-----BEGIN..." headers, the fixed PGP formatting inside that, and the
bias caused by the use of RSA), PGP stealth version 2.x would be
suitable for this purpose.

Next a suitable steganographic encoding is required.  A simple method
would be perhaps an in-your-face approach, to include a randomly
distributed, randomly changing .sig:

The stego remailer gateway has to be able to put back together the
multiple parts in the correct sequence.  The Date: field from the post
would be enough information to allow this.


Chained Stego

However there is another problem: the remailer gateway knows the
identity of the stego users.  The stego users therefore have to trust
the stego gateway not to tell the authorities in their country.  They
also have to trust that the gateway is not actually be run by their
own countries censorship board.  The price for misplacing trust and
revealing your use of encryption may be death in some of these
countries.

It would be nice if we could chain the stego function, so that the
amount of trust required of each element could be reduced, in a
similar way to chaining through remailers acheives this.

So (here we get to the actual content of this post, the above having
been introduction), we could arrange that the stego user encrypts with
a selection of stego gateways public keys.  The steps to send to
gateways A and then B are:

1. encrypt with B's public key, normalise output (with pgp stealth)
2. encrypt with A's public key, normalise output
3. encode normalised output from 2 into an innocuous looking USENET post

The process by which the stego message is recovered is then more
complex, and has higher overhead.  Each stego gateway has to scan
newsgroups for stego messages, and forward it's potential partially
decrypted stego messages to the other stego gateways.  Then each of
those remailers decrypts, and if the result is more stego noise, again
forward back to the other stego gateways.  The problem here is when do
we stop!  Remember if we pick a message, and apply our stego decoding
method to it we get something which looks indistinguishable to a stego
message whether there exists a stego message or not.

Also how much of USENET do we scan?  The stego gateways will be
sending a lot of partially decrypted potential stego messages between
themselves.

One potential solution to the infinite loop problem is to include with
the message a note to the gateway stating how many times this has been
decrypted.  After a few hops it can be discarded.  If the max hops is
2, and there are 3 gateways A, B and C.  The messages created by the
single encrypted message are:

round 1: A, B, and C decrypt and forward to each other

round 2: B, and C decrypt

     C discards the output; 
     B forwards the message to the requested remailer

(We presume that multiply encoding to the same remailer is not useful,
if A can decode by denormalising and decrypting twice, you may just as
well have addressed it to A normalised and encrypted once).  

B does not know which person's USENET post this came from.  He does
not know where it is going (to another USENET group via a chain of
remailers, or to an indivdual)

However B does know that remailer A knows who the message is from.

Presume there are n remailers.  For hops which go through h remailers,
collusion is required by all h remailers to obtain the identity of the
poster.  If the attacker owns k of those remailers, that is k of the
remailers are colluding to discover the identity of the stego user,
then the if k &lt; h the attacker will never discover the identity of any
posters using chains of length h.

If k &gt;= h the attacker will discover the identity of a stego user only
in cases where the chain includes all of the hops. (C(n,k) is choose k
of n function computed with n!/((n-k)!k!)

			k!(n-h)!
Prob = C(k,h)/C(n,h) =  --------
			n!(k-h)!

Some sample values, n = 8 values of h = hops, and k = no of rogue
gateways

h= \k|
hops\|   1   2   3   4   5   6  7
---------------------------------
  1  | .13 .25 .38 .50 .63 .75 .88 
  2  | .00 .04 .11 .21 .36 .54 .75 
  3  | .00 .00 .02 .07 .18 .36 .63 
  4  | .00 .00 .00 .01 .07 .21 .50 
  5  | .00 .00 .00 .00 .02 .11 .38 
  6  | .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 .04 .25 
  7  | .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 .00 .13 

Now interestingly it seems to me that this figure is per stego
message, so if you chose different gateway chains on each message your
cumulative chance of being caught would be worse than if you just
chose a chain and stuck to it.

You're trying to minimise your cumulative chance of being identified.
If you use a chain, and the jack boots don't kick down your door for a
few weeks, you hope it is a good chain.

Of course there is a chance that gateways could be taken over and your
chain would then become a compromised chain.  

An additional danger if a gateway is compromised and it's key is
revealed, the attacker can then go back through it's saved messages
and look for messages which came from the newly acquired gateway, or
went to it, to see how many more chains this compromises.  It would
seem like a good idea for the gateways to ensure forward secrecy by
re-keying reasonably frequently.

To do better than this, we could make the stego gateways to act like
middlemen remailers.  That is a gateway will always communicate with
other gateways via a remailer.  Now gateway B does not know which of
gateways A or C decoded the message from the newsgroup.  So he has to
attack them all.

Better still, the gateways can be completely hidden.  They can use a
message pool to communicate.  This has higher overhead, but now the
fact that gateway B knows either A or C decoded the message does not
help much because gateway B can't physically locate A and C.

An alternative to the suggestion of including a count of the number of
decryptions that have taken place so far to avoid infinite loops, is
to do the job probablistically.

Say that each remailer says that it will only accept mesages where the
low order 3 bits after decryption are "101".  This rule doesn't apply
to the first hop, which knows that the message hasn't circulated
anyway, as it has just pulled it from the newsgroup.  So the first
gateway decodes, forwards to the other gateways.  Each gateway
decodes, and if the desired bit pattern comes out, sends the decrypted
message to the other remailers.

This way we place no restriction on the number of hops, avoid
revealing who the first hop is explicitly, but ensure that the
messages which are not stego at all die naturally, and don't propogate
for ever between the gateways.

Also the "101" is likely enough to come up quite by chance, and the
number of actual stego messages is small compared to just ordinary
USENET posts that seeing a "101" doesn't prove anything conclusive
after 1 hop.  However after several hops (if an attacker owns several
of the gateways), the probability of getting multiple "101"s in a row
points increasingly to a stego message, whereas if we relied on a
header stating how many hops, no information would be leaked by the
attacker handling multiple hops in the middle of the chain.

So it's a trade off between lower overall overhead whilst allowing
multiple hops, whilst increasing the susceptability of the system to
leaked information to an attacker who owns multiple rogue gateways.

However these are all very high overhead because they have DC net like
overheads, you send a copy to everything to everyone always, so you
have a perfect mix.

You can trade off this security to obtain lower bandwidth.  Here's one
suggestion of how to do this.  Obviously we can't include with each
partial decryption instructions on who to remail it to (because if you
found some instructions, that would reveal immediately that it was a
stego message).  However, we can interpret the random bit patterns as
remailer instructions.  Say there are n gateways, we can number the
gateways consecutively and take the decrypted message mod n - 1 to
produce the index number of a gateway to send to next.  We can include
a count of decryptions so far to reduce overhead.

Another way to avoid infinite loops with this variation is to take the
decrypted message mod ((n - 1) + j), anything over n-1 gets discarded.
Messages naturally die out statistically at a speed determined by the
ratio of j / n - 1, after h hops there is probability:

	(j / n - 1) ^ h

that the message will get discarded.

Provided the stego users account for a small amount of traffic, their
use would likley be lost in the large pool of noise even if they stuck
to a particular chain.

Or they could themselves use normally distributed selections
of random chains.  However if they did this, their cumulative chance
of sending through only rogue gateways on one post would increase.

Interestingly this setup has different properties to mixmaster mixes,
with this arrangement traffic analysis gives you nothing, as the
inputs are hidden, and the traffic is perfectly normally distributed.
(Presuming that the stego users create random chains also).  Cover
traffic between gateways adds nothing.

You probably need cover traffic on output however, so that the
gateways send constant, or at least evenly distributed amounts of
traffic off into the remailer net, so that one persons posting can not
be correlated with exits from the gateway network.

Some delay in the gateway network would help also.  Random delay is
different to mixing in this instance because there is already lots of
mixing going on, the point is to ensure that an exit from the gateway
network is not observable at fixed time periods after posts from
particular suspected stego users.  If there are many users this should
average out.

Note also, that when a message does decode to a message, the gateway
should generate a random replacement message and forward that to a
random remailer with the same probability as for other non-decoding
messages, otherwise receiving a message would skew the statistics.

Given that the stego user has an interest in sticking to a chain, this
is less secure than sending copies of partially decrypted potential
messages to all gateways.  Either he doesn't stick to his chain, thus
increasing his odds of being detected, or he uses his fixed chain and
runs the risk that this statistic shows through.  If there are many
stego users each with different fixed randonly chosen chains, the fact
that chains are fixed would be less likely to reveal information as
the random chains would tend to cancel out, and themselves have the
same normal distribution as the non-stego traffic.

Comments?

More efficient ways to get around the weakness of a single remailer
gateway hop?
