(I sent this article to cypherpunks@cyberpass.net, but am getting no
traffic from that site, and some of my messages have bounced. I've
subscribed to cypherpunks@algebra.com and will resubmit some of my recent
articles to that address. It would be nice if the "interlinked lists"
system could work to handle outages of sites, and not just mutual
distributions of articles. Any ideas?)

&gt;(Contrary to rumors, I _do) have a live outside of the Net. I've been away
&gt;this weekend. I probably can't, or won't, respond to all of the comments
&gt;about my recent posts.)

&gt;&gt;I would expect a "cypherpunk riot" to be a little more aimed at
&gt;&gt;cyberspace than real-world suburban neighborhoods.  Wouldn't you?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry. I misunderstood you to be speaking of the "fouling of one's own
&gt;nest" (or whatever the ebonics translation might be) riots of recent years.
&gt;
&gt;You are correct that a kind of riot in cyberspace is possible. However, I
&gt;think the attacks (not riots) will not be oriented toward mayhem (no pun
&gt;intended) toward one's neighbors, but towards destablization of
&gt;democracies and military-industrial facilities.
&gt;
&gt;In particular, various attacks against the national labs.
&gt;
&gt;And technologies to make the "force of democracy" lose their teeth.
&gt;
&gt;Subscribe to the Info-War news list for more, although they are
&gt;unfortunately biased toward the U.S. propaganda machine. (It was by some
&gt;of them that I was characterized as an "information terrorist," a label I
&gt;view as an honor.).
&gt;
&gt;(Hint: I was quoted/interviewed in oppostion to the Pentagon's
&gt;"info-warriors" in a BBC television show called "The I-Bomb." My thesis,
&gt;not all of which was inclued in the BBC programme, was that strong crypto
&gt;would and should be used to destablilze U.S. efforts to dominate the New
&gt;World Order. If an I-bomb could destroy the Pentagon, Livermore, Los
&gt;Alamos, and so on, I would press the button tonight. The U.S. military
&gt;machine is vastly more powerful than it needs to be meet the threat of
&gt;invasion of our shores (hint: even Hitler and Tojo were not real threat to
&gt;U.S. shores) and whatever is needed should be done to destabilize and
&gt;sabotage the U.S. industrial war machine.)
&gt;
&gt;The spread of anonymous remailer is already being used to break the back
&gt;of the U.S. war propaganda system. (Given that Lowell Wood's crimes are
&gt;being liberated and sent to non-U.S. sites for their use in defeating the
&gt;war machine).
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks stand for making the United States just another bunch of
&gt;contiguous geographic regions.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
