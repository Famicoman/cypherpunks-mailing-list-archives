Anyone doubting that the center of gravity of world power is shifting
would do well to ponder: 100 of the world's top CEO's are going to 
Bill Gates' house to hear him expound on what the future will look
like.

IF that doesn't make you nervous nothing will.  It's at least as 
nervewracking as anything Clinton admin. might do.

&gt;Sender: owner-misesmail@colossus.net
&gt;Precedence: Bulk
&gt;
&gt;The Executive State:
&gt;The U.S. Presidency vs. American Liberty
&gt;
&gt;	When President Clinton asked golfer Tiger Woods to join him at an official
&gt;propaganda event, and even offered to send Air Force One, Tiger answered as
&gt;every freedom-loving American should: he had something better to do. He was
&gt;going on a vacation with some college chums.
&gt;
&gt;	Tiger has his priorities straight, but his turndown is another indication
&gt;that the presidency is shrinking as an institution. It still commands, but
&gt;no longer compels, our undying (or dying) obedience, no matter how many
&gt;monuments are erected to despots on the Washington Mall. This trend is all
&gt;to the good.
&gt;
&gt;	The legacy of presidential autocracy from the earliest days of the
&gt;republic to the present survives in the form of the executive state. But
&gt;where can you go in the library to find the truth about the havoc U.S.
&gt;presidents have wrecked on the American promise of freedom? Virtually
&gt;nowhere. The official history of the presidency reads like the Lives of the
&gt;Saints.
&gt;
&gt;	The Mises Institute intends to do something about this. In the Fall of
&gt;1998, we're holding a major academic conference on the American presidency.
&gt;Our purpose is to debunk the conventional view that the more power he's
&gt;usurped, the better off the American people are.
&gt;
&gt;	All the presidents qualify for study, but we are especially interested in
&gt;the checkered careers and dictates of Polk, Lincoln, McKinley, Roosevelt I,
&gt;Wilson, Roosevelt II, Truman, Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan.
&gt;
&gt;	If you're a scholar and would like to participate with a paper on some
&gt;aspect of a presidential power grab (or one of those few occasions when a
&gt;president did some good) let us know. An abstract is all that's necessary
&gt;to be considered now.
