&gt; If this society is at war, it is a Civil War, fighting against itself.   In
&gt; fact, there are many groups fighting against each other, on many different
&gt; levels:  racial, gender-based, religious, economic, philosophical, not to
&gt; leave out political.    Companies are fighting each other "tooth &amp; nail"
&gt; for survival in marketing turfs, races are still exchanging vicious barbs,
&gt; homosexuals are under verbal &amp; physical attack by the socially "normed",
&gt; the poor still envy &amp; disparage the rich, women &amp; children seem more than
&gt; ever to be at risk to attacks from roving sex perverts, the liberals would
&gt; love to put the libertarians under, religious groups lecture against the
&gt; moral depravity of all those "other" people, and half the country is either
&gt; stocking up for a National Disaster or forming into militia groups or other
&gt; Think Tanks to fight some sort of government encroachment (even the health
&gt; food stores where I shop are always posting sign-up sheets to vote against
&gt; something or another the government wants to ban or some right-of-choice
&gt; that is being threatened by proposed legislation).

 Second only to Miss Piggy among deep thinkers, Mrs.
Wiggs, the one with the cabbage patch, said this: "In the
mud and scum of things ... Something always always
sings."

  I am grateful that there is at least one female on the list who
is capable of stepping into the middle of the "Dick Wars" on the
list and reminding the men that the "targets" they talk about have 
names, faces, and children.
  I am aware that there is a human cost inherent in every conflict,
and I accept that it will always be so, but I cannot accept the
idea that one can leave their conscience clear by "criminalizing"
their target and discounting their target's humanity.
  I am an anarchist and a realist. If I had a button that would
nuke D.C., I might well push it--but I am also a thinking, feeling
human, and I would cry a river of tears, as well. When I estimate
a "body count", I never fail to count the children.

  Blanc's aim is true when she speaks of the growth of reactionary
posts to the list which fail to include a foundation of creative
thought. 
  Anyone can return fire when attacked and turn the situation into
a firefight where a random volley of ammo decides the outcome of
the battle. However, a good squad leader already has his defences
in place to deal rationally with situations that can easily be
forseen before they arise.
  When "they" come for your neighbor today, will you be surprised
when they come for _you_ tomorrow? When I first heard of Jim Bell's
arrest I began composing a reply to Hallam-Baker's coming post. It
may be vocal and emotionally charged, but it is not done solely
out of blind reactionism.

  God bless Blanc.
