Learn EVERYTHING about your friends, neighbors, enemies,
employees or anyone else! -- even your boss! -- even yourself!

My mammoth SNOOP COLLECTION of internet sites will
provide you...

*  Over 200 giant resources to look up people, credit,
    social security, current or past employment,
    mail order purchases, addresses, phone numbers,
	maps to city locations...
	
	it's incredible...
	
* Track down an old debt, or anyone else that has done
   you wrong!

* Locate an old friend (or an enemy who is hiding)
   or a lost love -- Find e-mail, telephone or address
   information on anyone! Even look up *unlisted* phone
   numbers!

* Investigate your family history!
   Check birth, death, adoption or social security records
   Check service records of Army, Navy, Air Force or
   Marine Corps.

*  Enjoy the enchantment of finding out a juicy tid-bit
   about a co-worker.

*  Check out your daughter's new boyfriend!

*  Find trial transcripts and court orders!

*  Find WORK by searching classified ads ALL OVER THE WORLD!

*  SCREEN prospective employees --
   Check credit, driving or criminal records
   Verify income or educational accomplishments


The Internet is a POWERFUL megasource of information, if you
only know WHERE to look.  I tell you how to find out nearly
ANYTHING about anybody, and tell you exactly where to find it!

You will be amazed to find out what PERSONAL information
other people can find out about YOU! Check your credit report
so you can correct WRONG information that may be used to
deny you credit.

Research YOURSELF first! You'll be horrified, as I was, at
how much data has accumulated about you.

If you believe (like I do) that the information that is
stored about EACH ONE OF US should be freely accessible,
you'll want to see the SNOOP COLLECTION I've compiled.
Verify your own records, or find out what you need
to know about others.

And my huge collection is ONLY THE BEGINNING! Once you locate
these FREE private, college and government web sites, you'll
find even MORE links to even MORE information search engines!

I'm telling you, it's incredible what you can find out using
the internet!
