&gt; &gt;&gt; Every bill that *is not* passed by congress is just that much more freedom
&gt; &gt;&gt; that is saved. If all the bills passed by congress over the past 100yrs.
&gt; &gt;&gt; could all be repealed no one would miss them in the least (well no one
&gt; &gt;&gt; except the STATEST). 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Yeah,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Blacks could go back to being niggers.
&gt; &gt;Women could go back to being barefoot and pregnant
&gt; &gt;etc...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Talk about statest.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know where you get the above from?

Constitutional Amendments are general passed by Congress. Hence, your
statement taken literaly is advocating a great deal of good that has come
from such actions.

&gt; I supose that your statest brainwashing has convinced you that such social
&gt; issues could have only been resolved by Federal intervention. Quite the
&gt; contrary is true. Any laws passed by congress in these areas were brought
&gt; about *because* society was already moving in those directions not the
&gt; other way around.

I was a small boy in the 60's in and around Houston. I remember what
it was like before and after the desegregation that took place in the
mid-60's when I started elementary. I can promise you from personal
experience there were still seperate washrooms and fountains. Sweeney, Tx.
still had a sign on Interstate 90 that said (and I quote) "If you are black
don't let the sun set on you in Sweeney." (the sign was on private property
adjacent to the interstate I found out years later)

As to a little modern social commentary. Ride the city bus in your town for
1 month each day. During that time keep track of where people sit. Would you
like to explain why the majority of blacks still sit in the back of the bus?

And for those who are white with real cajones, walk into a black bar around
1AM on a Sunday.

&gt; If someone is going to descriminate on the basis of race or sex or any
&gt; other criteria they are going to do so reguardless of what laws are passed
&gt; in DC.

Absolutely, as is their Constitutionaly protected right. THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND EVERY OTHER FORM OF SOCIAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT
EVER, PERIOD. Private individuals and companies should, and can,
discriminate to their hearts content. I personaly wouldn't deal with a
business that I knew a priori discriminated against employees or customers
based on sex, religion, etc. as a matter of standard policy. I suspect that
most others with 2 halves of a clue to rub together would refuse as well.
