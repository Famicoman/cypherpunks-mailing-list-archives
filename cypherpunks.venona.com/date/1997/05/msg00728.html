&gt;&gt;&gt; Calling this an "anarchy" is comparable to calling the pogrom by the Third

&gt;&gt; Nonsense.
&gt; 
&gt; No, there is a distinct and marked difference between the absence of 
&gt; government and the presence of lots of different governments, the reason 
&gt; for war in Rwanda is because there are a number of rival factions all 
&gt; competing to gain power, a true anarchy has no government whatsoever.
&gt; Rwanda is an example of undecided government, not no government.

Roving bands of thugs are not the same as an "undecided government".

&gt;&gt; "anarchy n. the absence of government or control, resulting in 
&gt;&gt; lawlessness. 2. disorder, confusion" -- Oxford American Dictionary
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Which part of that would you say didn't apply to Rwanda?  
&gt; 
&gt; The entire first definition, there is no absense of government in Rwanda, 
&gt; merely a number of different prospective government.

Your sentence is an oxymoron, a self contradiction.  A "number of
different prospective governments" are *not* the same as "a
government".  Claiming to be a government is not the same as being a
government. 

&gt; Also, the definition of anarchy is flawed in that it suggests that the 
&gt; word refers to the lack of government leading to lawlessness, my 
&gt; definition, and I would imagine the definition of most members of this 
&gt; list, is that anarchy is the absense of government period. Just because 
&gt; the law we refer to doesn`t suit you does not mean it is not a valid system.

You are free to use the word anarchy to refer to asparagus if you 
wish.  However, the meaning I used is *the* common English meaning.  

&gt; &gt; In fact, the correlation between anarchy and war is very strong, for
&gt; &gt; obvious reasons.  Perhaps that is why most intelligent people don't
&gt; &gt; consider anarchy a desirable state of affairs. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cite?

Cite what? The obvious correlation that you agree to below? Or do you
think I need to do find a study that shows that intelligent people
don't consider an anarchical situation such as the Rwandan collapse a
desirable situation?

&gt; The correlation between your definition of anarchy and war is obvious, if 
&gt; you define anarchy as "A lack of government leading to lawlessness" you 
&gt; are obviously going to see a correlation between this and lawlessness!

That's not *my* definition, it's *the* definition, as described in a
standard, reputable dictionary.  I realize that you have your own
private definition of the term, that you share with your friends and
an esoteric community.  However, I am not a member of that community, 
so I use the standard meaning.

&gt; I could counter argue that the correlation between government and war is 
&gt; irrefutably stronger but then I would be playing your little game, and I 
&gt; don`t want to get drawn into that.

Of course there is a correlation between government and war.  There is
a correlation between people and war, between use of guns and war (so
clearly we could eliminate war by eliminating guns), economics and
war, etc etc.  Correlation is not causation. 

&gt; Your comment that most intelligent people consider that anarchy is not a 
&gt; desirable state of affairs does not even deserve comment, democratic 
&gt; arguments for or against anarchy are completely irrelevant and futile.

Gosh, I thought you weren't going to comment...

Of course, democratic arguments for or against dictatorship are 
completely irrelevant and futile, as well.  Just out of curiosity, 
what the heck is a "democratic argument", anyway?
