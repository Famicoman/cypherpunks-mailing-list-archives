Vladimir Z. Nuri, who is wasting our tax dollars,
if he is paid government stooge, and wasting his
own time, if he is not, wrote:

&gt; I generally agree that our democratic system has degenerated over
&gt; the decades, to the point of being scary and dangerous in places.

  And, in spite of this, you're going to suggest more of the 
"same old, same old" right?
 
&gt; however, we can ask, why did it get to that point? I believe
&gt; it is a failure of the citizens to maintain the
&gt; authority over their congressmen and president.

  And every fairy tale has to include the words,
 
&gt; once upon a time, citizens saw congress and the president as their
&gt; servants. it led to a particular kind of ideology reflected in the
&gt; policies of the country.
&gt; 
&gt; over time, people gradually gave away this authority. they saw the
&gt; president and congress as having authority over citizens, instead of
&gt; vice versa.

  A lot of people give away their televisions to burglars, and their
wallets to armed robbers.
  The person with the largest weapon has the most authority.
 
&gt; TCM's idea of telling congress and the president to f*** off is actually,
&gt; in my opinion, an extreme case of people giving away their authority.
&gt; it is more of the same problem, not the solution. it is failing to
&gt; address the root of the problem-- that the president and congress
&gt; must be put in a subservient relationship to the desires of the citizens.

  So you're about to suggest following Tim McVeigh's example, only
at the White House, instead, right?

&gt; one must uncreate the monster in the same ways it was created.

  Right. It began life at the point of a gun, and that's the way it
should end when the monster begans feeding on those who created it.
 
&gt; I commend CDT and all other online groups for their organizational
&gt; motives and drive, and condemn TCM for his pissing on them. what is he doing?

  Sounds like a good, old-fashioned cypherpunks pissing contest
to me. Better lay in extra beer.

&gt; if something is broken, do you fix it, or abandon it? or shoot it? TCM is
&gt; always advocating the latter two. it's not a solution, and he knows it,
&gt; and everyone else here knows it too.

  This is wonderful! At last the cypherpunks have a leader who can 
speak for all of us.
  When does the New List Moderation begin? I'm going to have to lay
in a whole shitload of beer for this round.
