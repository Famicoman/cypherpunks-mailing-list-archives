&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A ban on all handguns even when registered (currently all pistols above 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .22 are banned and all guns have to be registered in a process whereby if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the applicant for a certificate has any history of political dissention 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or crime (eg. Smoking a joint, the ultimate sin against society) the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certificate will be refused.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What would be an example of such political dissention?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I`m pretty sure that, having recently been involved in campaigns 
&gt; against the ban on handguns, written to a number of people in positions 
&gt; of power over the proposed TTP scheme in the DTI white paper etc. my 
&gt; firearms licence will not be renewed the next time it comes up for review.
&gt; The powers that be now presumably see me as a loon.
&gt; 
&gt; A damning enditement on the British people is that last time I mentioned 
&gt; to someone my having written to the home office and others over the 
&gt; proposed gun ban I was called a lunatic and told "The sort of person who 
&gt; writes to the home office over something like that is the least suitable 
&gt; to have a gun".
&gt; 
&gt; I can assure you this is not a one-off, this happens every time people who 
&gt; don`t shoot find out I do. They have been brainwashed by the 
&gt; tabloid press, for example, the daily mail ran a particularly vitriolic 
&gt; hate campaign against gun owners singling out Albie Fox, leader of the 
&gt; campaign against the ban, and calling him a "Gun obsessed lunatic".
&gt; This, recall, is the same daily mail which rants every day about the 
&gt; "evil of drugs" and how the only way to "save society" is to throw 
&gt; everyone who doesn`t support their particular brand of bigoted fanaticism 
&gt; into jail for the rest of their life.
&gt; 
&gt; And of course, one would imagine that those who actually owned guns and 
&gt; used them for sport themselves would be the most informed people who 
&gt; would realise that the criminal use of guns is at the opposite end of the 
&gt; scale to the sporting use allowed in British law. However, I know several 
&gt; people who have said "I`m happy to give up my guns if it will save 
&gt; lives", to this I simply reply "who were you going to kill?" then walk 
&gt; away, these people don`t even deserve correcting as their bullshit is so 
&gt; deep.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, when the police revoke or refuse to renew a firearms 
&gt; certificate, they do not need to give a reason, so one cannot even prove 
&gt; that it was because of speech or opinions they didn`t like that they 
&gt; revoked the certificate. Even if you could, it is unlikely a challenge in 
&gt; court would succeed, the UK does not have the same free speech guarantees 
&gt; as are given in the US and elsewhere, and any court challenge would fail, 
&gt; of that I am sure.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, to worsen the situation, the labour party has now come to power and 
&gt; as I have already explained in a previous post this make matters even worse.
&gt;
