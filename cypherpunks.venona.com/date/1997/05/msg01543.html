Speaking of unwanted messages, which legislators call "spamming."

An EFF person, whom I do respect, by the way, added my name to a spammer's
list, some shtick they have called "sixdegrees."

Here's the spam I just got, complete with what they claim is my "password."
Inasmuch as I never requested this password, and have no intention of using
it, and have no contractual relationship with either "sixdegrees" or
Stanton McCandlish, you folks might want to have some fun with this alleged
service and (unrequested) password. The password may only work if it comes
from "tcmay@mail.got.net," but, then, I hear that such "From:" fields are
easily spoofed.

&gt;
&gt;You've been listed by Stanton McCandlish as "Acquaintance"
&gt;as part of a free Internet networking service called sixdegrees(tm).
&gt;
&gt;WHAT WE ARE:
&gt;
&gt;   sixdegrees is a Web site at <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com/">http://www.sixdegrees.com/</A> that's
&gt;   based on the theory that everyone on earth is connected to
&gt;   everyone else through a path of six people or less. We hope to
&gt;   use the power of the Internet to revolutionize the way people
&gt;   network.
&gt;
&gt;WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU:
&gt;
&gt;   You can come to <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com/">http://www.sixdegrees.com/</A> and use our FREE
&gt;   services to network with the people you want to know through
&gt;   the people you do know. You can find out how you're connected
&gt;   to specific people, like that person who's interviewing you for
&gt;   a new job next week. Or, you can find out how you're connected
&gt;   to certain kinds of people, like pediatricians in San Francisco,
&gt;   or inline skaters in New York.
&gt;
&gt;WHAT'S IN IT FOR US:
&gt;
&gt;   We make money by selling ads on the sixdegrees site. We
&gt;   never sell lists of names or any specific information about
&gt;   our individual members to anybody. To find out more about
&gt;   our policies regarding privacy, just visit
&gt;   <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com/about/privacy.cfm">http://www.sixdegrees.com/about/privacy.cfm</A>
&gt;
&gt;HOW IT WORKS:
&gt;
&gt;   If you list your contacts and how you know them, we'll forward
&gt;   them an email like this one. They'll be invited to confirm their
&gt;   relationship to you and to participate in sixdegrees themselves
&gt;   by listing their contacts.
&gt;
&gt;WHAT TO DO NEXT:
&gt;
&gt;   Just reply to this e-mail by following the INSTRUCTIONS below
&gt;   (you may want to print it out first - it's easier that way.)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   And remember to visit <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com/">http://www.sixdegrees.com/</A>. Click on Services,
&gt;   log-in with your password, which is cusproll, and enjoy
&gt;   networking on a whole new level.

&gt;   number are separated by SEMI-COLONS.
