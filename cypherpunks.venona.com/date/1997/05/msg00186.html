&gt; &gt; In a recent announcement, Netscape Communications announced plans to
&gt; &gt; include government back doors in their products. "By implementing this
&gt; &gt; so-called 'key recovery', Netscape is getting a small increase in key
&gt; &gt; length in exchange for putting your keys in the hands of the
&gt; &gt; government," said Parekh. "This the same government that hired Aldrich
&gt; &gt; Ames, the same goverment that has IRS employees surfing taxpayer
&gt; &gt; databases at will. What do you think is going to happen to your keys?"
&gt; 
&gt; This is utter crap, and I'm sure you know it.  All we're going to do is
&gt; provide an OPTIONAL (and I mean really optional, not the way the feds
&gt; use it) way for administrators to recover private keys.  This is not
&gt; GAK.  I will never work on a product that includes GAK.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, but I guess saying that Netscape is responding to customer
&gt; requirements by including support for corporate key recovery wouldn't
&gt; make such good press release spam.

  Crap seems to be such a violent, obscene word when used to 
describe C2Nut's bullshit. Good thing that the cryptography list
has Perry to protect the list subscribers from StrangleHold's
competition defending themselves from Sameer's self-serving
denigration of their products.

  Too bad C2Nut doesn't have a StrangleHold on the cypherpunks
list, as well. Then they could use censorship threats to make
us all be good little boys and girls, too. 
  I expect all PR statements to have a modicum of bullshit in
them and I resent any lame-fuck-would-be-Hitler trying to put
a lid on the response to that bullshit.

  The fact that StrangleHold seems to have so many things to
hide and such a strong need to control discussion of its product
indicates to me that perhaps their product cannot stand up to
the light of public scrutiny and criticsm.
  C2Nut's bottle-fed cryptography list may be fine for those who
are afraid to know too much about StrangleHold, but anyone who
owns a wetsuit needs to subscribe to the cypherpunks list for 
the good, old-fashioned pissing contests that send the pretenders
home with their tails between their legs.
  (Anyone hear from DataERetch lately?)
