  Declaration of Digital Independence
 -------------------------------------

We, the computer-literate and technologically superior, in order to
break the ignorant chains of those who hold us back, do hereby
declare our freedom from those who control what they do not
understand. We wish to no longer hear the cries of
"pornography-superhighway" and "cyber-patrol". We reject the
repulsive nonsense shoved down our throats by all forms of media
telling of the dangers of piracy, pornography, and in general, free
thought. There are no "cyber-molesters" we cannot stop as a people.
If you educate your children like the good parent you should be,
they should know what is right and what is wrong, and will be wise,
young judges, with free thought and judgement. We cannot simply
"block" what we find offensive, on the net, on bulletin boards, and
as we all know, in real life. We must learn to deal with the "day to
day inadequacies" of life, and we must not simply become mindless
drones of those that fight to restrict freedom. We must fight even
harder than they, and we must fight to stay free, or all right is
lost. If it's not worth fighting for, then you have already been
brainwashed.

The internet (NOT info-superhighway, or i-way, as those terms are
simply insulting and degrading, made up by the ignorant) cannot and
SHOULD NOT be regulated. It should be allowed to make it's own rules.
It is bigger than any world you can and can't imagine, and it will
not be controlled. It is the embodiment of all that is free; free
information, friendship, alliances, materials, ideas, suggestions,
news, and more. The "Cyber-Angels" are only well-meaning do-gooders
with nothing better to do than to "tattle" on those with different
ideas than they. They use entrapment, and have twisted their ideas
and values to make them apply to cyberspace, trying to rule an area
they do not understand. Fighting for the freedom to think is good,
but to fight for an idea you believe is the only true idea is itself
ignorance. The nazis believed that they were superior, in ideas and
actions, and the "Cyber Angels" are nothing more. You cannot stop
freedom of thought, and they try anyway, to convert anyone and
everyone to their mode of thought. But those of us who see clearly
know that the internet is the greatest invention ever, topping the
telephone and electricity. It is a gathering of the mental body of
billions of people, and we will not be stopped.

The media, as it is known, is the propaganda vending machine of
today. As a whole, they trip over themselves, feeding lies to the
ignorant, and we who are not will watch too, to laugh at the
stupidity that is the media. We sit in front of our televisions, or
listening to the radio, or looking at a newspaper or a magazine, and
we laugh. We laugh and laugh, because the media has become a
ridiculous pool of lies and half-truths. They say we're more
dangerous than sicknesses, and nuclear weapons, because we choose to
laugh at their ideas and boundaries, and we fight to expand them. We
laugh at the pitiful security devices used to keep knowledge from
spreading, and we rip down the beaurocratic bullshit tape they put up
in virtual doorways. We call the boards they show on the news,
covered in ideas and values different than theirs, and we like it. We
like asking for a computer program that we never would have bought,
and having it show up in our mailboxes. We like leaving messages on
BBS' containing information on how to blow up a building or how to
kill a man with your bare hands. We like it, not because it scares
people or because it's "twisted" or "evil", but because it's
forbidden, and lost. You do not know what a "redbox" is? Come,
friend, and I will spread the lost knowledge. And when I tell you,
you will tell another, and we will be held together by the knowledge
which we "should not know". We are the illuminati, and the
enlightened. We look not to the old sciences of textbook learning,
but to the primitive ways, of communication and experience.

We are sickened by the unenlightened. We despise those who wish not
to learn, and those who read the same books, over and over again,
under different names, believing that they are learning. We are the
"different", and the "abnormal", those who are sometimes disliked
because we regurgitate the lies fed to us by the governing. Everyone
has the need to know, the curiosity of the caveman who invented
fire, but some have been trained like monkeys, not ever knowing it's
there. They simply accept things, and do what is expected of them,
and this is sad. They are those who never fight back, and never open
their minds. And they are, unfortunately, usually the governing
bodies; the teachers, bosses, police, federal agents, congressmen,
senators, parents, and more. And this, my friend, must change.

We will not be "voted out", and we will not be mentally disfigured.
If they had the chance, government and the media would give everyone
a virtual labotamy. Our minds to be held in chains, forced to take in
what is given. This is unacceptable. We will not be held down, by
the ignorant, the foolish, and especially the lazy. We take your
textbooks and your lies, and we put them back in the dusty
storerooms where they belong. And we share ideas, and make new ones,
and sometimes ask for a hand to hold, and not one around our throat.
We see what no others can, and what no others want to see. It is a
technological revolution, and a revolution of ideas. We will fight
in battles for our freedom to think, should there be any, but we will
not start any. We are not a violent group, but our opposition
believes ideas should not be let loose to grow, and they will begin
the battle. They have no honor, stealing from us our rights, our
liberty, and our freedom of thought. And for this, we label them
unforgiven...


- Anarchy, and the AoC...
