Nothing wrong in being superstitious...

 &gt; &gt; READ THIS MESSAGE AND PASS IT ON....
 &gt; &gt; A man takes the day off work and decides to go out golfing.  He is
 &gt; &gt; on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the green.
 &gt; &gt; He  thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears,
 &gt; &gt; "Ribbit. 9 Iron"  The man looks around and doesn't see anyone.
 &gt; &gt; "Ribbit. 9 Iron." He looks at  the frog and decides to prove the
 &gt; &gt; frog wrong, puts his other club away, and  grabs a 9 iron. Boom! he
 &gt; &gt; hits it 10 inches from the cup. He is shocked. He  says to the frog,
 &gt; &gt; "Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?" The frog reply's
 &gt; &gt; "Ribbit. Lucky frog." The man decides  to take the frog with him to
 &gt; &gt; the next hole. "What do you think frog?" the  man asks. "Ribbit. 3
 &gt; &gt; wood."  The guy takes out a 3 wood and Boom! Hole in one. The man is
 &gt; &gt; befuddled and doesn't know what to say. By the end of the day, the
 &gt; &gt; man golfed the best game of golf in his life and asks the frog,"OK
 &gt; &gt; where to next?" The frog replied, "Ribbit. Las Vegas." They go to
 &gt; &gt; Las Vegas and the guy says, "OK frog, now what?"  The frog says,
 &gt; &gt; "Ribbit Roulette." Upon approaching the roulette table, the man
 &gt; &gt; asks," What do you think I should bet?" The frog replies, "Ribbit.
 &gt; &gt; $3000,black 6." Now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after
 &gt; &gt; the golf game, the man figures what the heck. Boom! Tons of cash
 &gt; &gt; comes sliding back across the table. The man takes his winnings and
 &gt; &gt; buys the best room in the hotel.  He sits the frog down and says,
 &gt; &gt; "Frog, I don't know how to repay you.  You've won me all this  money
 &gt; &gt; and I am forever grateful." The frog replies, "Ribbit, Kiss Me." He
 &gt; &gt; figures why not, since after all the frog did for him he deserves
 &gt; &gt; it. With a  kiss, the frog turns into a gorgeous 14-year-old girl.
 &gt; &gt; "And that, your honor, is how the girl ended up in my room."
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; The origination of this letter is unknown, but it  brings good
 &gt; &gt; luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the chain
 &gt; &gt; will have bad luck.  Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
 &gt; &gt; Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.
 &gt; &gt; You will see that something good happens to you four days from now
 &gt; &gt; if the chain is not broken.  You will receive good luck in four
 &gt; &gt; days.
