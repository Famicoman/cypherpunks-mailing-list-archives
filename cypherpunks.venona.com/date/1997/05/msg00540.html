(I sent this article to cypherpunks@cyberpass.net, but am getting no
traffic from that site, and some of my messages have bounced. I've
subscribed to cypherpunks@algebra.com and will resubmit some of my recent
articles to that address. It would be nice if the "interlinked lists"
system could work to handle outages of sites, and not just mutual
distributions of articles. Any ideas?)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would expect a "cypherpunk riot" to be a little more aimed at

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Tim was mostly talking about nuking the District of Columbia.  You will
&gt;&gt;note that that is an artificial community filled entirely with politicians
&gt;&gt;and their sycophants.  It is sort of like the train that Ayn has blow up
&gt;&gt;in the Rocky Mountain tunnel in Atlas Shrugged.  There are no innocents
&gt;&gt;there. (Well a few tourists and Ethiopian immigrants who don't know better
&gt;&gt;but you can't win 'em all.)  Note also that he is hoping others will do
&gt;&gt;the deed.  He's not volunteering.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;There will be a few unfortunate explosions in the world over the next few
&gt;&gt;years so I'm sure Tim is just hoping for a beneficial target selection.
&gt;
&gt;Indeed. Beneficial target selection. Though I think it much more likely
&gt;that the U.S.-recognized capital of the Zionist entity will be a more
&gt;likely target to undergo nuclear cleansing. (And even there some innocent
&gt;civilians, both Muslim and Jew, will surely be hastened to their meetings
&gt;with Allah, He Whose Name May Not be Expressed (YHWH), or the Great Honey
&gt;Bear. No accounting for wanting to live in near Ground Zero...religion is
&gt;a strange thing.)
&gt;
&gt;What I think a careful perusal of my comments about D.C. will reveal is
&gt;that I will not cry for its destruction, and would, all in all, smile a
&gt;broad grin if I wake up some morning to hear on CNN that D.C. is no more.
&gt;It's a free country, so I can express such happy thoughts about such
&gt;corruptions being cleansed.
&gt;
&gt;(As for crypto and Cypherpunks, anyone who is honest must admit that
&gt;strong crypto and Cypherpunks are helping to make this a more plausible
&gt;scenario. The bullshit that strong crypto is only for "democratic forces"
&gt;is too naive to even comment on. Strong crypto is to give a handful of
&gt;people the power to undermine statist authorities and imperial capitals.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
