I think I'd like to have some voice in who steps up to the bar
to fill the power vacuum, though, after the rapid oxidation 
within the Beltway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You might remember I wrote recently about the DoJ report released this
&gt;&gt;&gt;month that calls for new legislation to ban bomb-making info online. Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;Feinstein's office tells me she's going to introduce a bill.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Feinswine never saw a gun/mind control bill she didn't like. She is an
&gt;&gt;ultra fascist that rose to power thanks to the yellow dog Bay Area voters.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Feinswine/Swinestein is the most despicable of all the politicians in
&gt;Congress. (This is not just ideology speaking...her usual-ally Barbara
&gt;Boxer is much less swinish, and even has some independent thoughts. I can't
&gt;see I often agree with Boxer, but she's not the Big Sister automaton that
&gt;Swinestein is.)
&gt;
&gt;We're basically under assault from all directions. The bozos in Congress
&gt;and state governments are spinning out new laws and obscure regulations
&gt;faster than we can react...and of course they're using our money to
&gt;generate these laws and lobby for them. Further, a mostly-brainwashed
&gt;Washington media population is surprising uncritical of these blizzard
&gt;drifts of new laws.
&gt;
&gt;As others have noted, recently James Donald, the lawmakers play the "good
&gt;cop, bad cop" game very well. Crypto becomes exportable (good cop), but
&gt;only if keys are given to the government (bad cop). Speech is ostensibly
&gt;protected by new laws, but new provisions criminalize racist, homophobic,
&gt;disrespectful, hurtful, offensive, or unpopular opinions.
&gt;
&gt;The "there ought to be a law" crowd is in high gear.
&gt;
&gt;The only proper rebuttal is to reject their view that more laws will fix
&gt;the societal ills they perceive.
&gt;
&gt;Attempting to "work with them" only feeds the good cop/bad cop system, as
&gt;the SAFE and Pro-CODE bills show.
&gt;
&gt;Removing the Washington area as a malignant tumor requiring drastic surgery
&gt;remains an option.
&gt;
&gt;--Tim May
&gt;
&gt;There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
&gt;Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
