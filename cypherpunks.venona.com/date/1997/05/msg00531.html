Below, from the cypherpunks archives:
-------------------
  As MediaFilter reported:

The March edition of Taking Aim, the newsletter of the Militia of

Montana, issued a call to arms for April 19, the day of the Oklahoma
blast: 



Federal prosecutors in (Richard Snell's) the '88 trial claimed that 
the '83 plot_which included counterfeiting, armed robberies and plans 
to assassinate federal judges and the Arkansas FBI chief_was to begin
with the detonation of a truck bomb at the Oklahoma City Federal 
Building. 

All of the defendants were acquitted. But that very same building 
would be blown up by a truck bomb on the very day of Richard Snell's 
execution.



Snell died knowing of the explosion. 

His last words were a warning to Arkansas Governor Guy Tucker: 
"Look over your shoulder, justice is on the way..." 



TruthBomber
-----------------------

  Planning the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building has long
been as standard an exercise for paramilitarists as typing "The quick
brown fox..." has been for typists. The trial mentioned above is not
the only one in which the targeting of the OKC Federal Building was 
involved as a goal of paramilitary objectives.
  To think that federal security personnel in Oklahoma City were 
unaware of this is ludicrous. The fact that they allowed a daycare
to be placed there (or perhaps initiated the action) is as criminal 
an act as the bombing itself.
  Naturally, there will be no trial or investigation of government
criminality in this regard, but only of the actions of anti-government
criminals.

  Freedom and liberty in the world is not in the hands of the citizens,
but in the hands of those who are concerned about it. (The same as
high-fashion or many other mental constructs.)
  There may not be an overt war taking place between the average
citizen and the government, but there is one taking place between the
government and those who oppose the draconian limitations being placed
on their freedom and liberty under the guise of "rule of law."
