Shabbir,

You're mistaken. I'm not "slighting their work" -- I called it a "solid
improvement."

Yeah, I know who shopped this around. I spoke with David and Don about
this last week, and didn't write about it then for fear of jeopardizing
their negotiations.

And come on, you're "more than a little surprised" by my take? Give me a
break. My position now is consistent with my position before -- and comes
as no surprise. Reread my previous posts. 

But you're missing the point: this whole "crypto in a crime" section
should not be in this bill in the first place. The new portion is much
better than the old, but it still has no business being law.

&gt; &gt;* The heinous section of the law that would create

&gt; &gt;  and adopted unanimously includes eight hurdles:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	"Any person who, in the commission of a felony under
&gt; &gt;	a criminal statute of the United States, knowingly
&gt; &gt;	and willfully encrypts incriminating information
&gt; &gt;	relating to that felony with the intent to conceal
&gt; &gt;	such information for the purposes of avoiding
&gt; &gt;	detection by law enforcement agencies or
&gt; &gt;	prosecution..."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  It's a solid improvement, but this language still has
&gt; &gt;  no business becoming law. Problem is, nobody seems to
&gt; &gt;  have the balls to stand up and yank it. Delahunt,
&gt; &gt;  the amendment's sponsor, said the bill without the
&gt; &gt;  amendment "could have a chilling effect on the
&gt; &gt;  development and use of encryption." He added: "I
&gt; &gt;  recognize that some supporters of this amendment would
&gt; &gt;  like that this section be removed altogether." But it
&gt; &gt;  doesn't seem likely.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm more than a little surprised at your take on this amendment.  This
&gt; exact language wasn't created by Representatives who don't know better, it
&gt; was created, shopped, and marketed to the hill by the folks at the ACLU
&gt; (Don Haines) and EPIC.  In response to concerns from the net, they
&gt; coordinated the letter from many groups to Goodlatte about the criminal
&gt; provision which just about everyone signed onto.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, EPIC and the ACLU worked out the language above, and got it passed
&gt; verbatim in response to the concerns of the net community.  They did a
&gt; great job here and really deserve a lot of kudos.  Why are you slighting
&gt; their work?
&gt;
