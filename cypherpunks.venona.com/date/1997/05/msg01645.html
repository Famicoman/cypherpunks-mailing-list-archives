Dear Friend:

Hi...my name is Britt Phillips. If you suspect infidelity, or know someone
who does . . .please take a couple of minutes to read this.

I am  very excited about the many people from all walks of life who 
have truly benefited from the publications that I have put together.

I have been a fully licensed Private Investigator for almost eleven
years. I currently work within a full caseload. My clients include 
attorney's,insurance companies, physicians as well as those in 
the corporate and private sector. I have very extensive knowledge 
as a direct result of working many different types of cases over 
this period of time. I currently focus my investigative services in 
the areas of insurance fraud and domestic and family issues. 

My background includes an honorable tour in the United States 
Navy as an Operations Specialist in the operational intelligence 
division. In this capacity I held a secret clearance and routinely 
handled very sensitive information vital to national security. In 
addition to these responsibilities I was also a member of an elite 
team who's members gathered intelligence as it relates to other 
countries around the world by photographing weapons and 
electronics systems and by gathering information about them 
useful in strategy. I have served at the Pentagon and have many 
personal memories of service to my country. 

I also have security experience in a major retail company as a 
loss prevention expert. In this capacity I continued my
investigative skills and worked my way up to be placed in charge 
of three locations. It was while in this capacity that I was 
introduced to the investigative field and fell in love with all that it 
has to offer.

I began in the trenches so to speak and worked my way up in a 
major investigative firm. I remained there for 4 years. I was well 
known by the company president as an eager investigator wanting 
to learn every type of case imaginable. I was turned down an offer 
to open a satellite office for this company during its expansion 
phase. I accepted a position with another firm and took over a 
lagging investigative company. I remained there for three years 
and ended my tenure with the title of investigations director!

Some of my past cases include:

Workers' Compensation, Narcotics, Homicide, Missing Persons, 
Adoption Searches, Skip Traces, Domestic &amp; Family Issues,Child 
Custody, Infidelity, Criminal, Civil, Process Service, Witness
Location, Background Checks, Contract Disputes, Asset Checks, 
Theft, Fraud, Personal Injury, Auto Liability, Automobile
Repossession, Hit and Run and many many others.

Our hope is that this has given you a tool from which to measure 
my knowledge and experience. Your comfort level is very 
important to us and it will remain the same way long after you 
purchase publications from our office. We are committed to 
providing YOU with the quality,efficient, honest, reliable service 
that you not only deserve but should demand.

"How to Expose Infidelity" is a publication that I am very
pleased to be a part of. It includes many helpful sections that will 
literally change your life forever. I can say this because most 
people make many mistakes when they are suddenly confronted 
with an infidelity situation. There also is the factor that many don't 
discover the infidelity until after the lawyers have walked away and 
the case is resolved. This can be a major loss to anyone 
especially when children and settlements are concerned. In this 
same light it is very crucial to document infidelity from the earliest 
stages. The early stages when infidelity is first suspected are the 
most crucial to your case. Now you can learn from my many 
years of field experience working these types of cases.

This is a very important time and unfortunately most people allow 
their emotions to rule their intellect and do things that actually 
jeopardize their own case. It's only after these mistakes are 
pointed out that they are aware of them.Yes, that's right you 
guessed it, by then it's way to late! in "How to Expose Infidelity" 
YOU will learn what to do and when to do it. YOU will learn about 
hidden clues that are consistent with those involved in infidelity. 
YOU will learn the all important things to ask your attorney and 
investigator and how to interview each to make sure you are 
getting fair,competent representation. YOU will learn the most 
common mistakes that almost everyone makes and how to avoid 
them! YOU will learn how to channel your emotions and save your 
case instead of unknowingly doing things that compromise you.

But please...don't take my word for it. 

Read for yourself what other current owners have said:

"Your help made the greatest difference in my personal situation. 
I was able to reach a much better settlement and owe many 
thanks to you as well as my attorney. Your information revealed 
facts I previously was not aware of. If your guide had not been 
available, I would have been among the many who make the 
same mistakes on your list! Many thanks for a very helpful tool." 

"I purchased your infidelity guide because I had never gone 
through a divorce. Pride kept me from calling a private 
investigator to discus my situation. After reading your information 
I interviewed two investigator's.The first one was more interested 
in my retainer than my case. I used the techniques learned from 
your guide to quickly dismiss him and retained the second one. 
We won the case!" 

"My attorney commented that often in domestic cases her job 
can be very difficult at times, especially due to the mistakes 
that many clients routinely make. I was so glad that I had read 
your information beforehand.Thank you for being in my corner."

If you or someone you know find themselves in the unfortunate 
situation in which infidelity could very well be a real possibility, 
YOU owe it to yourself to find out the true facts as they are 
happening. As a top private investigator I have helped literally 
hundreds of people restore peace of mind during this trying, 
emotional period in their lives.

"How to E-X-P-O-S-E Infidelity" is an  A-Z guide that walks the 
reader throughout the complete process including:

~ Clues to look for
~ Mistakes that are almost always made by those who 
suspect their spouse of infidelity
~ How to avoid costly common mistakes
~ What to look for when talking to an investigator
~ The interview process and hiring an attorney
~ Complete question and answer session including 
answers to many questions routinely asked over the years.

Take action and restore peace of mind today. You owe it to 
yourself to find out the truth.

The cost of "How to E-X-P-O-S-E Infidelity"  is $19.95. It 
cannot be stressed enough that this price is really insignificant 
when you consider what your losses could be. You have my 
personal guarantee that if you apply what this guide teaches, 
YOU will be very relieved to have had a guide of this nature from 
which to learn from BEFORE, instead of after!
