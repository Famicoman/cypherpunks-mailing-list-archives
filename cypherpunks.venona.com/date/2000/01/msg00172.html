Eldon Warmanis in the klink, arrested without warrant, and on bogus charges.  
THey got him less than an hour after he got out of hospital for major surgery.

The charges are bogus, and among them is "diatribe against government", 
apparently.

I personnally tried to connect to www.detaxcanada.org but was denied access.
The domain name is still registered at Internic, as of today.  A PING to 
detaxcanada.org yields a response, so does a traceroute.

Notwithstanding what the writer below say, I have no confirmation of who shut 
down the site.  Several people are investigating.

Note that it is rumored that Revenue Canada opened thier own "detax" sites to 
trap people.  The detaxcanada.com and .net sites are suspected to be such 
sites.  AS for untaxman.com, I have no idea.

You will not something of utmost interest: Even with the three bogus charges 
against Eldon, they never charged him for evading taxes...  :-)

FREEDOM CANADA NEWSLETTER ISSUE #1

The people created government to serve them and protect their freedom!

What a stroke of luck. The government has decided to destroy another freedom
fighter and try to silence him. They will not win in the end. I believe that
we will eventually have another powerful triumph in our pursuit to retain
our rights as Canadians. Don¹t be disheartened at this turn of events. The
people cannot be kept in the darkness for long. However, remember the saying
that all publicity is good publicity. Let¹s make the most of this publicity
to help spread the word to everyone you know.

Folks, this is a serious issue that I need to pass on to as many people as
possible with your help. Send it out pronto and get the people aware of this
atrocity to our rights and freedoms as Canadians. I have been telling people
that the government knows what Eldon and I teach is lawful and is right.
This makes people like us very dangerous to the government. Well, the
government is striking back against the people it is supposed to serve. I
have just found out that Eldon Warman was forcibly taken from his home
without an arrest warrant and removed to an undisclosed location in iron
shackles! For God's sake, the man is 59 years old and recovering from a
kidney stone operation. The police broke into his home and unlawfully
removed him while threatening the other occupants after Eldon had been home
from surgery at the hospital for a grand total of 90 minutes!

Eldon's site has been shut down! Do you realize this means that your right
to freedom of speech has been shut down. This issue is not about Eldon, it
is about you and your family, folks. If we sit back and do nothing, this
means all our rights are gone. It's game over. The government knows that
people have the right to opt out of the income tax system lawfully. They
can't stop you as an individual from applying it to your situation, but they
sure can stop those who teach it by removing this information from the
public domain. According to the government, you have no property rights, you
have no freedom of speech and you better go back to being a sheep or else.
You have a decision to make. The government is going to try and sweep this
under the rug. Don't let them. Demand answers to this atrocity.

Currently, my website at www.untaxman.com is the only one that is now
available to teach Canadians what their rights are in relation to income
taxes. How much longer will I be up and running before they come for me?
This is how bad it's getting in Canada. I am starting the Freedom Canada
Newsletter immediately and will continue to send it out as new items come
up. We cannot allow the voices to be silenced.

For those who have been hearing bit and pieces of this story, here is the
full scenario below. I want to give you the names of all the MLA¹s that need
to be e-mailed with this and the list is at the end of this newsletter. Ask
them why such a disgusting display of persecution is happening in Canada.
Tell them you will be passing on this e-mail to twenty or more people in the
next few days and this number will multiply exponentially.

The following is from Fred Kyburz, who has also been persecuted in the past
for speaking out. For the full story, go to his web site at
www.telusplanet.net/public/kyburz and go to the Daily Info Page.  He says it
best, so I will give Fred the floor here...

It is interesting to find out who is friend and who is foe. Situations like
Eldon's lend themselves to the separation of friend and foe. One simply has
to keep an open mind and an open ear. One has to listen to the
undercurrents. I am thankful to have the opportunity of being able to select
the true friends from the ones who pose as friends but are also working for
the enemy. The enemy did a good job in hiring an entire army of sleaze bags
and frauds. Later on we will expose these would-be friends. I rather work
with only two or three true friends who can be trusted and depended on than
with an entire army of sleaze bags. And it seems that there is an army of
sleaze bags out there being eager to mess things up for Eldon.

To Eldon's true friends and genuine helpers I say: Thank you. You are
participating in a worthwhile and noble cause. Continue to fan the flame of
freedom. Tyranny will be destroyed eventually. The sleaze bags will be
defeated with the tyranny they support right now. So, take courage and do
not let yourself be hindered by the scum of mankind, the despicable
characters aiding in mankind's destruction for that lousy proverbial silver
dollar. Take courage and do whatever is in your power to help freedom
survive in these difficult times.

DIP for December 31, 1999

Another day has passed. We experienced additional surprises. I called the
Remand Centre to ask when Eldon would be picked up to be transferred to
Revelstoke. It seemed that the Thursday rules (yesterday was Thursday) do
not allow the prison employees to give out any information to anyone. Under
the Wednesday rules my questions were answered. The Crown prosecutor in my
case of two years ago, Mr. Richard Paziuk, has proven to be right many times
since the day he stated in court 'that the law can change from day to day'.
This obviously has happened again in the case of giving out information
regarding a prisoner. Be this as it may, the Just-Us system is very, very
flexible! mostly not in favor of the victim of the legal mafia. Sorry you
lawyers and judges, I have the duty to tell it as it is. I know this does
not please you. Yet you have to get used to listen to the truth.

Eldon called last night to let us know that he is in Vernon, British
Columbia. I asked him how he was being treated. He answered: "like the worst
criminal". He was in iron shackles during the entire flight. A serial killer
is not treated worse than Eldon is being treated. After all, a serial killer
is aiding the "Minions of Luciferian Assassins" in the 'elimination' of the
two billion people - one by one whereas Eldon is putting the brakes on the
advance of totalitarian rule. Eldon is a REAL threat to the system. He is
therefore a deadly enemy to their plans. Of course he is dangerous. Of
course he has to be guarded very carefully. If the guards only understood
that they are aiding in their own destruction. If these guards and the
police only understood that they will be treated just the same as they treat
right now people like Eldon as soon as the NWO is secured and firmly
established. They most likely will be treated worse, they will get the
bullet because their controllers know that they cannot be trusted. This has
happened in the past a number of times on a number of different occasions.

Eldon is a person who would give his life for his fellow human being to live
in freedom. I have known Eldon for at least ten years. He is of impeccable
character and always ready to help.

I am asking now for help from everyone of you. Please write a letter in his
support to the Attorney General of British Columbia and the courts. Fax your
letter to every MLA in British Columbia. God knows, Eldon deserves every
possible support. If enough people write the real goons will not be able to
withstand the pressure YOU can exert on them. Proof to yourself that it
works. I know it works. I have experienced it many times. I have seen the
results. Please take a paper and a pen and write a letter in Eldon's support
so he might be able to help other people again, maybe even yourself.

DIP for December 30

I have tried to file a Habeas Corpus for Eldon today, without success.
Tomorrow Eldon will be transferred to Revelstoke, BC. I was unable to find
out by what means, car or plane. I have just faxed the following letter to
the clerk of the court in Revelstoke. Please call or fax the clerk of the
court also. The phone number is (250)837-4525. The fax number is
(250)837-5682 


To: 

Clerk of the Court 

Provincial Court of British-Columbia

Revelstoke 

250 837-5682 

From: 

Ernst-Friedrich: Kyburz

Coleman, Alberta 

403 562-8463 

Subject matter: 

Eldon-Gerald: Warman

charges against him and the consequences for the Court

December 29, AD 1999


Mr. Eldon-Gerald: Warman sent November 15, AD 1999 his
AFFIDAVIT - DENIAL OF JURISDICTION

to the Provincial Court of British-Columbia at Revelstoke in
British-Columbia in regards to the charges against himself. He never
received an answer to the Affidavit. Therefore Mr. Warman's statements have
been acknowledged and accepted.

Mr. Warman was arrested December 27, 1999, more than thirty days after the
court received his Affidavit and about ninety minutes after he was released
from hospital. He was undergoing surgery for a kidney stone. He was arrested
without an arrest warrant, the police officers pushed their way into the
house without identifying themselves and without a search warrant. The same
police officers threatened the people present in the house at the time.
Additionally one of the two police officers coming to the house around 10:15
PM Christmas day threatened me that "they will come back with a search
warrant and tear the house apart. It will be a real mess."

It seems to me that the  justice system' is falsely called justice system
since the people in the  justice system' violate the law of the land
habitually in a criminal manner. I have made this experience myself on
several occasions. I have found that people in this system do not hesitate
to lie, steal, threaten and even participate in murder, directly and
indirectly. 

I was myself in jail for 3 ½ weeks in Lethbridge. I demanded to be
corrected. I was told by a guard that: "We don't want to correct you. We
want your money." Again this is a clear indication that courts and their
rulings have nothing to do with justice, it's all about money. This
statement coincides with the words of a police officer. He told me: "Our
justice system has nothing to do with justice. It's all about money."

Would it be incorrect to call the justice system a legal mafia? Would it be
incorrect to label police officers  thugs', hired and paid by the
government? Would it be out of line to call the people we generally see as
our  representatives' "Minions of Luciferian Assassins"? The
 representatives' I am referring to are also known as MLAs (Members of the
Legislative Assembly). The MLAs of Alberta and British Columbia acknowledged
that they are participating in the worldwide  elimination' program of two
billion people by the year 2000.  Elimination' is synonymous with  killing'.
How do the  Minions of Luciferian Assassins' get rid of their fellow human
beings? Easy! They get the help of the lawyers and judges who design,
implement and enforce government programs like vaccination, fluoridation,
medication, etc., etc. These programs are all designed and implemented by
lawyers who run the courts and the government. Judges are lawyers also.

Mr. Warman has sent the court in Revelstoke his Affidavit for denial of
jurisdiction. A copy went to the AG of British Columbia, the AG of Alberta,
the Justice Minister of Canada. No one even acknowledged his common law
document. The court in Revelstoke disregarded his demand of dropping the
charges and arrested him 41 days after the court received his demand.
Obviously the judges, lawyers and government officials have elevated
themselves above the law. They operate in a state of lawlessness. How can
any of you, judges, lawyers or government officials, have the gall to sit in
judgment over decent and law abiding citizens?

Now, since you, the lawyers and judges, make these laws and hire the thugs
to enforce these laws in violation of our rights and freedoms, you of course
will also  protect' your hired thugs like Brian Harris.

What recourse have we, the people, against the legal mafia you are running?
How can we defend ourselves from the rogue and criminal elements in society
calling themselves judges and lawyers? How can we extricate ourselves from
your evil and murderous programs and the criminally imposed admiralty law?
How can we bring back the common law - the law of the land?

I was told that Mr.Warman was to be transferred tomorrow to Revelstoke in
order to be brought before the court. I called the Remand Centre in Calgary
where he presently is being held. They could not give me any info when he
will be picked up. I went to the Court House this afternoon to file a Habeas
Corpus. The court clerk did not know what this was all about, never seen
anything like it. When I see this type of ignorance by people whose duty it
is to uphold the law I very often loose my cool. The same happened this
afternoon. The girl asked what this was all about. I told her that it was
about Eldon Warman. They did not have any info on Mr. Warman. She asked
about the charges. I told her that he was picked up without arrest warrant,
without any explanation. Not knowing where to look further she called the
Remand Centre and was told that Mr. Warman had an assault charge against
himself. 

Mr. Warman received the first indication for the reason of his arrest in the
Remand Centre. He was told that he is charged with
1) "diatribes against government"
2) assaulting a police officer
3) disturbing court proceedings in Edmonton

To point 1) It seems to me that government cannot tolerate when a citizen is
unveiling the truth about government corruption and criminality. I say:
CHANGE YOUR WAYS AND OBEY THE LAW SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO EXPOSE YOUR
CRIMINALITY! 

To point 2) Mr. Warman acted in self-defence against a paid government thug.
Again: CHANGE YOUR WAYS SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST YOUR
PAID THUGS 

To point 3) If you can't find any REAL violations committed by Mr. Warman
leave him alone and do the job you are supposed to do. Mr. Warman hasn't
been in Edmonton for quite sometime. When he was in Edmonton he certainly
did not engage or participate in any way shape or form in disrupting court
proceedings. 

I would suggest you let Mr. Warman go free if you cannot find any REAL
complaints against him, or transgressions of the law committed by him (by
transgressions of the law I mean transgressions of  the law of the land'). I
certainly cannot think of any man more conscientious and honourable than Mr.
Eldon Warman. I only wish we had people of his character and integrity in
the Legislature. If people like Mr. Warman would hold positions in
government our country would not participate in terrorist actions and murder
campaigns like the Prime Terrorist of Canada (Jean Chretien) and his gang
engage in. 

I want to mention here the words of Marcus Tullius Cicero. He lived from 106
- 43 B.C. He stated:
Power and law are not synonymous. In truth they are frequently in opposition
and irreconcilable. There is God's Law from which all Equitable laws of man
emerge and by which men must live if they are not to die in oppression,
chaos and despair. Divorced from God's eternal and immutable Law,
established before the founding of the suns, man's power is evil no matter
the noble words with which it is employed or the motives urged when
enforcing it. Men of good will, mindful therefore of the Law laid down by
God, will oppose governments whose rule is by men, and if they wish to
survive as a nation they will destroy the government which attempts to
adjudicate by the whim of venal judges.

(Venal means: Easily bribed or corrupted )

It seems that things have not changed in the past two thousand years. Judges
seem to be more corrupt than ever. I have made firsthand experiences. Many
people have been victimized by the courts and the law profession. The frauds
and criminal minds of the court system have to be exposed to the fullest. We
have no other choice left. We are waiting to see what the judge and
prosecutor will have to say and how Brian Harris, the Motor Carrier
Inspector will justify HIS actions against Eldon Warman.

I want you to understand that the base we are working from is the legal
maxim: 
"Those who do not preserve the law of the land, then justly incur the
ineffaceable brand of infamy. "

You have opened a can of worms by violating Mr. Warman's rights to the free
use of the highways and protecting the actions of your government paid thug,
Mr. Brian Harris. You have disregarded Mr. Warman's Affidavit, duly and
properly written and delivered. We will have to open people's eyes to what
you are really doing against us on a daily basis. We will have to expose you
to the fullest because our rights and freedoms - even our lives - depend on
it. 

Mr. Warman's surgical procedure is incomplete and requires further hospital
care beginning of next week. In the meantime it is expected that he is
feverish and painful. In the hospital he was heavily sedated with morphine,
demerol and he had a general anaesthetic. All of these drugs diminish the
mental capacity for several months. How can he be expected to properly and
effectively defend himself in this condition? His rights are being violated
here again. 

The combined actions, beginning with Brian Harris' refusal to identify
himself and proof jurisdiction to Mr. Warman, to the court's disregard of
the Affidavit, the criminal behaviour of the Calgary City police, the
ridiculous charges against Mr. Warman made up by the Alberta government,
prove without a shadow of a doubt that the governments and the courts are
devious and criminal to the core. We will have to expose to the fullest
everyone involved in Mr. Warman's wrongful incarceration and harassment. We
will have to make known to the world the devilish program the MLAs, the
lawyers and judges subject us to.

I demand justice to be done in Mr. Warman's case. You have failed to answer
Mr. Warman's Affidavit. As a result the charges against him have to be
dropped. Mr. Warman has to be set free immediately.

Yours truly, 

Fred Kyburz

DIP for December 29, 1999

Eldon called me today just as I was in the process of writing another letter
to every Alberta MLA. It was perfect timing. It gave me the opportunity to
incorporate his message in the letter.

Eldon told me that he finally found out WHY he was arrested. There were
three reasons for his arrest.
1) He wrote "diatribes against government".
2) Assault on a police officer in British Columbia
3) Disruption of court proceedings in Edmonton, Alberta.

The people in government are very resourceful in creating lies. NONE of the
above accusation have any truth to themselves. No wonder they have to employ
thugs with guns (so-called 'peace officers') to keep the public in line and
under control. I wrote the following letter to every MLA in Alberta. You can
also copy the letter and send it to the MLAs. The addresses are at the
bottom of the page. Please remove my name and replace it with yours. You can
also compose your own letter. If enough people write these MLAs we will
slowly destroy their bastion of lies, deceit and treachery. Will you be part
of this important work?

Here is the letter I wrote today:

Dear Sir, 

I have to write you again on the matter of Mr. Warman. You received my
previous letter with Mr. Warman's Affidavit. I did not receive a reply from
you as of this moment. Mr. Warman has not received a reply from anyone
either since close to two months. So I am not surprised that no one replied
to my letter. 

Mr. Warman was released from the Rockyview Hospital yesterday afternoon at
around 2:30. At the time he was visited by a few of his friends. All of them
came to his house for a coffee. Within a little over an hour the police
where at the door. I was not there at the time. What transpired was that the
police pushed their way into the house without producing an arrest warrant,
without a search warrant and without identifying themselves. Additionally
the police threatened Mr. Warman's friends. The police violated the law in a
criminal manner on a number of occasions. And these are the people entrusted
with upholding law and order. Talk about the fox in charge of the chicken
coop! 

Mr. Warman sent his Affidavit to the court of British Columbia in
Revelstoke. The Attorney General of BC, Mr. Ujjal Dosanjh; the Attorney
General of Alberta, Mr. David Hancock; the Justice Minister of Canada and
Art Hanger, the Reform Party Justice Critic received a copy of his Affidavit
with a request for redress in his case. Mr. Warman hasn't heard from anyone
except Art Hanger's office. Art Hanger's secretary advised him that his
request was forwarded to Preston Manning, the leader of the Reform Party,
with the explanation that he was no longer the Justice Critic. The silence
of anyone in government is deafening!

This morning I read an article in the Calgary Herald about the fire bombing
of the BC Attorney General's constituency office in Vancouver. Apparently
many people are disgruntled with the Attorney General's handling of a wide
variety of issues, which, in most cases, simply means the lawlessness of his
actions against innocent people.

I want to make sure you understand that no number of police will prevent the
recoil of your own criminal acts against your fellow citizens upon yourself.
Those criminal acts include the wilful destruction of our rights and
freedoms with the help of corrupt police officers. You will have to face,
sooner or later, the harm you inflict upon people who entrusted you with
upholding the common law - the law of the land.

* * * 

DIP for December 28

I continue updating the DIPs regarding Eldon Warman. It will be easier to
follow the progress of Eldon's ordeal.

I have had a very busy day yesterday. Eldon had his operation on December
26th. and he was released yesterday (December 27) at around 2:30 in the
afternoon. Several people were in his room paying him a visit at the time.
All came to his house where he is rooming. Eldon felt all right, as good as
somebody feels after an operation. Ruth and myself left for a few errands,
including dropping off letters to three police sergeants and a letter to the
RCMP headquarters in Calgary.

The RCMP was closed. Isn't it interesting to find the police closed over the
Holidays with a note at the door that they will open again December 29th?

The same situation we found yesterday when delivering a letter to a Sergeant
of the Midnapore police station. It was closed also. I was always under the
impression that the public had access to the police in case of an emergency.
This obviously is not the case any longer. Folks, if you are in trouble the
police is not there to help you. Get used to it! It's a fairy tale we
believe in that the police will help us. The police is here only to keep us
in line for the purpose of government control of the masses.

Below you can read the letter I wrote today to three Calgary Police
Sergeants. 

Dear Officers, 

I am writing on behalf of Mr. Eldon Warman. Mr. Warman is presently in the
hospital for kidney stone treatment. On four consecutive nights police
officers showed up at his home in Calgary (702-54 Ave, SW.) with the claim
of having to arrest him, yet never producing an arrest warrant. Some of the
officers behaved very rude and threatening. For example one of the two
officers coming to the house on Christmas night after 10P.M. said when he
was refused the location of Mr. Warman's whereabouts: "I will come back with
a search warrant and I will tear the house apart. It will be a mess." The
lady of the house called in the meantime the police station which resulted
in them being called off. Two days previously the lady of the house allowed
an officer to search the house without a search warrant. In other words, she
was compliant with officers over and above the requirement by law.

The two police officers coming to the door Christmas night engaged in
threats, intimidation and harassment against the lady of the house. Such
behavior is NOT warranted for any peace officer. Peace officers do not
disturb the peace, they uphold the peace and the law. Today's police
officers claim to be 'peace officers' yet they do not do the job of a 'peace
officer'. They simply are impostors. They impersonate a 'peace officer' in
the course of their new duty of protecting the system from the people.
Impersonating a 'peace officer' is a criminal offense.

Apart from this the 'peace officers' are serving under the color of the
United Nations, the most rogue organization man has ever brought into being.
By serving the United Nations they serve an 'outside power'. In actual fact
they commit constructive treason against Canada and her citizen. Treason
carries the death penalty.

How can we, the citizens, trust people who impersonate 'peace officers' and
commit constructive treason? The more people finding out the truth about the
actual duty of the police (protecting the system from the people) vs their
supposed duty (protecting people's rights and freedoms against government
intrusion and upholding the peace and tranquility) the harder it will become
for the police. The system erected a wall between the police and the people.
The system needs this wall between police and the people in order to have
the police on its side.

How can you police officers justify deceiving your fellow citizen and
actively helping in destroying our rights and freedoms? How can you justify
pushing us with your actions into slavery? Don't you understand that you
will destroy your own rights and freedoms in the course of destroying ours?
Don't you understand that you destroy your families' rights and freedoms by
destroying ours? How can you?

Please do your part in stopping this abuse of power and criminal intent of
destroying our free common law society.
