e.Digital's Portable Internet Music Player Design to Support Secure 
Digital --SD-- Memory Card

LAS VEGAS, Jan 7, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Company Joins New Secure 
Digital (SD) Association 

Formed by Matsushita, Toshiba, and SanDisk   e.Digital Corp. 
(OTCBB:EDIG) announced today that its portable Internet music player 
design will be one of the first to feature compatibility with the new, 
Secure Digital (SD) Memory Card announced in August 1999 by SanDisk, 
Toshiba, and Matsushita, best known by its Panasonic brand name. 

e.Digital is also an inaugural member of the newly-formed SD 
Association announced during a Matsushita/Toshiba/SanDisk press 
conference yesterday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2000. 

Fred Falk, president and chief executive officer of e.Digital, said, 
"We are happy to be part of the newly-formed SD Association, as one of 
its stated goals is to provide improved protection for copyrighted 
content, including but not limited to music files. The SD Memory Card 
is another valuable tool we can use in our endeavors to offer our OEM 
customers designs that will support SDMI standards for secure Internet 
music." He added, "For years we have built compatibility into our 
designs for SanDisk memory products, which have become the de facto 
standard for portable devices." 

Nelson Chan, senior vice president of marketing for SanDisk added, "We 
are very proud of the SD Memory Card, especially its security features 
which are becoming more and more important to our customers. Digital 
security is being pursued on many levels, and the SD Memory Card is 
there to support these efforts in portable devices of all kinds." He 
continued, "We are pleased to have e.Digital join the SD Association as 
an inaugural member, as they are one of the first to incorporate 
compatibility for SD Memory into a portable product design." 

e.Digital's portable multi-codec Internet music player design is 
available for licensing by consumer electronics manufacturers and other 
OEM partners. The flexible design can be adapted to customer 
specifications and includes support for multiple music codecs, 
removable memory, and security features. The design is SDMI compatible.
