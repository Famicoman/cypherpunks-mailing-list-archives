<p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>To IO Report Members:</font></font></b><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Welcome to the 21st Century.&nbsp;
Consider people's lifestyle at the turn of the last century as opposed
to today.&nbsp; Now try to visualize life at the end of this century.&nbsp;
It boggles the mind.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>We have a lot of exciting programs
planned for Year 2,000.&nbsp; Here are two upcoming events you will want
to put on your calendar:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>On Wednesday, January 12th, we will
be introducing our members to the first<u> Private Placement</u> opportunity
that we have ever covered.&nbsp; This is not a solicitation to buy or sell
any securities.&nbsp; It is simply a referral to a company that we believe
will go public in the next one to two years, and is currently raising capital
to fund their expansion.&nbsp; We will give you the facts and the mechanism
to contact the company directly if you are interested.&nbsp; This is a
true "Ground Floor" opportunity that could yield huge returns, but is also
very risky.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>On Friday, January 14th we will be
rolling out our January profile.&nbsp; This is a technology company with
breakthrough potential that is incredible.&nbsp; Get ready to read the
profile and see if you don't agree.</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><u><font face="Verdana">Market Comment</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>We believe that the current correction
in the Technology Sector is a new phenomenon that we have never seen before.&nbsp;
For lack of a better description, we will call it an <b>"Inverted January
Effect".</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The term <b>January Effect </b>refers
to the annual year end sell off in poorly performing securities.&nbsp;
Investors tend to sell their losers at the end of the year for tax purposes.&nbsp;
Due to the seasonal absence of buyers, many of these securities become
"Oversold", and tend to bounce back once the year end selling pressure
is off and buyers resurface.&nbsp; This is known as the <b>January Effect</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>We believe that there is a new twist
on this old theme occurring this year.&nbsp; We had a meteoric rise in
the value of technology stocks in the 4th Quarter of 1999.&nbsp; The NASDAQ
Index was up 85% in 1999, setting a new record for any index in the history
of stocks.&nbsp; The majority of those gains came after October 1st.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Fund managers and retail investors
were sitting on huge profits at the end of the year.&nbsp; No one wanted
to sell due to tax considerations.&nbsp; Retail investors that waited until
after the first of the year to take profits delayed the tax consequences
until April of 2001, buying themselves 12 months on tax liabilities.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Fund managers enjoyed outstanding
performance statistics on their funds at year end.&nbsp; Selling pressure
from fund managers would have inhibited that performance and created tax
problems for their investors.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>We believe that this <b>"Inverted
January Effect" </b>resulted in enormous pent up demand to take profits
right after the first of the year, and the markets sold off in a short
term blood bath this week.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Our guess is that most of the damage
has been done, and there are now some lower risk entry levels for both
small and large cap stocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; A more ominous stumbling block
for the markets is rising interest rates.&nbsp; This will have the effect
of cooling off the market until there is a perception that interest rate
increases have come to an end.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>All in all, we believe it will be
a great year for both small and large cap stocks.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><u><font face="Verdana">PawnBroker.Com (OTC BB: PBRR) Update</font></u></b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><b>Pawnbroker</b> is our most current
profile.&nbsp; We released it on December 10th when the stock closed at
$7.&nbsp; Within two days the stock traded as high as $9, but drifted back
down to the $7 range during the Christmas Holiday season.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>With our previous profile <b>Blue
Zone (OTC BB: BLZN)</b> trading in the $8 range (a 60% increase from its
profiled price), and <b>Infowave (TSE: IW)</b> screaming up the charts
on huge volume (up nearly 10 points in the last week), we thought an update
on <b>Pawnbroker</b> might be appropriate as the market is continuing to
provide a favorable entry level for this stock.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>If you didn't have a chance to read
the original profile, simply <a href="http://www.smallcapdigest.com/profiles/pbrr/19991211-1.html">click
here</a> and you will be taken directly to it.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>We caught up with the President of
the Company, <b>Neil McElwee</b>, today in between flights and had a chance
to ask some questions.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Here is what we learned.&nbsp; The
current target date for a full commercial launch of the <b>Pawnbroker.com</b>
site is now mid March.&nbsp; They are building a framework that will allow
the site to handle up to 100,000 transactions per minute.&nbsp; They don't
want to make the same mistakes that <b>EBay (NASDAQ: EBAY)</b> made in
their original back end structure.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>When they launch the site there will
be <b>200,000 items</b> for sale from pawnshops nationwide.&nbsp; Over
the next three weeks the company will be hosting demos in most of the major
US Cities for pawnbrokers.&nbsp; Pawnshops are signing up at a rapid rate,
and that is expected to accelerate.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>They are including an inventory management
system in the Pawnshop Package that will automatically integrate inventory
control systems so that items which have been sold do not appear on the
site.&nbsp; They are also building out a private Intranet for Pawnbroker
to Pawnbroker transactions and inventory management system which will have
a transaction based revenue model.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>In two weeks will be attending the
demo in San Diego, and we will get our first look at the functionality
of the system and the site.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Mr. McElwee</font></font></b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>
would not share any information with us about the progress of the relationship
with Jeffries &amp; Co., their Wall Street Investment Banking Firm.&nbsp;
However he did tell us that they only need to add a Board member to meet
all the qualifications for a NASDAQ listing, and he implied that they would
be applying soon.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>We believe that this company will
receive an unprecedented amount of press coverage when the unveil their
site.&nbsp; Baring any market condition disasters, we don't believe that
the stock will be trading any where near these levels when they launch.</font></font>

<br><font size=-1>Remember, invest wisely and with caution.&nbsp; It's
your hard earned money, so be careful.&nbsp; If there is no major news
from any of our covered companies our next newsletter will be out Wednesday
with the first Private Placement we have ever featured.</font>
