RUMP SESSION

In addition to the regular conference program, a rump session will be

organized during the conference itself, advance proposals may be
submitted by email.  Rump session contributions will not appear in the
conference proceedings.  An award of $350 in e-gold will be awarded to
the best rump session presentation.


EXHIBITION

An exhibition will be held in conjunction with the technical program,
with product displays, demonstrations, and presentations of a
business-oriented nature.  Scientific sessions are primarily scheduled
for the mornings and exhibition sessions for the afternoons.


CONFERENCE VENUE

The conference will be held at Chandeliers, the conference facility of
the InterIsland Hotel, which is on Road Bay, near Sandy Ground
Village, in the South Hill section of Anguilla.  The conference will
have TCP/IP internet access.  Shuttle service between the conference
and the Mariners hotel will be available.

Registration can be done via the web at URL <A  HREF="http://fc00.ai/">http://fc00.ai/</A>.  The fee

GENERAL INFORMATION

Visas

Visas are not required for citizens of most American and European
countries.  If you are uncertain about whether you need a visa,
contact the local British consulate for information.

Getting to Anguilla

 From North America, Anguilla is usually reached via San Juan (Puerto
Rico).  From Europe, the best connections are via
St. Maarten/St. Martin (from Amsterdam or Paris), or Antigua (from
London).  St. Martin is very close to Anguilla and is connected by
ferry as well as by plane.

Local Transportation

The simplest way to get around Anguilla is to rent a car.  You will
need to buy an Anguilla drivers license, but this is a formality.
Taxis are also available.  Another possibility is to hitch rides from
local residents, who are eager to provide them and will often stop to
offer rides unsolicited.  Transportation will be provided at specific
times between Mariners and the InterIsland hotel.

Weather

Expect temperatures in the 20's or 30's Celsius, 70's or 80's
Fahrenheit.  There is often a strong wind, with cloudbursts that
quickly blow over.  Dress code for the conference is shorts and
T-shirt.

Money

The local currency is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$), with an
exchange rate of approximately EC$2.7/US$1, but many goods and
services in Anguilla, particularly those aimed primarily at tourists
(such as restaurants and hotels) are priced in US dollars.  US dollars
are freely tradable everywhere on the island, so there is no need to
obtain EC dollars before arrival.
