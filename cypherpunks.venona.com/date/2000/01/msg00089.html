How large is the horticulture
market? Gardening is considered to be the number one hobby in North America.&nbsp;
The Canadian consumer spending has grown to approximately $10 billion.&nbsp; In
the U.S., the total figure generated by landscape and horticulture is
approximately $25 billion annually, with the niche landscape market generating
an additional $14 billion per year, eclipsing the $15 billion spent yearly on Golf.  Let's
Landscape (together),
Inc. has aggressive expansion plans for their franchise network. Their current 6
franchised operations have averaged, in actual start-up sales, of $200,000 to
over $800,000 in three years, and are expected to generate well over $1 million
in their forth year. New franchise start-ups in the year 2000, are expected to
produce revenues of over $500,000 in their first year. Already, approximately 6
new franchised locations are planned to open in year 2000. With planned
expansion into the United States and total outlets to increase to over 200, the
company's projected revenues are expected to be approximately $750 million
within five years, a figure that constitutes less than 2% of the total market
share.</font></p>
