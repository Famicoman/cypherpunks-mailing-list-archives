        Critical Information about HP-UX Remote Watch

   CIAC has obtained information from Hewlett Packard
   regarding a new security vulnerability in Remote Watch
   contained in the WATCH-RUN fileset for releases of HP-UX. 
   Appendix I provides detailed patch information for the HP
   Remote Watch vulnerability.


   The document /pub/ciac/bulletin/f-fy95/hppatchs.txt has
   been updated to reflect this bulletin.  The hppatchs.txt
   document contains the entire list of all HP Bulletins and
   patches and is available on our FTP server ciac.llnl.gov.


   HP has an automatic server to allow patches and other
   security information to be retrieved over the Internet.  To
   utilize this server, send an e-mail message to
   support@support.mayfield.hp.com.  The subject line of the
   message is ignored and the body (text) of the message
   should contain the words


   send XXXX


   where XXXX is the identifier for the information you want
   retrieved.  For example, to retrieve the patch PHSS_4834,
   the message would be "send PHSS_4834".


   Other information that can be retrieved include the HP
   SupportLine mail service user's guide (send guide.txt), the
   readme file for a patch and the original HP bulletin (send
   doc HPSBUX9501-020).


   HP also has a World Wide Web server to browse and retrieve
   bulletins and patches.  To utilize this server, use a WWW
   client and connect to <A  HREF="http://support.mayfield.hp.com">http://support.mayfield.hp.com</A>.


   IMPORTANT NOTE: Hewlett Packard updates patches
   periodically.  These updates are not reflected in the text
   of each HP bulletin.  The overview presented here contains
   current information on the patches available at the time of
   the release of this CIAC bulletin.  If you request an
   updated patch, when you try to retrieve the patch you will
   receive a message stating that the patch is obsolete and
   the name of the patch which supersedes it.


   Hewlett Packard has made sum and MD5 checksums available
   for their patches and for their security bulletins.  See
   the detailed explanation for HPSBUX9408-016 in CIAC
   bulletin F-02 for information on how to access and utilize
   these checksums.

   This vulnerability can allow users to increase their access
   privileges which may result in system compromise.  All HP
   300/400 and 700/800 series machines running HP-UX 8.x or
   9.x which have Remote Watch installed are affected.


   The patch to install depends on which operating system
   version and machine series you are currently using.  Use
   the following table to determine which patch to retrieve
   and install:


   Operating System      Series    Apply patch

   HP-UX 8.x             800       PHSS_5185
   HP-UX 9.x             800       PHSS_5136
   HP-UX 8.x             700       PHSS_5180
