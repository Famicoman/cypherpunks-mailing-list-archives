                     Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release					February 2, 1995


      STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT NAMING MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION
    ON THE ROLES AND CAPABILITIES OF THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY


     I am announcing today appointments to the Congressionally- mandated
Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United States
Intelligence Community.  The Commission will be chaired by the current
chairman of my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Les Aspin.  Former
Senator Warren Rudman will serve as the vice chairman and I have asked
General Lew Allen, Jr., Zoe Baird, Ann Caracristi, Stephen Friedman,
Anthony S. Harrington, Robert J. Hermann, and Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz
to serve as well.

     These distinguished Americans will join the eight members appointed
by the leadership of the 103rd Congress.  They are Tony Coelho, David
Dewhurst, Representative Norm Dicks, Senator James Exon, former Senator
Wyche Fowler, Representative Porter Goss, General Robert Pursley and
Senator John Warner.

     Intelligence remains a critical element of our national power and
influence.  For over 40 years bipartisan support for the work performed
by U.S.  intelligence has been essential to the creation of an
intelligence capability that is second to none.  While the world has
changed in dramatic ways, our need to retain the advantage that U.S.
intelligence provides our country remains constant.

     With the end of the Cold War we must renew and reinvigorate this
bipartisan support.  The foundation for this support must begin with a
thorough assessment of the kind of intelligence community we will need
to address the security challenges of the future.  Our objective is to
strengthen U.S. intelligence, to ensure it has the management, skills
and resources needed to successfully pursue our national security
interests through the next decade and beyond.  It is an effort to which
I attach the highest personal priority.

     I am confident that Les Aspin, Warren Rudman and the other
outstanding members of this Commission will work cooperatively with the
leadership of the intelligence community and the Congress to ensure
continued bipartisan support for this critical mission.  And I know that
their effort will ensure the continued trust of the American people in
the outstanding and often unheralded work performed by the men and women
of U.S. intelligence.
