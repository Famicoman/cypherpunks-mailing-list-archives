In this 38-page booklet, you will  learn how the government and business,
through the extensive use of super-computers, is compiling data on ever
facet of your life.  Discover exactly how they do it.  The amount of
information kept on you is astounding: bank statements, investments,
credit histories, medical records, school transcripts, driving histories,
videotape rentals, retail purchases, tax returns, legal records, and more!
This booklet explains who is collecting information on you and what they
are doing with it.  Your dossier is compiled and sold without your
