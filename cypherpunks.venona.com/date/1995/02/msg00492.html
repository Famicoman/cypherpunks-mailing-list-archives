I've got a solution that everyone should love:

Let's go ahead and allow illegally obtained evidence - but let's
make it a capital offense for a law-enforcement officer to 
knowingly violate the 4th amendment.  

Strong 4th amendment protection and another wonderful death
penalty all in one!

&gt; With all the gafawing about the bill (666) which just flew by, and the 
&gt; "Dem's" running off about how the constitution is being dismantled, I 
&gt; thought I would cite some case law.
&gt; 
&gt; I direct your attention to _United States v. Leon_, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).
&gt; 
&gt; Justice White:
&gt; 
&gt; This case presents the question whether the Fourth Ammendment 
&gt; exclusionary rule should be modified so as not to bar the use in the 
&gt; prosecution's case-in-chief of evidence obtained by officers acting in 
&gt; reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral 
&gt; magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; The Fourth Amendment contains no provision expressly precluding the use 
&gt; of evidence obtained by violation if its commands, and an examination of 
&gt; its orgin and purposes makes clear that the use of fruits of a past 
&gt; unlawful search or seizure "work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong."  The 
&gt; wrong condemned by the Amendment is "fully accomplished" by the unlawful 
&gt; search or seizure itself, and the exclusionary rule is neither intended 
&gt; nor able to "cure the invasion of the defendant's rights which he has 
&gt; already suffered."  The rule thus operates as "a judicially created 
&gt; remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through 
&gt; its deterrant effect, rahter than a personal constitutional right of the 
&gt; person aggrieved."
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; First, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct 
&gt; rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.  Second, 
&gt; there exists no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are 
&gt; inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness 
&gt; among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; [The exclusionary rule cannot be expected to deter objectively reasonable 
&gt; law enforcement activity...]
&gt; 
&gt; This is particularly true, we believe, when an officer acting with objective
&gt; good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted
&gt; within its scope.  In most such cases, there is no police illegality and this
&gt; nothing to deter. It is the magistrate's responsibility to determine whether
&gt; the officer's allegations estlablish probable cause and, if so, to issue a
&gt; warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
&gt; In the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the
&gt; magistrate's probable-cause determination or his judgement that the form of
&gt; the warrant is technically sufficent.  "[O]nce the warrant issues, there is 
&gt; literally nothing more the policeman can do in seeking to comply with the 
&gt; law."  Penalizing the officer for the magistrate's error, rather than his 
&gt; own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment 
&gt; violations.
&gt; 
&gt; END.
&gt; ++++
&gt; 
&gt; The bill is really just a restatement.  This has been the state of the 
&gt; law for 11 years now.
&gt; 
&gt; If the bill fails, the essence of the doctrine that everyone is concerned 
&gt; about stands in any event.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is moot.
