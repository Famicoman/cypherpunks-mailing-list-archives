The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy

Sponsored by:          * ACM SIGCOMM, SIGCAS, SIGSAC, and
                       * Stanford Law School

28 - 31 March 1995
San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel
Burlingame, California

CONNECT WITH OTHERS WHO ARE DETERMINING HOW COMPUTERS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
WILL AFFECT YOUR FREEDOM AND PRIVACY... 

JOIN US AT CFP'95.

We have reached the crossroads of the Information Age.

No longer is the electronic frontier inhabited solely by a small band of 
technical pioneers sharing a common code of conduct. Computer and 
telecommunications technologies have become part of mainstream living, 
conversation, and politics. These changes compel us to reexamine the 
definition of our rights and the processes by which those rights are being 
defined. 

The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble experts,
advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of disciplines and
backgrounds in a balanced public forum to explore and better understand the
definition of our rights at this crossroads.

Participants will include people from the fields of computer science, law,
business, research, information, library science, health, public policy,
government, law enforcement, public advocacy, and many others.

Featured speakers include:

John P. Morgridge, Chairman, Cisco Systems
Esther Dyson, Release 1.0/EDVenture Holdings, Inc.
Roger W. Wilkins, Professor of History and American Culture at George 
	Mason University and commentator, National Public Radio
Margaret Jane Radin, Professor of Law, Stanford University
Willis H. Ware, RAND 

Some of the topics in the CFP'95 program include:

FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY OF ELECTRONIC SPEECH -- Exploring recent
controversies in online free speech, including a Socratic forum
that will ask whether the Constitution can indeed be viewed through a
technologically transparent lens.

HIS MASTER'S VOICE... -- Probing the future for "net propaganda" from
governments, government officials, and politicians, and who will pay 
so whose message will get to whom.

STUDENT DATABASES: FOR EDUCATION AND FOR LIFE? -- Looking at how gaining the
benefits of nationwide information about K-12 students could also spell
serious privacy problems.

CAN THE NET SURVIVE COPYRIGHT? CAN COPYRIGHT SURVIVE THE NET? -- Delving
into the controversies surrounding copyright protection that throttles 
freedoms and copyright protection that protects just rewards for creativity.

INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS: PAVING OVER PRIVACY -- Examining the
privacy implications of tracking and surveillance technologies now being
planned for vehicles and roadways nationwide.

"IT OUGHTA BE A CRIME..." -- Debating with law enforcement representatives
about who should set the rules for governing the net and when should bad 
manners become a crime.

WHEN DO THEY NEED TO KNOW 'WHODUNNIT'? -- Discussing the right time and
places for identified, anonymous, and pseudonymous transactions.

TRANSACTION RECORDS IN INTERACTIVE SERVICES: WHO WATCHES THE SERVERS? --
Looking at the issues raised by the collection of personal information
as part of the new interactive home entertainment, telecommunications,
and online services.

DEFINING ACCESS PARADIGMS: LIBRARIES, RURAL AREAS, AND INTERNATIONAL 
ASPECTS -- Evaluating the differing models of "open access" to Internet and
computer-mediated communications in the library, rural, and lesser-developed
country contexts.

THE CASE AGAINST COMPUTERS: A SYSTEMIC CRITIQUE -- Daring to discuss whether
computers may be doing our world more harm than good.

A NET FOR ALL: WHERE ARE THE MINORITIES? -- Examining how and to what degree
minority groups participate on the net and asking whether social class is
relevant to net participation or non-participation.

WHO OWNS THE LAW? -- Reviewing the debate over legal citation form and online
databases, and what it means to all of us.

CAN WE TALK LONG-DISTANCE? REMOVING IMPEDIMENTS TO SECURE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNICATIONS -- Covering export and import controls, outright prohibitions,
and other technical and policy obstacles to secure international
communications.

The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy will also offer a 
number of in-depth tutorials on subjects including:

   *	Inside Washington: The New Congress and Secrets of Advocacy
   *	National ID Card Initiatives
   *	The Law of Fundamental Rights for Non-Lawyers 
   *	Everything You Need to Know to Argue About Cryptography
