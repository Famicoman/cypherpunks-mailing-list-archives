&gt; &gt; They *do* have to prove intent -- as to how, that's what juries are 
&gt; &gt; for.  BTW, he used her real name in the post, with no disclaimers 
&gt; &gt; about fiction.  From what I have heard, if he had said the same thing 
&gt; &gt; in her presence, he could have been arrested for assault.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on the NY Times article I've read, you're omitting some important
&gt; extenuating circumstances here. For one thing, it was apparently posted to
&gt; alt.sex.stories, which seems to obviate the use of "fictional" disclaimers.
&gt; Furthermore, he did _not_ identify her as a UMich student.
&gt; 
Well, I was quoting a small AP story in a paper notorious for
clipping articles short, so I knew that some [if not many]
circumstances would be missing.  In conversations today at
Potlatch 4 I learned of other circumstances, albeit not
necessarily what I would call "extenuating" ones.  And the
lawyers, of course, will be spin controlling from now until a
verdict.

&gt; I don't see the relevance of "if he had said the same thing in her presence".
&gt; He *didn't* !  There's an enormous difference between making a comment about
&gt; a person to third parties, and making the comment to that person.
&gt; 
Not necessarily -- there's lots of case law that the threatened
person need not be present to be threatened.  The people present
are still witnesses.  I agree there's a difference, but its nature
isn't obvious.  Precisely what that difference is is up to judges,
juries and [goddess help us!] legislators.

&gt; According to the NY Times story, the woman mentioned in the story only heard
&gt; about it because reporters asked her about it !  I find a great deal of irony
&gt; in the report that the controversy started because an alt.sex.stories reader
&gt; in _Moscow_ tipped off the UMich authorities.
&gt; 
Irony noted and appreciated -- but it does illustrate the "public" 
nature of the forum.

&gt; It appears that the Russians are allowed to read erotic fiction, while the
&gt; Americans are forbidden to read it, and get tossed in jail for writing it.
&gt; We've come a long way, baby. Yeah.

I was in high school while the Supremes [the real Supremes, with 
Earl Warren, not the bogus nostalgia group currently wearing the 
black robes] were doing the decisions that allowed Joyce and Lawrence 
to be sold in bookstores, and I was taught Shakespeare from a 
bowlderized edition of Romeo &amp; Juliet.  Trust me, we aren't in a 
place remotely like that now [not that there aren't plenty of people 
trying to get back there].

Which is not to say I'm complacent -- when I have money to spare from 
Green work, it goes to the ACLU.  Eternal vigilance and all that.  
And this dude is entitled to presumption of innocence, a jury trial, 
and all the other paraphenalia of procedural liberty.

However, given the information available to date, I see no reason to 
believe that he's been busted for writing "erotic fiction"  rather than 
threatening a woman.  Violence against women is too real, and in 
other contexts courts have held to a standard of what a "reasonable 
woman" might fear.

BTW, does alt.sex.stories presume fiction, or is it pretend truth 
like the readers' sex stories in Penthouse?
