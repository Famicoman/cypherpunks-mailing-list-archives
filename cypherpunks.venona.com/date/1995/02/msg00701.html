Cypherpunks,

Q.  What do I mean, standards?

A.  A set of specifications that will allow encryption modules
    to be incorperated into receptacle encryption interface
    programs easily.

    The advantages of programs that comply with the CP standard
    might be illustrated with an example.

    Suppose Alice wants to use an interface program, say,
    GENPGP.EXE, to encrypt a message to Bob.

    Suppose that GENPGP is an interface encryption receptacle
    program that allows users to add and use their own encryption
    modules of choice.  If Alice were a command line freak, she
    could type:

        GENPGP -RSA_encrypt_the_session_key \
        -random_session_key_source ISA_Johnson_Noise_ADC \
        -chainsession \
        -blowfish -rounds 18 -keylength 2048 \
        -idea \
        -3descfb \
        -compress pkzip \
        -plain_text_file topsec.doc
        -receipient bob

    Or, suppose Alice is a GUI freak.  In this case she could
    use her entcrypt_lab schematic interface to design and save
    her encryption scheme for topsec.doc, and simply drop the
    icon for the doc into her block diagram's input icon.

    Bob, in either case, is still able to use his own program
    of choise, GNU_safe_mail, to automatically decrypt Alice's
    message to him, so long as Bob has incorperated all of the
    latest modules availible.

Q.  What are some advantages?

A.  There are numerous advantages.  Some programmers are good at
    writing user interfaces, and others are better at implementing
    algorithms.  Currently, many programmers of the second type
    make all sorts of encryption algorithms available, but these
    are not always easily understood by programmers of the first
    type, and more importantly, coded algorithms are not easily
    incorperated into existing programs.

    Another problem that may arise is that existing programs,
    and programs that may come out in the next year or two,
    may gain widespread use (e.g. PGP.EXE), but may at some
    time in the future become practically worthless, for
    example, if widely used interface programs rely on
    encryption algorithms that are discovered or perceived
    to be weak.

    If a standard such as the one I am proposing is released
    and gains acceptance, more programmers will comply, and
    this will allow the users of their interfaces to painlessly
    adapt the interface programs.  More importantly, such
    interface programs that make use of CP complient
    encryption modules will allow users to encrypt as
    insecurely or securely as their parinoia dictates.

    Also, as new encryption algorithms are invented and coded,
    hackers who like to optimize may take the extra step and
    make their code CP complient.  And command line Alice will
    be able to type:

        GENPGP -add_module BlowFish.mod

Q.  What are the disadvantages?

A.  At first blush, one disadvantage is options, like PGP's -m,
   (for your eyes only) are not practical for a standard such
   as the one I am proposing.  But then again, even using the
   command:

        PGP -em susan.doc

    is little more than a suggestion to the recepient of
    the letter to not keep the plaintext around.

Q.  Why should we?

A.  If we don't, IEEE or some other organization is
    bound to, and IEEE seems to be getting more politically
    correct as the years pass, and this doesn't seem to
    be compatible with the purpose of an encryption module
    standard.

    Consequently, I believe that such a task should be initiated
    and taken to completion by a renegade group such as the
    cypherpunks, by committe if possible, with the hopes that
    government moles will not weaken our effort.
