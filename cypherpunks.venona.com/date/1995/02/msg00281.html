The following is what Senator Exon's bill (S.314) would do to the 
Communicatons Act of 1934. The text in [brackets] is what is being 
deleted or changed. What exists as plain text outside those brackets is 
how the new law will look.

Read carefully. There are indeed implications for Internet service 
providers in terms of their responsibility under the law for the content 
of their systems and services.

   extent technically feasible, provide access to a communication
   specified in subsection (b) of this section from the [telephone]
   telecommunications device of any subscriber who has not previously 
   requested in writing the carrier to provide access to such 
   communication if the carrier collects from subscribers an identifiable 
   charge for such communication that the carrier remits, in whole or in 
   part, to the provider of such communication.
   
   (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), no cause of action may
   be brought in any court or administrative agency against any common
   carrier, or any of its affiliates, including their officers,

   faith to restrict access pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
   subsection; or
   
   (B) any access permitted -
   
   (i) in good faith reliance upon the lack of any
   representation by a provider of communications that
   communications provided by that provider are communications
   specified in subsection (b) of this section, or
   
   (ii) because a specific representation by the provider did
   not allow the carrier, acting in good faith, a sufficient
   period to restrict access to restrict access to communications
   described in subsection (b) of this section.
   
   (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a provider
   of communications services to which subscribers are denied access
   pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection may bring an action
   for a declaratory judgment or similar action in a court. Any such
   action shall be limited to the question of whether the
   communications which the provider seeks to provide fall within the
   category of communications to which the carrier will provide access
   only to subscribers who have previously requested such access.
