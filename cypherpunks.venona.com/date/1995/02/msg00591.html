&gt;But web of trust _in and of itself_
&gt;is not proving to be effective when applied to the problem of providing
&gt;reliable key certification on the scale of the internet as a whole. 

Here is something I posted on this topic last year:

&gt; From owner-cypherpunks@toad.com  Wed Mar 30 09:19:30 1994
&gt; Date: Wed, 30 Mar 1994 09:17:40 -0800
&gt; From: Hal &lt;hfinney@shell.portal.com&gt;
&gt; Message-Id: &lt;199403301717.JAA14861@jobe.shell.portal.com&gt;
&gt; To: cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt; Subject: Web of Trust?
&gt; Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt; Precedence: bulk
&gt; Status: RO
&gt; 
&gt; One of the key concepts widely used to describe PGP is the "web of trust".
&gt; This brings to mind a network of connections between people who know and
&gt; communicate with each other.  Two people who want to communicate can do
&gt; so securely if there is a path of connections in the form of signed keys
&gt; that joins them.
&gt; 
&gt; But this is not quite right.  The fundamental fact about PGP key signatures,
&gt; which is often misunderstood, is this:
&gt; 
&gt; You can only communicate securely with someone whose key is signed by a person
&gt; you know, either personally or by reputation.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, if I want to communicate with joe@abc.com, I can only do so
&gt; if one of the signators of his key is a person I know.  If not, I have no way
&gt; of judging the validity of his key.
&gt;  
&gt; This belies simple interpretations of the "web of trust".  I may have signed
&gt; A's key, A has signed B's, B has signed C's, C has signed D's, and D has signed
&gt; Joe's, but this is of no value unless I know D.  Only then can I trust Joe's
&gt; key.
&gt; 
&gt; This means that, in the "web" picture, I can only communicate securely with
&gt; people who are at most two hops away in the web of connections.  I can
&gt; communicate with the people I know, and I can communicate with the people they
&gt; know, and that is it.
&gt; 
&gt; This is unfortunate, because the simple web model ties into some famous
&gt; research which suggests that any two people chosen at random are only about
&gt; half a dozen steps apart in the web of who-knows-whom connections.  (This
&gt; result is where the title of the movie "Six Degrees of Separation" comes from.)
&gt; If you had a system which actually supported communications via such a web
&gt; model, it actually would have hope of letting two people communicate who did
&gt; not have a very long chain between them.  But PGP, with a maximum chain length
&gt; of two, will not allow this.
&gt; 
[Discussion of possible extensions elided]
&gt; 
&gt; Without this, I think we will continue to have problems with PGP being unable
&gt; to validate keys of people we want to communicate with.  People will collect
&gt; huge laundry lists of signatures in the hopes that whoever wants to commu-
&gt; nicate with them will know one of those people.  Centralized key validators
&gt; will appear (as in the case of the SLED service being started now, which will
&gt; sign a key based on a signed check with your name on it).  The result may be
&gt; a choice between using an unsigned key or using one signed by some faceless
&gt; bureaucracy, which is no better than the original PEM conception.
&gt; 
&gt; (People may be confused by this essay because they thought PGP worked this
&gt; way already.  PGP does have a follow-the-web model, but that is only for
&gt; following signatures.  In the example above, where I wanted to talk to Joe
&gt; and there was a chain to him through A, B, C, and D, we have to first sup-
&gt; pose that I know and trust all of A, B, C, and D.  Given that, what PGP can
&gt; do is to determine whether I have valid keys for all of those people.  It will
&gt; notice that A has signed B's key, so it is valid.  I know B and told PGP he
&gt; was trustworthy, and he signed C's key, so therefore that one is valid.  Sim-
&gt; ilarly, I know C and I know D so PGP can follow the chain through them.  Fin-
&gt; ally we come to Joe, whom I don't know, but because I know D and PGP followed
&gt; the web to determine that D's key is valid, PGP can determine that Joe's key
&gt; is valid.  But again, that was only because I knew D and everyone else in
&gt; the chain.  The bottom line is still that I can only communicate with people
&gt; who know someone I know.)
