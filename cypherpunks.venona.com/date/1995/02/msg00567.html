Linda does a good job but I frankly didn't believe this when I got it.
So I checked.  Unfortunately, this is true.

Herr Klinton has, by executive order, suspended part of the constitution 
which gives him his powers.  This is not logical, but if he has 
enough guys with guns backing him up, that doesn't matter.

Good luck to you all.  I may occasionally read my mail but from now
on my efforts are going to be focused on getting moved out of this 
hellhole before they "seal the borders." (another project of 
Janet Reno's)

Regards,
Brad Dolan

Please excuse any duplication to you.  I have not finished sorting out my
lists and only recently figured out the difference between individuals and
newsgroups (and have not yet gotten the names that are already in
newsgroups).  This was too important to wait on me to finish sorting.
