&gt; &gt;&gt;  If this is the file that the Co$ is trying to crack, then what the
&gt; &gt;&gt;  is being asked for is a pass phrase that can be handed to the Co$
&gt; &gt;&gt;  that will pass the PGP valid key check and still not decrypt the
&gt; &gt;&gt;  data to anything usefull.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, I don't have the PGP 'conventional' encryption format memorized, but  
&gt; &gt;there is probably a constant after the IV that is prepended to the data.  The  
&gt; &gt;constant is used to determine if the key is correct.  Since the conventional  
&gt; &gt;encryption runs in CFB mode and there is a full block of random IV at the  
&gt; &gt;beginning of the file, it is extremely unlikely that a key could be found  
&gt; &gt;that would properly decrypt only the first two blocks while leaving the rest  
&gt; &gt;unreadable...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  If Larry Wollersheim does have the valid key.  It would be a simpler
&gt; &gt;&gt;  process to know what fake key to use and work it backwards through
&gt; &gt;&gt;  the MD5 to arrive at an ascii string to produce the fake key.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not really.  Even if you could find an IDEA key that would produce the  
&gt; &gt;desired output it would be hard to find a passphrase that would produce that  
&gt; &gt;key when hashed.  One of the properties of one-way hash functions is that it  
&gt; &gt;is difficult to find a plaintext that produces a given hash.  Hence the term  
&gt; &gt;'one-way'....  Even if you did find a passphrase (which, if MD5 is strong,  
&gt; &gt;would require something like 2^64 operations), it would likely be long, have  
&gt; &gt;8-bit chars, and would be impossible to type in.  It would be tough to  
&gt; &gt;convince anyone that it was the real passphrase.

&gt; 
&gt; There was a hack to pgp ui published a while back that would allow
&gt; someone decrypting a RSA encrypted file to print out the idea key.
&gt; 
&gt; Another feature of the hack allowed someone with the idea key to decrypt
&gt; an RSA PGP encrypted file ignoring the RSA headers and using the IDEA
&gt; key directly.
&gt; 
&gt; Using this software should allow the reciever of an RSA PGP encrypted
&gt; file to allow someone else to decrypt it (by giving them the IDEA key)
&gt; without exposing the secret key. The IV block check will  allow them to
&gt; check that they are using the correct idea key.
&gt; 

Looking at the source code showes that all that is needed to
pass the PGP key check is for the first two blocks to decode
in such a way that the last 2 bytes of the IV match the 2
check bytes before the actual message. Thus the first 6 bytes
of the IV and the last 6 bytes of the next block need not
match the actual message.

There was a bug in the older versions of PGP that set the
IV to a constant instead of a random value when encrypting
with the "-c" option.

I made a mistake thinking that knowledge of the correct
key would help in creating a fake key.
