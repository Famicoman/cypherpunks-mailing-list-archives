&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;It was said that Pres. Clinton had given a speech while 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;visiting the  CIA HQ in Langley/Virginia. He allegedly 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;said in this speech that obtaining  industrial 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;informations has the highest priority and this were the 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;new  task for the spies.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. John Deutsch, speaking to the National Press Club, also mentioned
&gt; economic espionage, with the State Department as a primary
&gt; customer, but was concerned about definitions of goals, etc.
&gt; He did reassure the NPC that the CIA would continue to work with
&gt; drug dealers and corrupt South American military and other scum
&gt; who have information to sell, as well as cooperating more closely 
&gt; with the FBI and DEA, but on the other hand he does apparently
&gt; view domestic operations as clearly outside the CIA's job.
&gt; One set of content in his speech was the planned combination of
&gt; the various satellite data interpretation organizations
&gt; into one group of CIA/Pentagon/NRO/NSA/etc.


It's important here to distinguish economic "espionage" and economic
"intelligence."

Espionage refers to the stealing of secrets with humint, and genrally the
term economic espionage refers to the actual thefts as with the French
government stealing bids, and bag jobbing American businessmen.

Economic Intelligence is much older, and is more about economic analysis
on a macro scale of the target country.

I mention these because the doublespeak can trip up people who aren't
used to what the intelligence types are saying.

John Deutsch is definately an economic intelligence man, but has in past
been quite opposed to economic espionage.


&gt; 
&gt; ObCrypto: One questioner asked him about the growing use
&gt; of encoding and would the CIA be able to keep up eavesdropping on
&gt; people.  "We're very good at eavesdropping" was his main reply;
&gt; he did acknowledge that there was an issue but didn't go into 
&gt; the party line about needing to have escrow to get GAK.
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton, meanwhile, reassured guests at a $1000/plate fundraising 
&gt; lunch that the Republicans' economic plans would mainly affect
&gt; the poor and wouldn't trouble the rich too much...   :-)
