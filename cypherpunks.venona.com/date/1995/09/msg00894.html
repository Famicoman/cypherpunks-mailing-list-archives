&gt; &gt; Doesn't the practicality and accountability of a centralized authority 
&gt; &gt; (or several authorities) provide the best answer to this?  Who is going 
&gt; &gt; to accept my signature promising that I did indeed get a law degree and 
&gt; &gt; pass the bar?
&gt; 
&gt; An educational institution can certify its own graduates --- it does 
&gt; now.  Competing credentialing institutions is exactly what I would be 
&gt; looking for as opposed to today's coercive monoply.  
&gt; 
&gt; No matter how skilled, it is illegal for an unlicensed person to practice 
&gt; law, medicine, or many other professions in any state.  The nets weaken 
&gt; these restrictions because they allow action at a distance.
&gt;
That's certainly true.  But what about liability insurance?  That's one 
of the key aspects of my retention of a professional.  Being cynical, and 
somewhat knowledgable about human error, I want to be sure there's 
someone to turn to if the advice/treatment/whatever turns out not only to 
be wrong in hindsight, but in foresight.

Having taken, and passed, bar exams in three states (3 for 3 for those of 
you thinking I was forum shopping), I can tell you that they weren't that 
big of a barrier.  You can flunk (over several tries) by failing to 
prepare at all, panicking, being an extremely poor test taker, or, well ...
 
&gt; Note the other effects of the nets.  They make it hard to tell that you 
&gt; *are* working which reduces the impact of regulations of work by 
&gt; "illegal aliens."  Thus if I am wandering through the South of France 
&gt; while writing the 'Great American Novel' I am unlikely to get busted for 
&gt; violation of work restrictions.  The nets expand the number of jobs I 
&gt; can do while innocently wandering the South of France.  I can or will 
&gt; soon be able, for example, to manage a large international corporation 
&gt; from anywhere.

Just wondering about liability issues after state accrediting is dead.

Not a lawyer on the Net, although I play one in real life.
