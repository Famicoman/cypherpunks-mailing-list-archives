    *** About SAIC ***
     
_________________________________________________________________


   
                          "SAIC 25 YEARS OF PROGRESS"
                                       
   Founded by a small group of San Diego scientists in 1969, 
Science
   Applications International Corporation (SAIC) now ranks as 
the
   nation's largest employee-owned high-tech company. With 
annual
   revenues of $1.6 billion, SAIC has almost 4,000 employees in 
San
   Diego, and about 16,000 employees at more than 250 locations
   worldwide.
   
    SAIC offers broad expertise in technology development and 
analysis,
   computer system development and integration, technical 
support
   services, and computer hardware and software products. SAIC 
scientists
   and engineers work to solve complex technical problems in 
business
   areas that include environment, energy, health, 
transportation and
   space.
   
    Since the beginning, SAIC has been committed to making 
significant
   contributions to nationally important programs. Over the 
past two
   decades, SAIC technical staff have contributed to clean-up 
efforts at
   Three Mile Island and Prince William Sound, to the success 
of
   Operation Desert Storm, and to space missions ranging from 
Voyager to
   the shuttle flights. The company is helping develop new 
technology to
   clean up hazardous waste at Superfund sites, while other 
scientists
   are studying global climate and oceanographic changes. In 
another
   critical area, SAIC is increasing the quality of patient 
care while
   lowering costs by developing an automated patient record 
system for
   Department of Defense medical facilities.
   
    Today, SAIC generates about 90 percent of its business 
through
   federal government contracts, half of which are in the 
national
   security area. The company has been transitioning its 
extensive
   experience in advanced defense systems and software 
engineering to
   benefit civilian programs. For example, SAIC networking 
capability
   helps dozens of government agencies share information to 
fight drug
   smuggling, and integrates technology that has put a 
pollution-free bus
   on the road.
   
    Bob Beyster, SAIC's founder and chief executive officer, 
credits the
   success of the company to its employee ownership.
   
    "The hallmark of SAIC through the years has been the 
principle that
   those who contribute to the company should own it, with that 
ownership
   proportional to their contribution and performance as much 
as
   possible," Beyster says, "SAIC was designed for professional 
people
   who want to do superior scientific and technical work, who 
want to
   have a stake and a voice in the company's development and 
direction,
   and who expect fair rewards for doing excellent work."
