&gt;      MICROSOFT PUBLISHES SPECIFICATIONS DESIGNED TO HELP
&gt;      IMPROVE SECURITY ON THE INTERNET
&gt; 
&gt;     ATLANTA, Sept. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)
&gt; today announced the publication of two specifications that address key
&gt; Internet security issues.  Software designed with these specifications
&gt; will enable developers to incorporate improved security technology into
&gt; their applications, giving businesses and consumers confidence that
&gt; their transactions and communications will be secure.
&gt;     The two specifications -- Secure Transaction Technology (STT) and
&gt; Private Communication Technology (PCT) -- were published today on the
&gt; Internet.  To help encourage widespread adoption of STT and PCT,
&gt; Microsoft is making the specifications available at no charge to all
&gt; software developers, businesses, card brands and financial institutions
&gt; that want to create STT-compliant and PCT-compliant applications.  Both
&gt; can be found on the Microsoft home page (http//:www.microsoft.com).
&gt;     "We set out a year ago to build STT, a security system that meets
&gt; the strict requirements of the payment-card industry.  STT's design uses
&gt; sophisticated cryptographic techniques to help protect and authenticate
&gt; consumers, merchants and financial institutions that use bank cards to
&gt; conduct business on the Internet," said Craig Mundie, senior vice
&gt; president of the consumer systems division at Microsoft.  "After doing
&gt; so, we felt we could also apply our expertise to the Internet's need for
&gt; general-purpose security.  PCT builds upon Secure Sockets Layer by
&gt; incorporating strong authentication and other technologies we developed
&gt; for STT."
&gt;     STT, jointly developed with Visa International, is supported by the
&gt; Internet Shopping Network, RSA Data Security Inc. and Spyglass Inc.  The
&gt; PCT specification is supported by Cylink Corp., FTP Software Inc.,
&gt; Internet Shopping Network, NetManage Inc., OpenMarket Inc., Spyglass
&gt; Inc. and Starwave Corp.
&gt;     "We cannot afford to have doubt cast over the ability to conduct
&gt; business on the Internet," said Marc Miller, executive vice president of
&gt; marketing and business development for Spyglass Inc.  "We applaud
&gt; Microsoft for approaching the security issue as it should be approached
&gt; -- in an open forum within the Internet community.  Our whole business
&gt; model is based on partnerships.  We're happy to be working with
&gt; Microsoft to provide an open, specifications-based solution to help
&gt; ensure the viability of this exciting new medium."
&gt;     The Secure Transaction Technology specification, jointly developed
&gt; by Microsoft and Visa, is designed to provide a secure method for
&gt; handling credit-card transactions across private and public networks.
&gt; By providing a technology that can be completely integrated with the
&gt; current bank-card system, STT will serve as a reliable payment system
&gt; for software providers to incorporate into their products.  STT also
&gt; preserves the branded transaction relationships that merchants and
&gt; financial institutions have with their customers.
&gt;     The Private Communication Technology specification is designed to
&gt; secure general-purpose business and personal communications on the
&gt; Internet.  PCT includes features such as privacy, authentication and
&gt; mutual identification.  As a secure communications technology, PCT
&gt; builds on the earlier advances embodied in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
&gt; PCT enhances SSL by separating authentication from encryption.  This
&gt; means that PCT allows applications to use authentication that is
&gt; significantly stronger than the 40-bit key limit for encryption allowed
&gt; by the U.S. government for export.
&gt;     "The Internet Shopping Network is committed to providing the most
&gt; secure online shopping environment possible," said Boris Putanec, vice
&gt; president of engineering for the Internet Shopping Network.  "STT
&gt; delivers one of the highest levels of security and authentication for
&gt; shopping transactions, boosting electronic commerce."
&gt;     Microsoft plans to incorporate both STT and PCT into its own
&gt; products, such as the Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 2.0, which ships
&gt; with the Window(R) operating system, and is encouraging other software
&gt; developers to do the same.
&gt;     The specifications released by Microsoft include use of encryption
&gt; capabilities based on technology from RSA Data Security Inc.
&gt;     Founded in 1975, Microsoft is the worldwide leader in software for
&gt; personal computers.  The company offers a wide range of products and
&gt; services for business and personal use, each designed with the mission
&gt; of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of
&gt; the full power of personal computing every day.

&gt;     Microsoft is either a registered trademark or trademark in the
&gt; United States and/or other countries.
