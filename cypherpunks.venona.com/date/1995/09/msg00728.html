&gt;Subject: Whitehouse "dissident" web site monitoring?
&gt;
&gt;- ----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;      WHITE HOUSE MONITORING OF DISSIDENTS ON THE INTERNET
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    The  National  Security   Agency   presumably   can   monitor
&gt;subversive  communication  on  the  Internet  without leaving any
&gt;trace  by  "sniffing  packets"  at  traffic  nodes.  For   purely
&gt;political  purposes, however, the White House may be forced to do
&gt;the monitoring in-house,  which  means  that  they  leave  traces
&gt;everywhere they go.
&gt;
&gt;    With  just  a  superficial  search  for  such   traces,   The
&gt;Washington   Weekly   has   uncovered   intensive  monitoring  of
&gt;"dissident" Internet sites by the White House.
&gt;
&gt;    It turns out that computers from inside the White House  have
&gt;kept  pretty  good  tabs  on information available on Whitewater,
&gt;Vince Foster, and Mena at a few key repositories  on  the  World-
&gt;Wide Web, a subset of the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;    Just  three  such  sites:  "The   Washington   Weekly,   "The
&gt;Whitewater  Scandal  Home  Page" and "Whitewater &amp; Vince Foster,"
&gt;were accessed 128 times by  four  computers  from  the  Executive
&gt;Office  of the President between August 28 and August 31.  If the
&gt;White House is showing a similar interest in other sites  on  the
&gt;World  Wide  Web,  that would amount to a monitoring operation of
&gt;considerable magnitude. Tim Brady of the  Yahoo!  World-Wide  Web
&gt;index  says  that his company alone has indexed approximately 725
&gt;political  sites.  That  monitoring  effort  would  be   nothing,
&gt;however,  compared  to  the  effort  required to follow all anti-
&gt;Clinton discussion on the Usenet, another subset of the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;    The White House did  not  respond  to  an  inquiry  (attached
&gt;below)   asking  for  an  explanation  and  asking  whether  this
&gt;constituted "casual browsing."
&gt;
&gt;    Interestingly, the week after the  White  House  snooping  of
&gt;files,  which included a series of articles by J. Orlin Grabbe on
&gt;Vince Foster's ties  to  the  NSA,  the  following  little  piece
&gt;appeared in Newsweek Magazine:
&gt;
&gt;  "Conspiracy theorists perked up when Deborah Gorham told Senate
&gt;  Whitewater investigators in June that her boss, the late deputy
&gt;  White House counsel Vince Foster, asked her  to  put two secret
&gt;  notebooks  from  the  National Security Agency in a White House
&gt;  safe. The suggestion that  Foster  dealt  with  the NSA sparked
&gt;  feverish  speculation  on the  Internet that he was involved in
&gt;  espionage. The reality appears more prosaic.  The  White  House
&gt;  won't give details,  but  sources say Foster's files dealt with
&gt;  legal questions about national emergencies...."
====================================================

During the Waco Hearings, Charles Schumer said he'd seen Foster's missing
file and all it had in it was a memorandum about "Linda Thompson and THAT tape."

Now, put that with the "sources say Foster's files dealt with legal
questions bout national emergencies . . . ." and I will presume that "THAT
tape" and I constitute a "national emergency."

Harumph.

At any rate, we've (AEN News) had a number of military-based sniffs here.

================================================

&gt;    Does the White House follow anti-Clinton discussion on Usenet
&gt;newsgroups just as closely?  The White House posts press releases
&gt;to Usenet in collaboration with the Artificial  Intelligence  Lab
&gt;at   Massachusetts   Institute  of  Technology.  But  MIT  System
&gt;Administrator Bruce Walton says that the White House does not use
&gt;the  same  server  for  reading netnews.  It would be difficult -
&gt;although not impossible - to find the server that the White House
&gt;uses  for  reading  or  receiving netnews and check for traces on
&gt;that server.
&gt;
&gt;    Readers may be tempted to post a threat to the President on a
&gt;newsgroup just to see if they get a visit from the Secret Service
&gt;the next day. That experiment is not advisable. It is a  criminal
&gt;offense.  But  Usenet  just might be a faster conduit for getting
&gt;the attention of the administration than the email  address  that
&gt;the White House has published for the president.

&gt;Virginia M. Terzano
&gt;White House Office of the Press Secretary
&gt;The White House
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear Ms. Terzano:
&gt;
&gt;    It has come to my attention that several dissident  sites  on
&gt;the  World  Wide  Web  have been visited by White House computers
&gt;this week.  Apparently,  all  information  regarding  Whitewater,
&gt;Foster, and Mena has been transferred to White House computers.
&gt;
&gt;    Specifically, the sites,  
&gt;
&gt;"Washington Weekly" (<A  HREF="http://www.federal.com">http://www.federal.com</A>),  
&gt;"The Whitewater Scandal Home Page"
&gt;(<A  HREF="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~crow/whitewater/">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~crow/whitewater/</A>)
&gt;"Whitewater &amp; Vince Foster" 
&gt;(<A  HREF="http://www.cris.com/~dwheeler/n/whitewater/whitewater-index.html">http://www.cris.com/~dwheeler/n/whitewater/whitewater-index.html</A>)
&gt;
&gt;have  been  visited  by  White  House   computers   ist1.eop.gov,
&gt;ist6.eop.gov, ist7.eop.gov, and gatekeeper.eop.gov between August
&gt;28 and August 31, and a total of 128 files have been  transferred
&gt;to those White House computers. For all sites, this constitutes a
&gt;significant  increase  over  previous  access  by   White   House
&gt;computers.
&gt;
&gt;    In light of this information, I have the following questions:
&gt;
&gt;(1) Does this constitute "casual browsing" by White House staff, or
&gt;    is it, in light of the considerable time and effort spent during 
&gt;    regular business hours, part of a monitoring or intelligence operation?
&gt;
&gt;(2) For what purpose is the information transferred to the White House used?
&gt;
&gt;(3) Does the White House keep information from these web sites on file,
&gt;    and does the White House keep a file on the persons responsible for
&gt;    these web sites?
&gt;
&gt;(4) Is the April 9 statement by David Lytel of the White House Office of
&gt;    Science and Technology to Amy Bauer of Copley News Service that the
&gt;    administration does not monitor anti-Clinton activity on the web still
&gt;    operative?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;Marvin Lee
