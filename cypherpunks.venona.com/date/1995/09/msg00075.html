I want to update the general list on how well our "Cypherpunks Santa Cruz"
party/meeting went last Saturday.

Apologies to those who get this twice, as I just sent it out to the folks
on the mailing list of interested folks I keep. (Not all of them are
readers of this list, so....)

It was a great success, from all indications, and we'll be doing it on a
regular basis. "Meet locally, communicate globally."

&gt;Subject: Cypherpunks Santa Cruz -- Great Party!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is a report on the Cypherpunks Santa Cruz party/meeting held last
&gt;Saturday at my house. For those of you on this list (52 at last count,
&gt;obviously not all locals) who missed it, it was considered by many who
&gt;commented to me to be a great success.
&gt;
&gt;Some highlights:
&gt;
&gt;- I counted 23 attendees, from as far away as Oregon (Greg Broiles) and San
&gt;Luis Obispo (Jeff Simmons), and with a bunch of folks from Marin and the
&gt;Greater Bay Area.
&gt;
&gt;- We got rolling around 5, when the first cars started filling up my
&gt;parking area. Things kept going 'til 5 in the morning (!), when the last
&gt;stragglers departed and those staying the night found their futons and
&gt;crashed.
&gt;
&gt;- Not too much was formally done. We had a round of introductions (and I
&gt;provided name tags, which were purely voluntary, in that anyone could
&gt;volunteer not to wear them and hence not be remembered by others...most
&gt;wore them). Later, after the barbecue, Bob Fleming and Cherie Kushner
&gt;described their work on micropower, ultrawideband radio "localizers." While
&gt;not strictly "crypto" related, there are overlapping themes (privacy,
&gt;surveillance, and even some of the math overlaps).
&gt;
&gt;- Mostly it was a chance for our local community of folks interested in
&gt;these issues to mingle and make contact. I expect we may have a larger
&gt;focus than just "crypto" (although Cypherpunks have always had a larger
&gt;focus than just cryptography, of course). Especially as there are folks
&gt;doing some neat stuff on the Web out here in Santa Cruz.
&gt;
&gt;- Two folks from my local ISP attended (Jay and Marc), and they have some
&gt;thoughts on possibly hosting the Cypherpunks archive site on their system,
&gt;and other ideas. They stayed until nearly 5 a.m., talking with us about
&gt;networking, Web pages, etc.
&gt;
&gt;(Santa Cruz has long been a hotbed of computer activity, especially of the
&gt;more independent sort. So the good turnout from local folks could be very
&gt;promising for Cypherpunks themes. Interestingly, Linus Torvaldis (sp?), of
&gt;Linux fame, had just been in town a couple of days before.)
&gt;
&gt;I want to avoid opening the meeting up too broadly, to, for example "anyone
&gt;interested in computers," as this would produce unpredictable turnouts and
&gt;lots of folks who want to learn to use Windows, or need help in dBase, etc.
&gt;Better to keep an ostensible focus on "Cypherpunks" themes, with forays
&gt;into related areas.
&gt;
&gt;Some people commented to me that they hope the meetings/parties are
&gt;monthly, but I suspect every other month may be more reasonable...after
&gt;all, a monthly meeting would mean another one only 3 weeks from today, and
&gt;I can't see this happening.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I expect to announce another one for sometime in October. I also
&gt;may be having a "PenSFA" party at my place in early November (11/11 is
&gt;being considered), and may merge the two. It's a good opportunity for
&gt;mingling.
&gt;
&gt;Another attendee offered the possibility of having a Cypherpunks Santa Cruz
&gt;meeting/party at her house, so some rotation to other venues may start to
&gt;happen. I think the notion of having these things at private houses is
&gt;better than trying to get space at a local company, for example. Parties in
&gt;houses are more intimate, less formal, and don't require the "corporate
&gt;approvals" that are sometimes needed. Besides, I'm offering my house and
&gt;have no contacts at local companies.
&gt;
&gt;I expect to be able to host a lot of these things, and if some others
&gt;volunteer as well, we'll be set. (I expect attendance will not equal the 23
&gt;at this "first" meeting, for obvious reasons. This means meetings/parties
&gt;could even be held in apartments or condos. But I'm not suggesting this,
&gt;only noting it.)
&gt;
&gt;So, thanks for coming!
&gt;
