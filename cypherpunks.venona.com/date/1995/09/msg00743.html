&gt; 
&gt;       WHITE HOUSE MONITORING OF DISSIDENTS ON THE INTERNET
&gt;       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!!!

Unbelievable!!!  To add to this distressing truth, I have learned that 
the White House also subscribes to a number of newspapers and periodicals 
which are reviewed for things of interest to the Administration and to 
the President. I I I I I I ammmmmmmmmm shocked!


Ooops.  Dog bites man.
And do you really think the White House couldn't hire a couple of net 
gurus to sniff packets if they wanted to hide their "monitoring"(=reading).

EBD
 
&gt; 
&gt;     The  National  Security   Agency   presumably   can   monitor
&gt; subversive  communication  on  the  Internet  without leaving any
&gt; trace  by  "sniffing  packets"  at  traffic  nodes.  For   purely
&gt; political  purposes, however, the White House may be forced to do
&gt; the monitoring in-house,  which  means  that  they  leave  traces
&gt; everywhere they go.
&gt; 
&gt;     With  just  a  superficial  search  for  such   traces,   The
&gt; Washington   Weekly   has   uncovered   intensive  monitoring  of
&gt; "dissident" Internet sites by the White House.
&gt; 
&gt;     It turns out that computers from inside the White House  have
&gt; kept  pretty  good  tabs  on information available on Whitewater,
&gt; Vince Foster, and Mena at a few key repositories  on  the  World-
&gt; Wide Web, a subset of the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;     Just  three  such  sites:  "The   Washington   Weekly,   "The
&gt; Whitewater  Scandal  Home  Page" and "Whitewater &amp; Vince Foster,"
&gt; were accessed 128 times by  four  computers  from  the  Executive
&gt; Office  of the President between August 28 and August 31.  If the
&gt; White House is showing a similar interest in other sites  on  the
&gt; World  Wide  Web,  that would amount to a monitoring operation of
&gt; considerable magnitude. Tim Brady of the  Yahoo!  World-Wide  Web
&gt; index  says  that his company alone has indexed approximately 725
&gt; political  sites.  That  monitoring  effort  would  be   nothing,
&gt; however,  compared  to  the  effort  required to follow all anti-
&gt; Clinton discussion on the Usenet, another subset of the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;     The White House did  not  respond  to  an  inquiry  (attached
&gt; below)   asking  for  an  explanation  and  asking  whether  this
&gt; constituted "casual browsing."
&gt; 
&gt;     Interestingly, the week after the  White  House  snooping  of
&gt; files,  which included a series of articles by J. Orlin Grabbe on
&gt; Vince Foster's ties  to  the  NSA,  the  following  little  piece
&gt; appeared in Newsweek Magazine:
&gt; 
&gt;   "Conspiracy theorists perked up when Deborah Gorham told Senate
&gt;   Whitewater investigators in June that her boss, the late deputy
&gt;   White House counsel Vince Foster, asked her  to  put two secret
&gt;   notebooks  from  the  National Security Agency in a White House
&gt;   safe. The suggestion that  Foster  dealt  with  the NSA sparked
&gt;   feverish  speculation  on the  Internet that he was involved in
&gt;   espionage. The reality appears more prosaic.  The  White  House
&gt;   won't give details,  but  sources say Foster's files dealt with
&gt;   legal questions about national emergencies...."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     Does the White House follow anti-Clinton discussion on Usenet
&gt; newsgroups just as closely?  The White House posts press releases
&gt; to Usenet in collaboration with the Artificial  Intelligence  Lab
&gt; at   Massachusetts   Institute  of  Technology.  But  MIT  System
&gt; Administrator Bruce Walton says that the White House does not use
&gt; the  same  server  for  reading netnews.  It would be difficult -
&gt; although not impossible - to find the server that the White House
&gt; uses  for  reading  or  receiving netnews and check for traces on
&gt; that server.
&gt; 
&gt;     Readers may be tempted to post a threat to the President on a
&gt; newsgroup just to see if they get a visit from the Secret Service
&gt; the next day. That experiment is not advisable. It is a  criminal
&gt; offense.  But  Usenet  just might be a faster conduit for getting
&gt; the attention of the administration than the email  address  that
&gt; the White House has published for the president.

&gt; 
&gt; Virginia M. Terzano
&gt; White House Office of the Press Secretary
&gt; The White House
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Ms. Terzano:
&gt; 
&gt;     It has come to my attention that several dissident  sites  on
&gt; the  World  Wide  Web  have been visited by White House computers
&gt; this week.  Apparently,  all  information  regarding  Whitewater,
&gt; Foster, and Mena has been transferred to White House computers.
&gt; 
&gt;     Specifically, the sites,  
&gt; 
&gt; "Washington Weekly" (<A  HREF="http://www.federal.com">http://www.federal.com</A>),  
&gt; "The Whitewater Scandal Home Page"
&gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~crow/whitewater/">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~crow/whitewater/</A>)
&gt; "Whitewater &amp; Vince Foster" 
&gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.cris.com/~dwheeler/n/whitewater/whitewater-index.html">http://www.cris.com/~dwheeler/n/whitewater/whitewater-index.html</A>)
&gt; 
&gt; have  been  visited  by  White  House   computers   ist1.eop.gov,
&gt; ist6.eop.gov, ist7.eop.gov, and gatekeeper.eop.gov between August
&gt; 28 and August 31, and a total of 128 files have been  transferred
&gt; to those White House computers. For all sites, this constitutes a
&gt; significant  increase  over  previous  access  by   White   House
&gt; computers.
&gt; 
&gt;     In light of this information, I have the following questions:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Does this constitute "casual browsing" by White House staff, or
&gt;     is it, in light of the considerable time and effort spent during 
&gt;     regular business hours, part of a monitoring or intelligence operation?
&gt; 
&gt; (2) For what purpose is the information transferred to the White House used?
&gt; 
&gt; (3) Does the White House keep information from these web sites on file,
&gt;     and does the White House keep a file on the persons responsible for
&gt;     these web sites?
&gt; 
&gt; (4) Is the April 9 statement by David Lytel of the White House Office of
&gt;     Science and Technology to Amy Bauer of Copley News Service that the
&gt;     administration does not monitor anti-Clinton activity on the web still
&gt;     operative?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt; Marvin Lee
