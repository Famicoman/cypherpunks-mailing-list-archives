My homepage has not got that many links, but it is fairly well known.
I would be happy to set up a WWW page just for you. How about:
<A  HREF="http://obscura.com/~t-shirt/">http://obscura.com/~t-shirt/</A>

This will be around for quite a while, since I am getting into the ISP biz, and
obscura is my domain.

&gt;On the subject of the UK printing of the muntions T-shirt, I've got a
&gt;problem, I would like to put a URL for how to obtain the T-shirts, and
&gt;cypherpunk political material, anti ITAR, clipper etc, bu yet I can't
&gt;very well put my URL:
&gt;
&gt;        <A  HREF="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/">http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/</A>
&gt;
&gt;because that may possibly move within a year, maybe sooner, and
&gt;T-shirts are so permanent :-(
&gt;
&gt;It seems like too good an opportunity to miss, as some people may get
&gt;the thing nice publicity, and interest in the cypherpunks take on
&gt;encryption, so it would be ideal to have an on-line reference on the
&gt;shirt.
&gt;
&gt;So what I was thinking is it would be nice if someone with a permanent
&gt;URL, could put a pointer to my URL, that could be updated later, as my
&gt;URL moves?
&gt;
&gt;A cypherpunks page which has been and will be around for a *long time*
&gt;with lots of info or pointers to info on ITAR, the evils of key escrow
&gt;etc would be ideal.
&gt;
&gt;I don't need the WWW space for the actual info as such, just a pointer
&gt;which can point to where-ever it is my URL moves to, and as most
&gt;cpunks URLs seem to be in the US, it wouldn't be a v good idea to put
&gt;my content on a US server anyway (arguably).
&gt;
&gt;Any offers?
&gt;
&gt;Also now I'm here, there were a few people on the list who ordered
&gt;shirts from me, and the progress has been slow, if you want to see the
&gt;reasons, and up-to-date state of progress, take a look at:
&gt;
&gt;        <A  HREF="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/uk-shirt.html">http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/uk-shirt.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;I need to decide soon as to what URL to print, I was otherwise
&gt;thinking of removing the URL, as my sys admin made some strange
&gt;cryptic comment about me not having my URL after a while anyway (when
&gt;I finish the course, pointed comment? who knows), and I thought it
&gt;might not go down to well if I printed my URL on the T-shirt, at least
&gt;if it's an indirect pointer I have the option to get alternate WWW
&gt;space.
&gt;
&gt;I have decided to switch printers as the last guy seems to have
&gt;vanished, no answers to messages on answer phone for &gt; 1 week, and
&gt;some shirt printers (like the new one I've chosen) offer to the whole
&gt;job in a week, and people are getting impatient for their shirts.  So
&gt;I ideally need a commitment of a URL so that I can modify the design &amp;
&gt;send of to this new printers tonight.
&gt;
&gt;The main criteria, apart from a nice selection of links (I've got ITAR
&gt;and cpunk links allready anyway) is that the URL pointing at my roving
&gt;URL is going to stay there for a few years, at least.
