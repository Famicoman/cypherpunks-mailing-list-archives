[...]
&gt;There may be ECPA issues involved, especially if CalPolySLO is a government-

[...]

I think the ECPA should apply to private universities, too. The
FERPA also applies to virutally all U.S. private universities.

q: Can (should) my university monitor my email?

a: Ethically (and perhaps legally) email communications should have
the same privacy protection as telephone calls. It would be unwise for
any university employee to tap email communications without
authorization from the university president, university legal counsel,
and the academic freedom committee. According to Mike Godwin, legal
services counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the
U.S.'s Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) could be
reasonably construed to protect university email. This is also the
reported opinion of the U. of Michigan's lawers. Also, the U.S.'s
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act gives students at all public
and most private schools some privacy rights.

A U.S. government task force says that "[Email] monitoring [of
government employees] of actual communications and communicators may
impinge on the Constitutional rights of freedom of speech (1st
Amendment), against unreasonable search and seizure (4th Amendment),
and against self-incrimination (5th amendment), as well as on the
right to privacy, specifically as set forth in both the Privacy Act
and the ECPA."

In the context of libraries, the American Library Association's Policy
on Confidentiality of Library Records suggests this procedure to deal
with an official or police request for information about users:

'When drafting local policies, libraries should consult with their
legal counsel to insure these policies are based upon and
consistent with applicable federal, state, and local law
concerning the confidentiality of library records, the disclosure
of public records, and the protection of individual privacy.

Suggested procedures include the following:

     1.  The library staff member receiving the request to
         examine or obtain information relating to circulation or
         other records identifying the names of library users,
         will immediately refer the person making the request to
         the responsible officer of the institution, who shall
         explain the confidentiality policy.

     2.  The director, upon receipt of such process, order, or
         subpoena, shall consult with the appropriate legal
         officer assigned to the institution to determine if such
         process, order, or subpoena is in good form and if there
         is a showing of good cause for its issuance.

     3.  If the process, order, or subpoena is not in proper form
         or if good cause has not been shown, insistence shall be
         made that such defects be cured before any records are
         released. (The legal process requiring the production
         of circulation or other library records shall ordinarily
         be in the form of subpoena "duces tecum" [bring your
         records] requiring the responsible officer to attend
         court or the taking of his/her deposition and may
         require him/her to bring along certain designated
         circulation or other specified records.)

     4.  Any threats or unauthorized demands (i.e., those not
         supported by a process, order, or subpoena) concerning
         circulation and other records identifying the names of
         library users shall be reported to the appropriate legal
         officer of the institution.

     5.  Any problems relating to the privacy of circulation and
         other records identifying the names of library users
         which are not provided for above shall be referred to
         the responsible officer.'

* Expression -- Hate Speech -- UWM Post v. U Of Wisconsin

The full text of UWM POST v. U. of Wisconsin. This recent district
court ruling goes into detail about the difference between protected
offensive expression and illegal harassment. It even mentions email.

It concludes: "The founding fathers of this nation produced a
remarkable document in the Constitution but it was ratified only with
the promise of the Bill of Rights.  The First Amendment is central to
our concept of freedom.  The God-given "unalienable rights" that the
infant nation rallied to in the Declaration of Independence can be
preserved only if their application is rigorously analyzed.

The problems of bigotry and discrimination sought to be addressed here
are real and truly corrosive of the educational environment.  But
freedom of speech is almost absolute in our land and the only
restriction the fighting words doctrine can abide is that based on the
fear of violent reaction.  Content-based prohibitions such as that in
the UW Rule, however well intended, simply cannot survive the
screening which our Constitution demands."
