The general opinion seems to be that the netnews format is very
convenient, though we should keep the list; but that entering Usenet or
Altnet would lower the S/N.

Why not, then, start a new hierarchy?  Why not gate cypherpunks not to
alt.cypherpunks or comp.security.cypherpunks, but to crypto.cypherpunks?
We could feed it freely between us and set up NNTP servers which are
open for just crypto.*.  c.c would be the only crypto.* group for now,
but it would also be easy to add more -- say, for the "respectable"
splinter group, or for protocol WGs.  We'd get the convenience of netnews
without the high profile.

I'm willing to run the gateway on news.tembel.org and feed other sites,
if people think crypto.cypherpunks is a good idea.  Opinions?
