&gt; OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
&gt; Washington, DC  20510
&gt; *
&gt; 
&gt; *
&gt; ISSUE UPDATE ON INFORMATION SECURITY AND
&gt; PRIVACY IN NETWORK ENVIRONMENTS
&gt; *
&gt; 
&gt; The OTA background paper "Issue Update on Information
&gt; Security and Privacy in Network Environments" is now
&gt; available.  Ordering information and details about
&gt; electronic access are at the end of this file.
&gt; 
&gt; INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES IN NETWORK
&gt; ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL ATTENTION
&gt; 
&gt; Transition to a society that depends on electronic
&gt; information and network connectivity brings new concerns for
&gt; information security and effective protection of privacy.
&gt; The new focus must be on safeguarding information as it is
&gt; processed, stored, and transmitted, rather than on
&gt; "document" security or "computer" security.  In the
&gt; networked society, responsibility for information security
&gt; is shifting to the end users.
&gt; 
&gt; In a background paper released today the congressional
&gt; Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) finds an increasingly
&gt; urgent need for timely congressional attention to these
&gt; concerns.
&gt; 
&gt; OTA has updated, at the request of the Senate Committee on
&gt; Governmental Affairs, some key issues identified in its 1994
&gt; report on information security and privacy.  OTA found that
&gt; recent and ongoing events are relevant to congressional
&gt; consideration of national cryptography policy and
&gt; government-wide guidance on safeguarding unclassified
&gt; information in federal agencies.
&gt; 
&gt; OTA stresses the need for openness, oversight, and public
&gt; accountability--given the broad public and business impacts
&gt; of these policies--throughout the discussion of possible
&gt; congressional actions.  In OTA's view, two key questions
&gt; underlie consideration of policy options.  The first is: How
&gt; will the nation develop and maintain the balance among
&gt; traditional "national security" and law-enforcement
&gt; objectives and other aspects of the public interest, such as
&gt; economic vitality, civil liberties, and open government?
&gt; The second is: What are the costs of government efforts to
&gt; control cryptography and who will bear them?
&gt; 
&gt; None of the cost estimates will be easy to make, warns OTA.
&gt; Ultimately, however, these costs are all borne by the
&gt; public, whether in the form of taxes, product prices, or
&gt; foregone economic opportunities and earnings.
&gt; 
&gt; OTA emphasizes that congressional oversight of government
&gt; information security and privacy protection is of utmost
&gt; importance in the present time of government reform and
&gt; organizational streamlining.  The security of unclassified
&gt; information has not been a top management priority;
&gt; downsizing can incur additional information security and
&gt; privacy risks.  Similarly, says OTA, management must ensure
&gt; integration of safeguards when streamlining agency
&gt; operations and modernizing information systems
&gt; 
&gt; OTA finds momentum building for government-wide consolidation
&gt; of information-security responsibilities.  Congress must
&gt; resolve the overarching issue of where federal authority for
&gt; safeguarding unclassified information in the civilian
&gt; agencies should reside and, therefore, what needs
&gt; to be done concerning the substance and implementation of
&gt; the Computer Security Act of 1987, says OTA.  If Congress retains the
&gt; general premise of the act--that responsibility for
&gt; unclassified information security in the civilian agencies
&gt; should not reside within the defense/intelligence
&gt; community--then vigilant oversight and clear direction will
&gt; be needed, says OTA.
&gt; 
&gt; Timely and continuing congressional oversight of
&gt; cryptography policies is crucial, says OTA.  Cryptography, a
&gt; fundamental safeguard, can preserve the confidentiality of
&gt; messages and files, or provide "digital signatures" that
&gt; will help speed the way to electronic commerce.  Non-
&gt; governmental markets for cryptography-based safeguards have
&gt; grown over the past two decades, but are still developing.
&gt; Research is international; markets would be, says OTA,
&gt; except for governmental restrictions, such as export
&gt; controls that effectively create "domestic" and "export"
&gt; market segments for strong encryption products.
&gt; 
&gt; Cryptography policies affect technological developments in
&gt; the field, as well as the health and economic vitality of
&gt; companies that produce or use products incorporating
&gt; cryptography, and consequently, the vitality of the
&gt; information technology industries and the everyday lives of
&gt; most Americans.  But, business has strong and serious
&gt; concerns that government interests, especially with respect
&gt; to standards and export controls, could stifle commercial
&gt; development and use of networks in the international arena.
&gt; Given the broad public and business impacts, timely and
&gt; continuing congressional oversight of these policies is
&gt; crucial.
&gt; 
&gt; Strong encryption is increasingly portrayed as a threat to
&gt; domestic security (public safety) and a barrier to law
&gt; enforcement if it is readily available for use by terrorists
&gt; or criminals.  Thus, export controls, intended to restrict
&gt; the international availability of U.S. cryptography
&gt; technology and products, are now being joined with domestic
&gt; cryptography initiatives, like key-escrow encryption, that
&gt; are intended to preserve U.S. law-enforcement and signals-
&gt; intelligence capabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; Public and business concerns surrounding the Clinton
&gt; Administration's escrowed-encryption initiative have not
&gt; been resolved, notes OTA.  Many concerns focus on whether
&gt; government-approved, key-escrow encryption will become
&gt; mandatory for government agencies or the private sector, if
&gt; non-escrowed encryption will be banned, and/or if  these
&gt; actions could be taken without legislation. Although the
&gt; Clinton Administration has stated that it has no plans to
&gt; make escrowed encryption mandatory, or to ban other forms of
&gt; encryption, OTA points out that, absent legislation, these
&gt; intentions are not binding.  OTA concludes that escrowed-
&gt; encryption initiatives warrant congressional attention
&gt; because of the public funds that will be spent in deploying
&gt; them, and also because negative public perceptions of the
&gt; processes for developing and deploying encryption standards,
&gt; and of the standards themselves, may erode public confidence
&gt; and trust in government and the effectiveness of federal
&gt; leadership in promoting responsible use of information
&gt; safeguards.
&gt; 
&gt; OTA is a nonpartisan analytical agency that serves the U.S.
&gt; Congress.  Its purpose is to aid Congress with the complex
&gt; and often highly technical issues that increasingly affect
&gt; our society.
