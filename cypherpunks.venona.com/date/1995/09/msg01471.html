I don't think I've seen this here (but it was on a bunch of security
newsgoups...)

Forwarded message:
&gt; 
&gt; According to an article in `Communications Week International', the
&gt; 34-nation Council of Europe has agreed to outlaw strong encryption
&gt; products which do not make keys available to governments.
&gt; 
&gt; The article, `Euro-Clipper chip scheme proposed', is on the front page
&gt; of the magazine's issue 151, dated 18th September, which arrived in my
&gt; mail this morning.
&gt; 
&gt; It relates that the policy was approved on the 8th September at
&gt; Strasbourg by the Council, and coincides with an attempt by the
&gt; European Commission to propose a pan-European encryption standard. The
&gt; Council - unlike the Commission - has no statutory powers to enforce
&gt; its recommendations. However, Peter Csonka, the chairman of the
&gt; committee that drafted the document (and an administrative officer at
&gt; the Council's division of crime problems) says that `it is rare for
&gt; countries to reject Council of Europe recommendations'.
&gt; 
&gt; The proposal would make telecomms operators responsible for decrypting
&gt; traffic and supplying it to governments when asked.  It would also
&gt; `change national laws to enable judicial authorities to chase hackers
&gt; across borders'.
&gt; 
&gt; Opposition to this measure was expressed by Mike Strezbek, VP
&gt; responsible for European telecomms at JP Morgan, who said that his
&gt; organisation `will challenge any attempt to limit the power of our
&gt; network encryption technologies very strongly'.
&gt; 
&gt; Czonka said that the Council had given consideration to business
&gt; interests but had tries to strike a balance between privacy and
&gt; justice. However, `it remains possible that cryptography is available
&gt; to the public which cannot be deciphered,' his document says. `This
&gt; might lead to the conclusion to put restrictions on the possession,
&gt; distribution, or use of cryptography.'
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently another international organisation, the OECD, has called a
&gt; conference of its members in December to devise a strategy on
&gt; encryption.
&gt; 
&gt; I for one will be making clear to my MP that his stand on this issue
&gt; will determine how I cast my ballot at the next election. I note that
&gt; John Major stated in a 1994 parliamentary written reply to David Shaw
&gt; MP that the government did not intend to legislate on data encryption.
&gt; I am disppointed that government policy has changed to the point of
&gt; supporting the Council of Europe, and that this change has sneaked 
&gt; through during the parliamentary recess.
