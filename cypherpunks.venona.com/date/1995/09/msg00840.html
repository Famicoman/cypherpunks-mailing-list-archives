&gt;&gt;But is this even possible, to make a GAK system "not interoperable" with,
&gt;&gt;  say, PGP?
&gt;&gt;   Unless the GAK system has some sort of entropy analyzer, and can
&gt;&gt;  recognize high-entropy sources which it presumes to be encrypted data
&gt;&gt;  (*), one can of course PGP-encrypt a text file and then GAK the
&gt;&gt; resulting file.
&gt;
&gt; I took it to mean that they were saying that an approved program on one
&gt; end of a communication exchange could not exchange encrypted messages or
&gt; established an encrypted session of some kind with an un approved program
&gt; on the other end.  Not trying to outlaw superencryption (PGP on both ends
&gt; using a GAKed channel) but GAK on one end working with an unapproved
&gt; system on the other end.  A ringer GAK-work-alike that would defeat the
&gt; intent of GAK.
&gt; I don't know if the government can prevent that with a software-only
&gt; system or indeed if half a secure system can be made completely secure.

The breakout session that I was in was directly charged with this issue.
We talked at length about it. There were NIS&amp;T and NSA folks at the session.
The consensus was that the Government wanted to prevent a version of PGP
that was export enabled (GAK and short keys) that would be backward
compatible.

The group stated strongly that this was a "non starter." That is,
it was unacceptable. Vendors wanted "sales appeal." That means
compatibility with existing software. And compatibility with existing
export-approved systems. [DES has been exported to "friendly" countries
with strict controls.]

And criteria #2 specifically outlawed superencryption.
No DES | TRAN | DES | TRAN | DES.
They were serious. talk to CME, he was in that session.

I believe that this criteria is stupid, or at least ill-advised.
But the govies insisted.

All the more justification to ignore the US rules and develop
off-shore.
