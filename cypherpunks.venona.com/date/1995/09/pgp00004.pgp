I think it *tremendously* disturbing that the F.B.I. suddenly thinks 
itself part of the Legislative branch, able to make law and dictate 
policy to the rest of the country.

In fact there is a plague of this kind of thing, law making in the wrong 
channels, as if the executive agencies in the United States were suddenly 
able to implement their own law.

I think the F.B.I. needs to act like the Executive agency it is, advice 
the president, and then generally shut up.

Even more disturbing, and more revealing I think, was Freeh's comment
in the same NYT article, that the FBI "would not tolerate" civilian
cryptography if it interfered with the FBI's "public-safety mission"
- -- and this in a nation where, according to surveys, approximately 80%
of the population opposes such controls!

Where does Freeh's arrogance come from?  Just a couple of years ago,
Digital Telephony was laughed out of Congress; then suddenly, not a
soul in Congress dared oppose it.  I think we need to take a real hard
look at what the U.S. intelligence community is becoming, and how it
is able to throw its weight around so effectively.

According to a recent article on Freeh in "George" (John Kennedy Jr's
new political magazine), the FBI currently has more funding, and is
becoming more internationalized, than the CIA.  And while I don't have
the research resources to make a hard argument, I am getting a strong
impression from recent events that the international intelligence
community is becoming a rogue entity, with enormous independent
powers, whose member agencies increasingly flaunt their diminishing
loyalty and accountability to any nation or government.

If that is true, if my take on this contains even a grain of truth,
then we are facing a crisis of staggering proportions.  The outcome
may determine the worldwide viability of meaningful self-government.
