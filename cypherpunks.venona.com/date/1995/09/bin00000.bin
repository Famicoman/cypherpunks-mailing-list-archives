Nice idea. How'bout simplifying it: use (IDEA or whatever) as a secure PRNG
which generates PRNG settings. Make a table of PRNG's (to make sure that 
you only use `good' PRNG's), and let IDEA generate index number,
seed, length (8 bits of index number, 32 bits of seed, 10 bits of length, 
for example. Make that two PRNG's, so you'd need 100 bits from the secure
PRNG in order to get the pad for the next (say) 256 - 1024 bytes. This might
be a large performance gain. 

I just wonder how secure it is. Schneier (p 349) says all LCG's (which will
give the best performance) have been broken, but does not indicate how
many bits from a LCG are neccesary to break it. But we can always let 
sci.crypt decide about that :-).
