| &gt; Of course you have to be very careful, as you say. Did you see my
| &gt; problem-section in the original letter? I included it above.
| ... [the referenced section elided by jirib] ...
| 
| If I only ever give out a hash of my seed, and only ever *add* any received
| info to my seed (and stir it in well), how can anyone find out anything?
| (Apart from hash weaknesses.)

Giving out contribution: 
     MD5(select_bits(my_seed, start_bit, stop_bit)) -&gt; remote
Taking in contribution : 
     my_seed = my_seed XOR 
     ((select_low_bits(remote_contrib, contrib_width) &lt;&lt; contrib_area)

You also need to keep track of who has contributed what, and how much.
This might become a problem if you don't have a safe authentification
mechanism, like baseing the tracking on the IP-numbers etc.

But I don't believe this is a real problem, since you always
contribute 'entropy', not exact values. You need to know the exact
state of the random generator to be able to predict how your
contribution will affect the generator.

The boot-strap stage is actually the big problem still. But if the
initial stages are 'random enough' to withstand a total crack, I guess
the randomness gathered will increase rapidly, and increase the
safety a lot.

| The only thing that remains is that I cannot really count on a stranger
| to actually give me something truly random. In fact, since at least
| one other person knows it, I shouldn't count any entropy from it at all.
|
| However, if I get e bits from each of n servers, and k of them are rogue,
| then I have e*(n-k) bits, ie e*n*(1-k/n). With a suitably conservative
| estimate of k/n, this should be acceptable.
| 
| In any case, accepting donations of entropy cannot possibly reduce the
| amount of entropy I have, can it?

This isn't a problem as I see it, he'll only know what bits he
flipped, not the actual state.

I guess someone could mount an attack on the remote_contrib, finding
the part of my_seed by bruting the remote_contrib that I submitted.
But even if that is done, you'll only know a small part of the total
seed. And the remote end can't choose which segment of my_seed that
will be revealed.

I also see a problem if an attacker is controlling the whole
environment, but this is no different from the original problem, and
a lot more unlikely.

| &gt; and that you should only give out approximately the same amount of 
| &gt; randomness to the neighbour, as you point out below.
| ...
| 
| I'm not sure I follow this one. Why?
| 
| If the neighbour is willing to trust me for more, and cannot possibly
| deduce my seed from the numbers ('cause it's a strong 1-way hash),
| the only thing it costs me is CPU time - it'd cost me more to keep
| track of who asked for how much when.

Well, the reason would be that if someone bruted your contribution,
they would still have to guess the remaining part. Double safe! :-)

| ...
| &gt; My approach solves part of the problem of "the observable local
| &gt; environment" problem. 
| ...
| 
| Then again, you can always ping. With a well-chosen target, you get
| 10 bits raw from the first packet... Perhaps about 7 or 8 of actual
| usable entropy (and before you flame me, ping melb.dialix.oz.au).

Yes, but if one assumes that the algorithm to gather the seed is
known, its quite possible for someone else to do it at the same time
as you do it, or even observe your ping packet req/reply. And how do
you determine which 'random host' to ping?

| Part of this is that once the sources of randomness are sufficiently
| diverse, it's just easier for an attacker to modify your s/w.
| Especially if you never throw out your seed, so that all your interactions
| since the beginning are unfathomably stirred into your current key.

Yes, I believe this is important too.
