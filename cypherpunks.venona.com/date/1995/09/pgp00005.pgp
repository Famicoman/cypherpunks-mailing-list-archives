There is this widespread and wholely misplaced affection for
"cypherpunks". We aren't a company or an organization. This is a
mailing list, and occassionally a seminar series in places like
NoCal. It isn't a "group".

- ----- End of forwarded message from Perry E. Metzger -----

For better or worse, in the media we ARE a group, and whatever
attention we are currently getting is based largely on the
entertainment value of the "romantic outlaw" image of that group.

And while this no doubt strikes most of us as faintly ridiculous,
given the seriousness of the current public-policy crisis over
cryptography, I think we have a certain responsibility to make the
most of whatever influence we may have in the media, while it lasts.
