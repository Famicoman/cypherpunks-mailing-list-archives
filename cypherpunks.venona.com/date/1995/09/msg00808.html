&gt; Why would they use your copy of the program to decrypt the file?
&gt; They could just use a version that lacked this 'feature'.  Of
&gt; course, they still couldn't get at the real plaintext unless you
&gt; gave them the key, but you are right back to the same old standoff
&gt; where they say, "Give us your key," and you (try to) say, "No."

I agree, you can't rely on them using your doctored program, it must
be resilient to them having a copy of all of your software, and their
own fresh copies of software, and a backup of each copy before
starting, and still provide pluasible deniability.

Here's an idea to do just that, perhaps something which could be added
to a future PGP.

I reckon this is what you'd do:

% pgp -es duress
% pgp -es msg
% stealth &lt; msg.pgp &gt; msg.stl
% cat msg.stl &gt;&gt; duress.pgp
% pgp +makerandom=1234 noise
% cat noise &gt;&gt; duress.pgp
% pgp -a duress.pgp
% mail someone &lt; duress.asc

The pgp +makerandom=&lt;size&gt; &lt;file&gt; is an undocumented feature of pgp &gt;
2.6 (not sure exactly when it got added, Colin Plumb pointed it out
when I asked him about ran nos for stealth).

So what this means is that you are using PGP it's self to hide a
stegoed message.  This would be good for the guy from FACTnet
(forgotten his name) who just got hit by the CoS, he could hold out
for a while, then give up his key, the duress message would appear,
and the real message would be explained by having a script to do this
on his HD, and having long since burned the disk with a script to do
the above on it:

% pgp -es msg
% pgp +makerandom=4567 noise
% cat noise &gt;&gt; msg.pgp
% pgp -a msg.pgp
% mail someone &lt; msg.asc

ie the idea is that you pad your message to a fixed size for the
express purpose of hampering traffic analysis (of the type of my,
Alice did have a lot to say to Bob that day).  It would be even better
cover if the thing had gotten sent through a remailer, as this kind of
thing is expected of type I remailer traffic (before mixmaster which
does the packetizing for you).

So the duress message really looks like this:

+---------+---------------------------+--------------------+--------+
| pgp hdr | IDEA encrypted duress msg | stealthed real msg | noise  |
+---------+---------------------------+--------------------+--------+

the IDEA block has a length field, but you can increase the length
without damage to include the following stealthed stuff as the
underlying stuff which is IDEA encrypted will know it's length on
decryption, and the following junk will just be discarded.

So, Alice and her secret key ring (encrypted) gets nabbed by the
Charlie (CoS?), and coerced into divuling her passphrase.

And if and when it is noticed that the message was longer than it
ought to be (CoS that smart? substitute the NSA and they'd notice for
sure), Alice explains away the junk on the end by pointing them to the
fact that all of her messages where exactly (say) 16k long, and that
she was using a the noise only script, and that the message really is
this:

+---------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
| pgp hdr | IDEA encrypted duress msg | noise                       |
+---------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+

Having this built-in to PGP provides plausible deniablity as you have
no extra software which might look incriminating unless you managed to
dispose of it first, if it comes as stock.  Even as a standalone it
would be feasible, but you'd need to be careful to hide the first
script, maybe on an encrypted drive or something.  This is not good
tho as you ideally want nothing left, just a standard pgp
implementation, and they have no way to prove anything, they can be
suspicious, but suspicion can't put you in jail, and if you say there
is no message, only random junk for padding purposes to foil traffic
analysis this would be plausible, especially if they really had
captured a whole load of 64k messages.

You really need to use stealth2 for that, as stealth1.x gives the game
away for determined attackers, but for stealth2, I need some
cryptographic opinions on whether this is secure:

	0 &lt; x &lt; N

N is RSA modulus, and converting that to a number x' in the range:

	0 &lt; x' &lt; 2^(int(log2(N) + 1) + 64)

(ie the next power of 2 over N multiplied by 2^64)

and the transformation supplied by:

	x' = N * f(MD5(x)) + x

where f(y) is a function which converts from range 0 &lt;= y &lt; 2^128 to a
range 0 &lt;= f(y) &lt; scale.  Scale some constant defined in terms of N,
and n other randomisation.

Is that safe?

x is random, and will be different even for a repeat encryption of the
same file, as PGP is using a random IDEA session key.

So are there any brute force attacks on that which would be cheaper
than attacking 128 bit IDEA?  PGP's random number generator also makes
extensive use of MD5, so I'm taking the use of MD5 as secure as a
given.

If it is thought to be dangerous for some reason (it is after all some
kind of signature on it's self, presume that you know N, and x' but
not x, the question is can the equation be brute force reversed in a
less than 128 bit brute force attack.  I'm neglecting to consider the
rand() calls, which I'm not expecting to add security, but are just a
mechanism to stir the value with to get more random nos, as
occasionally the alogrithm needs more than one, if the first fails,
etc.

The other approach, presuming that you can get to the data before they
can, is to use secure drive, and securely wipe (or physically destroy
- data on floppy) the encrypted key.  Then you can give your
passphrase without concern.  Could land you in trouble for destruction
of evidence or some such tho, so innocent, plausible deniability would
be better.
