Grumpiness warning: I have held my tongue the past few months as all of
these "this t-shirt has been declared a munition!!!" messages went out, but
I can hold my tongue no longer.

&gt;...and in private email, Jim Ray pointed out that showing the shirt to a
&gt;foreign national might technically violate ITAR...

Nope, no more so than letting a foreign national read Schneier's book is a
violation of the ITAR. If you dispute this, ask whether Schneier's book is
banned from export (the book, not the optional diskette). It isn't. Nor are
other cryptography _books_ banned from export.

I'm not minimizing the issue of export of machine-readable code, as in
diskettes. But to claim that a blurry, printed on cotton "barcode" is even
remotely in the same class as exporting a workable set of cryptographic
system routines, or that letting a furriner merely "gaze upon" this blurry
barcode, is a violation of the ITARs is laughable.


&gt;Yeah, I suppose I overstated it a bit. It appears that if the ITAR do cover
&gt;the shirt (unclear at present, AFAIK -- any news on the CJR, Raph ?), then
&gt;flashing it at a furriner could constitute a violation. Thanks for the
&gt;correction.

No. No more so than "flashing" a copy of a crypto book would constitute a
violation.

&gt;
&gt;The gist of my previous message remains: No local or state authority in the
&gt;U.S. (of which I'm aware) classifies strong cryptography as a munition,
&gt;weapon, etc. I haven't heard of any restrictions on transporting crypto
&gt;across state lines, either. Unless the Feds start cracking down on high
&gt;schools, or the Perl-RSA shirt somehow violates some school dress code, (gang
&gt;colors ? ;)  the original questioner need not fret about his son wearing the
&gt;shirt to school.

It was this series of posts about whether wearing the "munitions t-shirt"
near schools was a crime or not that made me think the silly season had
arrived. If the t-shirt is a munition, and books are munitions, then
libraries must be real "ammunition dumps," ready to explode at any minute.

Let's get real.
