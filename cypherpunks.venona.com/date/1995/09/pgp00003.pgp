Elm does something along these lines.  It has a routine strfcopy() which you
basically call as:
	strfcpy (dest, source, sizeof (dest));

I also wrote a strmcopy() which malloc()s enough space to hold the string if
it is not availible.  I therefore guarantee that I will not overwrite the
intended memory area.
