1.  Anonymity raises the price of credit; the market will
	decide, probably variously, how that increase will
	be distributed among borrowers.

2.  I suspect the taxation authorities would have an interest
	and that it would be counter-anonymity, producing
	friction that would further increase the above cost.

&gt; I was thinking about some issues related to electronic commerce, and it
&gt; occurred to me that there is a significant problem in conducting
&gt; business with untraceable pseudonyms (anonyms?).  The problem occurred
&gt; to me while considering inheritance.
&gt; 
&gt; If one operates a business under an anonym (as opposed to the sort of
&gt; conditionally traceable pseudonym proposed by AT&amp;T in "Anonymous Credit
&gt; Cards" &lt;URL:<A  HREF="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/anoncc/anoncc.ps.Z">ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/anoncc/anoncc.ps.Z</A>&gt;),
&gt; there's a strategy for transferring unlimited funds to one's
&gt; posterity.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider a business which typically has a lot of assets, but which are
&gt; offset by a lot of liabilities --- almost any sort of VAR will do, for
&gt; instance.  In your will, you leave the key to unlock a private message
&gt; to your heir, in which you hand over the information necessary to
&gt; assume your anonym.  Since the heir presumably has his own identity
&gt; (whether anonymous or not is immaterial, except to *his* heirs), and
&gt; the anonym can't be linked to you, he has no reason to care about
&gt; maintaining the reputation of the anonym.  In dismantling the anonym,
&gt; he sells its assets to his own identity at a fraction of their worth,
&gt; and defaults on the liabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the anonym behaved reputably during its life, it developed what
&gt; would have been a credit-worthy reputation, had it been a (traceable)
&gt; pseudonym.  But, since there's nothing to link the anonym to its heirs
&gt; (or ancestors), the creditors of the anonym must eat the loss.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the process of taking an anonym from scratch to a positive
&gt; reputation would be reasonably short (presumably not too much longer
&gt; than taking a real name or pseudonym the same distance), especially when
&gt; helped along by being fed the profits from the legitimate business of
&gt; an ancestor anonym, it's likely that a single individual could pull off
&gt; such an asset transfer at least two or three times a decade, as well as
&gt; at inheritance time.
&gt; 
&gt; A market which permits anonyms to have credit based on reputation will
&gt; probably have a constant stream of defaults caused by such behavior,
&gt; representing a significant risk factor in extending credit to anonyms
&gt; which can't be predicted by reputation.
