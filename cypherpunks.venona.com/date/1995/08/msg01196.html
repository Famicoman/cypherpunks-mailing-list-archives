This was put together to hopefully promote greater awareness of the security
lists that already exist.  Most security mailing lists have been only
announced once and it was only word of mouth that it would acquire new
members.  This list should hopefully make the membership grow for each
mailing list.

If you know of any mailing lists that have been skipped, please e-mail
cklaus@iss.net with the info. 

The newest updates for this will be on <A  HREF="http://iss.net/">http://iss.net/</A>.  This web site
also contains info for the following security issues:

	Vendor security contacts
	Security Patches
	What to do if you are compromised
	Set up Anon ftp securely
	Sniffers attacks and solutions


	
Security Mailing Lists

security officers, security consultants, and anyone who needs to keep abreast
of the most current security information available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8lgm (Eight Little Green Men)

To join, send e-mail to majordomo@8lgm.org and, in the text of your message
(not the subject line), write:

     subscribe 8lgm-list

Group of hackers that periodically post exploit scripts for various Unix bugs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Academic Firewalls

To join, send e-mail to majordomo@net.tamu.edu and, in the text of your message
(not the subject line), write:

     SUBSCRIBE Academic-Firewalls

This is an unmoderated list maintained by Texas A&amp;M University. Its purpose is
to promote the discussion and use of firewalls and other security tools in an
academic environment. It is complementary to the Firewalls list maintained by
Brent Chapman (send subscription requests to Majordomo@GreatCircle.COM) which
deals primarily with firewall issues in a commercial environment. Academic
environments have different political structures, ethical issues, expectations
of privacy and expectations of access.

Many documented incidents of cracker intrusions have either originated at or
passed through academic institutions. The security at most universities is
notoriously lax or even in some cases completely absent. Most institutions
don't use firewalls because they either don't care about their institution's
security, they feel firewalls are not appropriate or practical, or they don't
know the extent to which they are under attack from the Internet.

At Texas A&amp;M University we have been using a combination of a flexible packet
filter, intrusion detection tools, and Unix security audit utilities for almost
two years. We have found that simple firewalls combined with other tools are
feasible in an academic environment. Hopefully the discussion on this list will
begin to raise the awareness of other institutions also.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best of Security

To join, send e-mail to best-of-security-request@suburbia.net with the
following in the body of the message:

     subscribe best-of-security

REASONS FOR INCEPTION

In order to compile the average security administrator it was found that the
compiler had to parse a foreboding number of exceptionally noisy and
semantically-content-free data sets. This led to exceptionally high load
averages and a dramatic increase in core entropy.

Further, the number, names and locations of this data appears to change on an
almost daily basis; requiring tedious version control on the part of the mental
maintainer. Best-of-Security is at present an un-moderated list. That may sound
strange given our stated purpose of massive entropy reduction; but because best
often equates with "vital" and the moderator doesn't have an MDA habit it is
important that material sent to this list be delivered to its subscribers' in
as minimal period of time as is (in)humanly possible.

If you find *any* information from *any* source (including other mailinglists,
newsgroups, conference notes, papers, etc) that fits into one of the acceptable
categories described at the end of this document then you should *immediately*
send it to "best-of-security@suburbia.net". Do not try and predict whether or
not someone else will send the item in question to the list in the immediate
future. Unless your on a time-delayed mail vector such as polled uucp or the
item has already appeared on best-of-security, mail the info to the list! Even
if it is a widely deployed peice of information such as a CERT advisory the
proceeding argument still applies. If the information hasn't appeared on this
list yet, then SEND IT. It is far better to run the risk of minor duplication
in exchange for having the information out where it is needed than act
conservatively about occasional doubling up on content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugtraq

To join, send e-mail to LISTSERV@NETSPACE.ORG and, in the text of your message
(not the subject line), write:

     SUBSCRIBE BUGTRAQ

This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
vunerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
security holes and risks.

Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
to the Bugtraq list:

   *  Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
   *  Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
   *  Patches, workarounds, fixes
   *  Announcements, advisories or warnings
   *  Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
   *  Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
   *  Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security
     organizations
   *  Incident advisories or informational reporting

message (not the subject line), write:

     subscribe cpd

The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is run

society as it presents us with new devices and applications. Technology can
enhance and detract from privacy.

The Sneakers mailing list is for discussion of LEGAL evaluations and
experiments in testing various Internet "firewalls" and other TCP/IP network
security products.

   *  Vendors are welcome to post challenges to the Internet network security
     community
   *  Internet users are welcome to post anecdotal experiences regarding

To join, send e-mail to LISTSERV@lehigh.edu and, in the text of your message
(not the subject line), write:

     SUBSCRIBE virus-l your-name

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing information and ideas
about computer viruses, which is also distributed via the Usenet Netnews as
comp.virus. Discussions should include (but not necessarily be limited to):
current events (virus sightings), virus prevention (practical and theoretical),
and virus related questions/answers. The list is moderated and digested. That
means that any message coming in gets sent to me, the editor. I read through
the messages and make sure that they adhere to the guidelines of the list (see
below) and add them to the next digest. Weekly logs of digests are kept by the
LISTSERV (see below for details on how to get them). For those interested in
statistics, VIRUS-L is now up to about 2400 direct subscribers. Of those,
approximately 10% are local redistribution accounts with an unknown number of
readers. In addition, approximately 30,000-40,000 readers read comp.virus on
the USENET.

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing urgent virus warnings
among other computer users. Postings to VALERT-L are strictly limited to
warnings about viruses (e.g., "We here at University/Company X just got hit by
virus Y - what should we do?"). Followups to messages on VALERT-L should be
done either by private e-mail or to VIRUS-L, a moderated, digested, virus
discussion forum also available on this LISTSERV, LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU. Note
that any message sent to VALERT-L will be cross-posted in the next VIRUS-L
digest. To preserve the timely nature of such warnings and announcements, the
list is moderated on demand (see posting instructions below for more
information).

What VALERT-L is *not*?

A place to to anything other than announce virus infections or warn people
about particular computer viruses (symptoms, type of machine which is
vulnerable, etc.).
