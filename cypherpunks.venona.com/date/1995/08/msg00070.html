&gt; 
&gt; Australia's proposed crypto policy:
&gt; 
&gt; (1)     Banks will get key escrow
&gt; 
&gt; (2)     Other Australian residents will be forced to use weak crypto
&gt; 
&gt; Source: talk by Steve Orlowski, Assistant Director, Australian attorney 
&gt; general's department, given at the Cryptography Policy and Algorithms 
&gt; Conference, Queensland University of Technology, last month.
&gt; 
&gt; p 34: `the needs of the majority of users of the infrastructure for
&gt;       privacy and smaller financial transactions can be met by lower 
&gt;       level encryption which could withstand a normal but not 
&gt;       sophisticated attack against it. Law enforcement agencies could 
&gt;       develop the capability to mount such sophisticated attacks. 
&gt;       Criminals who purchased the higher level encryption products 
&gt;       would immediately attract attention to themselves.'
&gt; 
&gt; He mentioned that his department considered itself a suitable repository
&gt; for the government central decrypting unit, which would decrypt traffic 
&gt; for local police forces. He also wants to escrowed keys for banks and 
&gt; other organisations allowed to use strong crypto. 
&gt; 
&gt; Centralising the wiretap capability with the AG is represented as a useful
&gt; safeguard against abuse of power by local police forces. It would be
&gt; presented as a `data recovery' facility in order to reassure the voters.
&gt; 
&gt; Centralisation will enable the AG to acquire the capability to use ``more 
&gt; sophisticated techniques in circumstances where the key cannot, for 
&gt; whatever reason, be recovered from escrow''.
&gt; 
&gt; So the technical parameters would appear to be: 40 bit keys for the 
&gt; masses, 56-bit escrowed keys for the banks, and a Wiener machine sitting
&gt; in Orlowski's office. Belt, braces and string.
&gt; 
&gt; Curiously enough, he quotes a `Review of long Term Cost Effectiveness
&gt; of Telecommunications Interception' as saying that ``Encryption by 
&gt; targets of their communications (both voice and data) is not considered
&gt; as a problem for TI at present in Australia'' and goes on to say that
&gt; ``there has been comparatively little market for voice encryption 
&gt; products, although they have been readily available''. 
&gt; 
&gt; He even produces some good arguments for the EFF, such as that much of
&gt; the intelligence comes from the call log data and from calls to third 
&gt; parties such as airlines and hotels which are not encrypted.
&gt; 
&gt; He also says that the OECD countries will hold a meeting on National 
&gt; Cryptography Policies later this year. While at the conference, I found
&gt; out that a classified meeting took place this March in Germany between 
&gt; the signals intelligence agencies of the developed countries, plus
&gt; Australia and South Africa, at which the assembled spooks agreed to
&gt; press their governments to bring in escrow and/or weak crypto.
&gt; 
&gt; Australia seems rather eager to lick Uncle Sam's boots on this issue. 
&gt; I wonder what the payoff was?
