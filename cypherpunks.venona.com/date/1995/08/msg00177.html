&gt;I'm afraid I don't follow. Are you saying that the NSA is assuming a more 
&gt;public role because (apparently) stong crypto is now widely available to 
&gt;the public?

yep. Sorry if I was unclear. Possibly even the recent Rosenburg
revelations are related, though they were reported in the media 
[in Miami at least] as coming from "the CIA" rather than from the
NSA. &lt;sarcastic, unspoken, thoughts about "The Herald" here&gt;

&gt;I don't see the connection between A and B if this is what 
&gt;you are claiming.

I do, but I am told I'm "paranoid." If I were running the NSA, I would
_NOT_ leave an obvious connection anyway, but those who know me say I'm
not exactly "NSA material."  ;-)

&gt;
&gt;Unless they're gearing up for a PR campaign...

Which is my theory. "They," for me, includes FBI director Freeh, whose
post OK City mass-murder paranoid anti-crypto comments I saw on C-SPAN. 
[Hence my PGP comment below.]

&gt;I wonder how the NSA has 
&gt;been portrayed in Hollywood in the past. I've just seen them mentioned in 
&gt;one movie I can think about ("Crimson Tide"). Anyone else know of references?

Sorry, I'm almost movie-illiterate these days, but I do plan to see "the 
Net" soon,and I promise NOT to post my "review" unless I can add anything
meaningful to the previous ones, which is doubtful.&lt;g&gt;

&gt;

&gt;disagree." - Jefferson
&lt;partial snip&gt;
Agreed. "Liberty is like love, in that you can't have any until you give it
all away." [Unknown author, aprox. quote]
