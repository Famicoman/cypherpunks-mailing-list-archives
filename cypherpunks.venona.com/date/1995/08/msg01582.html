&gt; You don't have to look to death and inheritance for this problem to crop

But these are problems of fraud that the criminal and civil
justice systems already comprehend.  I think what is posited
is something a bit more unique.

&gt; 
&gt; - a pseudonym simply decides to dissolve the current pseudonym and shift
&gt; focus to another pseudonym (perhaps transferring a bunch of assets, then
&gt; simply vanishing and leaving "no forwarding address')
&gt; 
&gt; (This is of course the basis of any number of scams and "boiler room
&gt; operations." Crypto does not completey eliminate scams like this, and, in
&gt; fact, generates some new kinds of scams.)
&gt; 
&gt; - this is also a well-known problem with any services that handle money,
&gt; valuables, etc. For example, the money courier who vanishes to Rio de
&gt; Janeiro.

I don't think bonding is applicable in this posit, given the 
assumed established creditworthiness of the original anonym.
Perhaps he originally posted a bond, but the market would 
probably have dispensed with that condition as an unnecessary
formality at some point in his glowing credit history.

MacN
&gt; 
&gt; This is one thing that _bonding_ is designed to partially ameliorate. One
&gt; posts a bond which is greater than the amount being carried, or at least is
&gt; some large amount. (Calculations are complex, and various agencies may have
&gt; various policies, depending on other reputation factors.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Since the anonym behaved reputably during its life, it developed what
&gt; &gt;would have been a credit-worthy reputation, had it been a (traceable)
&gt; &gt;pseudonym.  But, since there's nothing to link the anonym to its heirs
&gt; &gt;(or ancestors), the creditors of the anonym must eat the loss.
&gt; 
&gt; The concept of "reputation capital" is a critical one.
&gt; 
&gt; ideally, one never "trusts" an agent with a transaction greater than the
&gt; value of the reputation capital he will lose if he defaults.
&gt; 
&gt; There are still scams and manouvers to thwart this reputation capital
&gt; scheme. The agent planning to "defect" (default, split, abscond, renege,
&gt; etc.) can try to pile up as many pending transactions as possible,
&gt; anticipating that the various transactees will be unaware of each other.
&gt; (This of course happens in real life.)
&gt; 
&gt; Whether cryptographic protocols (cf. the "encrypted open books" proposal by
&gt; eric Hughes for one approach which may be useful) solve this problem is not
&gt; known at this time. But the non-crypto world has of course not solved this
&gt; problem, either.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;A market which permits anonyms to have credit based on reputation will
&gt; &gt;probably have a constant stream of defaults caused by such behavior,
&gt; &gt;representing a significant risk factor in extending credit to anonyms
&gt; &gt;which can't be predicted by reputation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Comments?
&gt; 
&gt; Lots of issues need to be thought about. My hunch is that economists, game
&gt; theorists, and scam artists will all discover digital money and pseudonyms
&gt; and will explore various aspects of this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; I devoted a pretty big chunk of my Cyphernomicon to these "darker sides" of
&gt; anonymity, of reputation capital, and suchlike. By no means did I cover all
&gt; the issues of "crypto anarchy," but I suggest interested folks take a look
&gt; at the chapter on crypto anarchy for more discussion.
