&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; Someone asked about the SSL challenge. Well  if you're interested
&gt; here is a personal view from a "client" participant. 
&gt; 
&gt; Despite criticisms posted to this 
&gt; list I think it worked pretty well for a first attempt,
&gt; mainly due to Piete for hacking out new code and fixing things
&gt; pretty quickly when things went wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; There was very little time to test software initially and
&gt; get problems ironed out. I couldn't get brutessl to compile
&gt; without tinkering and had timeout problems with brclient 
&gt; due to the sometimes slow
&gt; link from Austalia. Later versions of client software (that I didn't
&gt; get till half way through the challenge) seemed to run without
&gt; any problems and without losing ACKs. But my old client had failed
&gt; to ACK quite a few of its earlier keyspaces and due to lack
&gt; of a logfile I ended up writing a script to redo them and
&gt; ACK them with the new version of the client software.
&gt; 
&gt; One problem with being in Australia was that I was asleep when
&gt; new software updates were announced and tended to get them later
&gt; than everyone else, and because of this an auto-update would
&gt; be particularly useful to me if we do this again.
&gt; 
&gt; In the end it needed a bit of user intervention to get all
&gt; my keyspaces ACKed but the problems were sorted out by the
&gt; time the challenge was half way through and I think the next
&gt; time we try this (and I hope we will) it will run much more
&gt; smoothly. It was a good "learning" experience for all of us
&gt; (especially Piete!) and should be regarded as what it was:
&gt; an experiment that didn't run completely smoothly but was
&gt; ultimately successful.
&gt; 
&gt; Taking part in the challenge was fun and I hope we can do
&gt; another challenge sometime soon.
&gt; 
&gt; One gripe though - my ACKs don't appear on the credits list ;-(
&gt; 
&gt; Sherry
