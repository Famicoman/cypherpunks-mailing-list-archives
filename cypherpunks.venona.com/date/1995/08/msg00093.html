This showed up on The Spiderwoman list.
Seems accurate.
I endorse it as much as I endorse PGP.
I know most of you filter me out,
but for those that don't, THEN
please read this just for me.

For if this tiny amendment fails,
I do predict there won't be any
discussions of PGP by about 2005.
Simply because PGP will be outlawed by then.

The wheels of Washington grind slowly.
But once started almost never stop.

Love Always,

Carol Anne

HOUSE TO VOTE THIS WEEK
-----------------------

The House of Representatives will vote late Thursday or Early Friday
(Aug 3 or 4) on whether to add the Cox/Wyden Internet Freedom and 
Family
Empowerment Act as an amendment to the House Telecommunications Reform 
Bill (HR 1555). 

The Cox/Wyden amendment is a direct attack on the Exon/Coats 
Communications
Decency Act (CDA). House passage of the Cox/Wyden amendment is the last 

chance we have to defeat the Exon/Coats CDA. If the House fails to pass
Cox/Wyden, the Exon bill will likely become law.

We must act now to head off this possibility. Please take a moment to
contact your member of Congress and urge them to support the Cox/Wyden
legislation (described in the alert below). 

The attached alert is from a coalition organized by the Voters
Telecommunications Watch (VTW) which includes CDT, EFF, EPIC, and other 

online advocacy organizations.

This may be your last chance to make your voice heard on this critical 
issue, so please call before Friday August 4.

THE LATEST NEWS

This week the House of Representatives will choose between
ANTI-FREE-MARKET PRO-CENSORSHIP LEGISLATION (the Exon/Coats
Communications Decency Act) and ANTI-CENSORSHIP PRO-PARENTAL-CONTROL
LEGISLATION (the Cox/Wyden Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act
- HR1978).

THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE AS A CITIZEN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  IF WE LOSE
THIS VOTE, THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT, ALREADY PASSED BY THE 
SENATE,
WILL BECOME US LAW.

The vision of a cyberspace ONLY FIT FOR CHILDREN will become reality.

The Communications Decency Act will be offered by supporters of
conservative pro-censorship groups THIS WEEK.  They will try and amend
HR1555 to include the Communications Decency Act and remove any other
net-friendly language such as the Leahy/Klink study.

WHAT IS COX/WYDEN?

Cox/Wyden (HR1978) is legislation intended to prevent the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) from imposing content regulations on
cyberspace and encourage private sector development and deployment of
parental control technologies.

Throughout HR1978's history, civil liberties advocates from ACLU, CDT,
EPIC &amp; PFAW have examined the bill and recommended modifications to
ensure that the bill does not negatively impact your privacy or civil
liberties.  Although several questions still remain, Representatives
Cox and Wyden are committed to addressing these concerns.  As the
legislation moves to the House/Senate conference committee, civil
liberties advocates will continue to submit changes to the
Representatives' staffers throughout the conference process where the
House bill and the Senate-approved Communications Decency Act are
reconciled.

________________________________________________________________________

CHRONOLOGY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

House vote to occur before Friday August 4, 1995.

Jun 30, '95     Cox and Wyden introduce the "Internet Freedom and 
Family
                Empowerment Act" (HR 1978) as an alternative to the 
CDA.
Jun 21, '95     Several prominent House members publicly announce their
                opposition to the CDA, including Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-GA),
                Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).
Jun 14, '95     The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm
                reform bill (S 652) by a vote of 84-16.  The Leahy bill
                (S 714) is not passed.
May 24, '95     The House Telecomm Reform bill (HR 1555) leaves 
committee
                in the House with the Leahy alternative attached to it,
                thanks to Rep. Ron Klink of (D-PA).  The Communications
                Decency Act is not attached to it.
Apr  7, '95     Sen. Leahy (D-VT) introduces S.714, an alternative to
                the Exon/Gorton bill, which commissions the Dept. of
                Justice to study the problem to see if additional 
legislation
                (such as the CDA) is necessary.
Mar 23, '95     S314 amended and attached to the telecommunications 
reform
                bill by Sen. Gorton (R-WA).  Language provides some 
provider
                protection, but continues to infringe upon email 
privacy
                and free speech.
Feb 21, '95     HR1004 referred to the House Commerce and Judiciary 
committees
Feb 21, '95     HR1004 introduced by Rep. Johnson (D-SD)
Feb  1, '95     S314 referred to the Senate Commerce committee
