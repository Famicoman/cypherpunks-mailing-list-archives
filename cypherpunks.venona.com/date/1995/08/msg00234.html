&gt;
&gt;We are pleased to announce The First International Conference on
&gt;Electronic Commerce, which will be held on Monday, October 30
&gt;and Tuesday, October 31, 1995, at The University of Texas at
&gt;Austin's IC2 Institute in Austin, Texas. This conference is designed
&gt;to address research issues facing academia and industry in the age of
&gt;electronic commerce. The conference will bring together experts in
&gt;both academia and business to identify and develop a set of critical
&gt;issues for research in this area. The dual goals of the conference
&gt;include shared learning on electronic commerce practices and
&gt;defining a research agenda which will directly address issues
&gt;concerning companies today and position them for the challenges of
&gt;tomorrow.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Conference Summary
&gt;-------------------------
&gt;As the fastest growing facet of the Internet and other component
&gt;technologies, electronic commerce offers functionality and new
&gt;ways of doing business that no company can afford to ignore. The
&gt;basis for moving to an electronic commerce is a belief that electronic
&gt;markets have the potential to be more efficient in developing new
&gt;information-based goods and services, finding global customers and
&gt;trading partners to conduct business. Electronic commerce via the
&gt;Internet or the next generation network infrastructure -- Information
&gt;Superhighway -- will change business institutions, operations and
&gt;products/services as we know today, just as the telephone, TV, fax,
&gt;e-mail and EDI changed the way businesses and consumers
&gt;communicate.
&gt;
&gt;This conference is aimed at pushing and provoking electronic
&gt;commerce research and practice to "go where no firm has ever
&gt;ventured before." We expect electronic commerce to obsolete much
&gt;of the accumulated research in business. Instead of merely
&gt;transforming the way commerce is done today from a non-electronic
&gt;world to an electronic platform, the new way of commerce will
&gt;create and demand radical changes in the process, product and
&gt;promotion to better exploit the digital platform.
&gt;
&gt;It is no longer sufficient for electronic commerce to be viewed as a
&gt;path- breaking technology. Electronic commerce is already playing
&gt;an significant role in determining the strategy of today's companies
&gt;in providing value to external and internal customers. The challenge
&gt;facing companies is to increase the effectiveness of electronic
&gt;commerce activities in order to achieve superior business
&gt;performance. As successful organizations have taken a process-
&gt;oriented view of their businesses, they will have to re- evaluate the
&gt;role of the electronic commerce in terms of alignment with corporate
&gt;goals.
&gt;
&gt;Expanded roles for electronic commerce within the business include
&gt;activities which support other internal business processes. Questions
&gt;such as how this activity should be carried out, how electronic
&gt;commerce should be integrated with other organizational units, and
&gt;how electronic commerce technology can facilitate the goals of the
&gt;organization turn out to be complex decisions for executives making
&gt;these investments.
&gt;
&gt;Likewise, electronic commerce can become a key liaison to
&gt;customers. These electronic commerce based organizations are
&gt;increasingly taking on activities which expand the service offerings
&gt;of the company. An new breed of expertise -- electronic commerce
&gt;specialists -- is bound to emerge that focuses on creating increased
&gt;satisfaction and stronger relationships with customers.
&gt;
&gt;However, this emerging electronic marketplace is an unknown and
&gt;much like the "Wild West" of the past needs to be tamed. The
&gt;challenge is simple: using emerging technology how do we create a
&gt;business environment or infrastructure that will ensure efficient
&gt;electronic markets? What does it take in terms of new organization
&gt;structures like the network structures facilitated by smart and
&gt;wireless messaging; new electronic institutions such as brokerages
&gt;staffed by electronic brokers or agents; new business processes
&gt;better suited for mass customization, global sourcing and logistics;
&gt;new financial payment mechanisms and mercantile protocols?
&gt;
&gt;To achieve exploration and exploitation of new frontiers, we need to
&gt;integrate business concerns with the changing technology. This
&gt;conference aims at providing this integration by bringing together
&gt;leading business researchers who specialize in the various facets of
&gt;electronic markets, namely economics, finance, marketing
&gt;production and operations management, and technology experts in
&gt;the industry who are creating the electronic commerce infrastructure.
&gt;In addition, we are inviting experts who specialize in the WWW
&gt;browsers, electronic cash, encryption, software agents, MIME-
&gt;based messaging, EDI and structured documents.
&gt;
&gt;In sum, investments in electronic commerce, whether in time or
&gt;money, typically introduce far-reaching organizational and
&gt;technological issues. The outcome of this conference will be a better
&gt;understanding of the shape, structure, and operation of business in
&gt;the coming millennium.
&gt;
&gt;We hope you are able to attend this conference. Registration
&gt;information and materials are enclosed.
