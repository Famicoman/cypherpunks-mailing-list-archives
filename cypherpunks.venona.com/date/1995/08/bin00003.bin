        ^  that's the culprit

He just indicated that they made a little mistake here. I tried yesterday:
logging in from my home machine did not give me access (German domain), 
probably because I was in another group. Logging in from CompuServe (a
.com domain), the site was completely open to me. So much for export
control...

Wrong. The FTP daemon probably has a wrapper around it which checks where the
call comes from. When it thinks you come from the U.S. or Canada, it probably
starts up the FTP daemon in group 27, otherwise in the default anonymous
group. The idea is nice, but you have to implement it correctly, of course.

That's the dillema: if you export it, you are taking the risk they won't put
up this kind of software for FTP the next time. If you don't, you are 
complying with these stupid laws... But anyway, with the present state of
the MIT FTP server, PGPfone is likely to be all over the (non-US-and-Canada)
place before the weekend is over.
