&gt; &gt; This is why the "not a Turing machine" assertion that the "Professor" is 
&gt; &gt; important.  We know that Turing machine is undecidable, so if we want to 
&gt; &gt; limit behavior, we can't have one.  BUT---we don't know that being a 
&gt; &gt; Turing machine is equivalent to having "unpredictable" behavior.  
&gt; &gt; Furthermore, a "proof" of the "not a Turing machine" assertion is going 
&gt; &gt; to have to be done by--you guessed it--a computer.  And this computer is 
&gt; &gt; running a program which definitely IS a Turing machine, if it is capable 
&gt; &gt; of "proving" that other (suitably non-trivial) programs are not Turing 
&gt; &gt; machines.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is a bit misguided. The Turing machine (TM) is an extremely general
&gt; abstract model of computation. The gargantuan hunk of code that runs the 
&gt; Space Shuttle can be viewed as a Turing machine, as can a "Hello world" program
&gt; written in Visual BASIC. So, there's not really a question about whether or
&gt; not we're talking about Turing machines (unless perhaps you want to discuss
&gt; quantum theorem provers and QTMs :) 

If a statement is vacuous, it needs refining :-).  If I were to state 
that "Program X is not a Turing Machine", I would be stating that program 
X does not model all Turing machines throught its input.  It is the ability 
of some Turing machines to model all Turing machines through their input 
that makes them undecidable.


&gt; Now, Rice's Theorem says that all non-trivial properties of TMs are undecidable.
&gt; If I pick a "non-trivial" property, I can't conceivably build a TM ("write a
&gt; program", if you like) that, upon input of the specification of an arbitrary TM,
&gt; can tell whether or not that TM exhibits the property I picked. This does not
&gt; mean that I can't decide whether some particular TMs have that property or not --
&gt; I can. I just can't write down a procedure that handles the general case.

The problem here is that it is the interesting cases with which we are 
concerned.  If someone wants to write a computer program to "verify" my 
proof of the RSA algorithm, fine.  But I have to be convinced that there 
program does what they claim before I care.  And since their program 
takes mathematical theorems as input, it is already demonstrating 
near-Turing ( :-P) behavior.


&gt; Also, this theorem clearly hinges on the meaning of "trivial". From what I've
&gt; seen, a very strict interpretation is largely appropriate; nearly everything
&gt; except the least exciting of trivial low-level properties of TMs seems to come
&gt; out to be "non-trivial" in this regard. The proof of the theorem is more
&gt; precise about this, naturally, but I've found this useful as a working
&gt; colloquial definition.

I'll buy that.
