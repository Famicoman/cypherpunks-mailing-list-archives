&gt; I stipulated I didn't want any such garbage, I specifically said
&gt; english summaries are not acceptable and you bombard me with them.
&gt; Yet you wont accept others opinion of PGP's security, which verbal or
&gt; other wise, can only be an abstract summary.

The difference between my response to your question and your responses
to my questions is that I tried to answer your questions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You state that crypto should be poved correct and suggest a technique
&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise known as formal specification.  I agree, pgp should have
&gt; &gt; &gt; been written in Z-specs.  If you take a course in formal specification
&gt; &gt; &gt; you will soon see the intractability of the technique wrt large
&gt; &gt; &gt; systems.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I didn't say that.  Perhaps you should review what I said before
&gt; &gt; characterizing it.
&gt; 
&gt; piffle! Your words:
&gt; 	"I think that this issue can generally be addressed by a divide
&gt; 	and conquer strategy.  Prove that the called routines are
&gt; 	correct and confined under all possible parameters, do the
&gt; 	same for the calling routines, do the same for the interaction
&gt; 	between them, and I think you have it."

I don't see wher I said anything about formal specification here or Z-specs.
It's true that proof of correctness for large systems is a hard problem, and
that is one of the reasons that the secure http daemon is designed to be small.
However, the same has not been shown (as far as I am aware) for many of the
other properties that may be interesting from a security standpoint.

&gt; This sounds like performing a formal analsis to me.  And you didn't
&gt; address the intractability anyway.

&gt; &gt; I have shown (not yet proven) certain things.  A graduate student is now
&gt; &gt; working on trying to prove the various properties I believe to be of
&gt; &gt; interest in an automatic theorum prover he is working on.
&gt; 
&gt; The work in automatic theorum proving is ongoing and not limited to
&gt; your grad student or your work.

I never said it was and he is not my grad student.  He is a grad student
who made some comments on the daemons and decided he would be interested
in seeing if some of these properties could be proven.

&gt; &gt; I believe that these things are worth showing (and proving), but you
&gt; &gt; may certainly feel free to disagree with these contentions.
&gt; 
&gt; I said showing by english isn't good enough, proving would be
&gt; fantastic.  I don't believe these issues reside solely with pgp and as
&gt; such you should question computability as a whole before using
&gt; "incomplete specification" in accusing one system to be flawed.

And I told you that we are in the process of, but not finished with, doing
just that.  I never said that any such problems reside solely in PGP.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want prople on this list to repeat after you "I cannot be
&gt; &gt; &gt; certain there is no compromising bugs or backdoors in X" Then I will
&gt; &gt; &gt; go out on a limb and say everyone here will agree if system X is
&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficiently large.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't believe I ever asked anyone on this list to repeat anything. 
&gt; &gt; All I did was ask questions and respond to responses to my questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Your tiresome repetitive question was "Why do you belive X is secure"
&gt; I herby answer exactly as above "I cannot be certain there is no
&gt; compromising bugs or backdoors in X"

If you are tired of hearing my responses to your comments, there is an
obvious solution.
