&gt; I once was a consultant at a small financial services firm, and a (young,
&gt; disturbed) user was going around playing stupid pranks on unattended PCs. I
&gt; mandated the use of screenblankers that kicked in after 3 minutes of inactivity
&gt; and required a password to get back. The user would then reboot the PCs; some
&gt; password was needed to get onto the LAN, but he'd mess with the local
&gt; config.sys's. He eventually got fired and I do something else.

Unfortunatly, the lusers here are brain-dead and don't care about 
anything.  They don't even know the first things about DOS.  We do have a 
couple of geniuses who think they know Windoze (or want to learn it) who 
occasionally play with the icons and groups: one such genious once closed 
a group window, then claimed someone "erased it."  What a dork!  The 
worse is that I have to clean up after them no matter how stupid they are.


&gt; I guess byte values&gt;255 are the IP equivalent of 555. Better than 127.0.0.1 -
&gt; someone might telnet to 127.0.0.1, then ask mgm/ua whose address this is. :)

Well, the loopback is only a single IP address.  If they used that, every 
net.entity would have the same IP.  Not too good. :-)

&gt; My 6yr-old's IBM Aptiva comes with a sound board and the software that reads
&gt; English text and pronounces it in much more lifelike manner than the gizmo in
&gt; the movie. That gizmo sounded annoyingly computer-like, but had intonations
&gt; obviously coming from a human actor.

Nope, sounded right the like the Apple MacinTalk II Pro voices.  They've 
got some really cool voices, some even human sounding.  Check it out if 
you get a chance.  Real intonations: you can hear the voice flex, etc.  
There are some voices that follow songs or other tones.  (i.e. Big Ben, 
Bells, etc.)  They sound like they're singing.

&gt; The notion is very realistic (but the flashy displays in the movie were not).
&gt; At the recent PC Expo at the Javitz Center in NYC, there were tens of PCs
&gt; running various Web browsers to try out. No one was watching over most of them.
&gt; I entered the URL <A  HREF="telnet://uunet.uu.net:119">telnet://uunet.uu.net:119</A>, and sure enough, got connected.
&gt; It accepted 'IHAVE', but I was too lazy to type in an entire Usenet article.
&gt; I (and the heroine) could have telnetted to someone's port 25 just as easily.

Yep.  Those be the same machines where I dropped my Cypherpunx PC EXPO 
V2.0 disks.  Just left a few dozen infront of each machine as I used 
them.  Sort of the sleight of hand that theives use to lift stuff; only I 
didn't take, I put. &gt;;-)
