Nice ideas, but it will probably not work for people who are not directly
attached to the Internet. That's what I like about the current setup: every-
body can participate as he likes (I'm fetching requests on my SLIP-connected
machine with brclient, for example, and hand-dividing them between several
machines). 

I think most of the problems will be solved by a more hierarchical setup, with
maybe a little bit of communication between the second-level servers to do
load-equalizing (ie., pointing clients to one of the siblings).
