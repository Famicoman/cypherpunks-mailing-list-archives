This seems as good a time as any to forward the full text of this to the
list. At worst, Alpha is a solid proof-of-concept of a possible "nym server"
model. IMHO it's actually much better than that.

I strongly recommend reading the below before asking basic questions about 
the workings of Alpha....

&gt; X-Last-Updated-Date: Jan 9 1995
&gt; From: help@alpha.c2.org (Automated reply)
&gt; Subject: Info on anonymous account service @alpha.c2.org
&gt; Reply-To: admin@alpha.c2.org
&gt; 
&gt; This mail message was sent automatically in response to the message you
&gt; sent to help@alpha.c2.org
&gt; 
&gt; This system allows you to create a pseudonymous address of the format
&gt; username@alpha.c2.org.  For security, all messages are encrypted with PGP.
&gt; 
&gt; To create a mail alias, first create an encrypted reply-block for a
&gt; cypherpunk-style remailer.  An encrypted reply block is a message
&gt; encrypted with a remailer's PGP public key, which will be sent to
&gt; your address, or to an address where you can receive messages.
&gt; 
&gt; To create a reply block, you would create a message for a remailer that
&gt; goes back to you:
&gt; 
&gt;  ::
&gt;  Request-Remailing-To: you@yoursite.org
&gt; 
&gt; Then you would encrypt that with a remailer's public key, and prepend
&gt; the necessary Encrypted: PGP header.  When this message is received by
&gt; a remailer, it would decrypt it and send it to you.  It would also send
&gt; you any text appended to the end (outside the PGP wrapper).  Thus, using
&gt; a reply block, it is possible for people to send you mail without knowing
&gt; your real address.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, choose a pseudonym and a password.  The pseudonym-address may contain
&gt; any alphabetical or numeric characters, or hyphens.  The password may not
&gt; contain any spaces.  Then create a message of the following format:
&gt; 
&gt;  From: yourname@alpha.c2.org
&gt;  New-Password: Your_Password
&gt;  Reply-Block:
&gt;  ::
&gt;  Anon-To: remailer@xs4all.nl
&gt; 
&gt;  ::
&gt;  Encrypted: PGP
&gt;

&gt;  -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
&gt; 
&gt; Do not actually indent it; that's just for example purposes.
&gt; Encrypt this with the following public key and mail it to
&gt; alias@alpha.c2.org.  Unencrypted mail sent to this address
&gt; will be deleted automatically.  If everything is correct, your
&gt; mail alias will be created, and you will be sent a confirmation.
&gt; If not, there will be no way for the software to reply to you,
&gt; so the message will be deleted.  If you don't receive anything,
&gt; something is wrong, so try again.  Be sure to test the reply
&gt; block first, so that you will know it works!  Also, don't forget
&gt; to include the address of the remailer, and the Encrypted: PGP
&gt; header at the beginning of your reply block.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the public key:
&gt; 
&gt; -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
&gt; Version: 2.6
&gt; 
&gt; mQCNAi7K8rQAAAEEAMiK09Nd+NfaL4Q14bKT0Ivdj3MdbCjAG6Cs5ULYBS1ZWSLA
&gt; KiHsm0+kPNHqBVOufN7FT2iK0Mbuyk+dZgHG6ScicDkImysRkmso7eh5c9mU9V8K
&gt; M0+ImKJyOwgVLEgyRK5e4h2XHpwSTtpx3zZpk4CsexLGCQNXF+ikm236U0rNAAUR
&gt; tCpQc2V1ZG9ueW1vdXMgUmVtYWlsZXIgPGFsaWFzQGFscGhhLmMyLm9yZz4=
&gt; =xmQf
&gt; -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When mail comes in for your address at alpha.c2.org, it will be
&gt; encrypted with Your_Password, using pgp -cta, appended to the reply
&gt; block and sent to remailer@alpha.c2.org.  Be sure that you have
&gt; the Encrypted: PGP header, and the address of the next remailer
&gt; it is to be sent to!  All messages are held and sent out in random
&gt; order once an hour.
&gt; 
&gt; If you later wish to change your password, send an encrypted message to
&gt; alias@alpha.c2.org containing a From: line with your nickname, a
&gt; Password: line with your current password, and a New-Password: line
&gt; containing your new password.  If the old password is correct, the
&gt; password will be changed to the new one.  For example:
&gt; 
&gt;  From: Dan_Quayle
&gt;  Password: Bush
&gt;  New-Password: Clinton
&gt; 
&gt; You can also include a new Reply-Block.
&gt; 
&gt; A mail alias can be deleted at any time by setting the password to nothing.
&gt; (Send a password change request with nothing following the 'New-Password:')
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sending messages
&gt; 
&gt; Once you have created a working address, you can send mail from that address.
&gt; Simply create a message with standard mail headers, and add your password
&gt; in a Password header.
&gt; 
&gt;  From: jdoe@alpha.c2.org (John Doe)
&gt;  Password: foobar
&gt;  To: alt.anonymous@demon.co.uk
&gt;  Subject: hello world
&gt; 
&gt;  This is my message.
&gt; 
&gt; The message would be delivered as shown, minus the Password: header.
&gt; If the password is not correct, the message is discarded.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Troubleshooting
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some common problems.  If you're having trouble, check the
&gt; following list:
&gt; 
&gt;  - Be sure to use -t option with PGP
&gt;  - Test your reply block and be sure it works!
&gt;  - If you are having trouble creating a certain address, perhaps
&gt;    you already created it, but used the wrong reply block
&gt;    or a different password.
&gt;  - Usenet posts require a Subject: header.
&gt;  - Messages to alias@alpha.c2.org must be encrypted with PGP
&gt;    Be sure you use the correct PGP key; remailer@alpha.c2.org
&gt;    has a different one.
&gt;
