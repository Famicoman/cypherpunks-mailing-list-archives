&gt;                           CALL FOR PAPERS
&gt;
&gt;1996 IEEE Symposium on                              May 6-8, 1996
&gt;Security and Privacy                            Oakland, California
&gt;
&gt;                             sponsored by
&gt;  IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
&gt;                         in cooperation with
&gt;    The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)
&gt;
&gt;Since 1980, the Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier
&gt;forum for presenting developments in computer security and for
&gt;bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.
&gt;
&gt;This year, we seek to build upon this tradition of excellence by
&gt;re-emphasizing work on engineering and applications as well as
&gt;theoretical advances.  We also seek to broaden the scope of the
&gt;Symposium by introducing additional topics.  We want to hear not only
&gt;about new theoretical results, but also about work in the design and
&gt;implementation of secure systems and work on policy relating to system
&gt;security.  We are particularly interested in papers on policy and
&gt;technical issues relating to privacy in the context of the Information
&gt;Infrastructure, papers on securing unsecure applications and operating
&gt;systems, papers that relate software and system engineering technology
&gt;to the design of secure systems, and papers on hardware and
&gt;architectural support for secure systems.
&gt;
&gt;The symposium will focus on technical aspects of security and privacy
&gt;as they arise in commercial and industrial applications, as well in
&gt;government and military systems.  It will address advances in the
&gt;theory, design, implementation, analysis, and application of secure
&gt;computer systems, and in the integration and reconciliation of
&gt;security and privacy with other critical system properties such as
&gt;reliability, performance, and safety.  Topics in which papers and
&gt;panel session proposals are invited include, but are not limited to,
&gt;the following:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Secure systems          Privacy Issues          Access controls
&gt;Security verification   Network security        Policy modeling
&gt;Information flow        Authentication          Database security
&gt;Data integrity          Security Protocols      Viruses and worms
&gt;Auditing                Biometrics              Smartcards
&gt;Commercial and industrial security              Intrusion Detection
&gt;Security and other critical system properties   Distributed systems security
&gt;Novel applications of cryptography and other security techniques
&gt;
&gt;We will continue the session of very brief (5-minute) talks introduced
&gt;last year.  Our goal is to make it possible for us to hear from people
&gt;who are advancing the field in the areas of system design and
&gt;implementation, and who would like to present their ideas to the
&gt;symposium audience but may lack the time and resources needed to
&gt;prepare a full paper.  Submissions for this session will be accepted
&gt;up to April 2, 1996 to permit us to hear of the most recent
&gt;developments. Abstracts of these talks will be distributed at the
&gt;conference.
&gt;
&gt;INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:
&gt;
&gt;Send six copies of your paper and/or proposal for a panel session to
&gt;John McHugh, Program Co-Chair, at the address given below.  Papers and
&gt;panel proposals must be received by November 6, 1996.  Papers, which
&gt;should include an abstract, must not exceed 7500 words.  The names and
&gt;affiliations of the authors should appear on a separate cover page
&gt;only, as a ``blind'' refereeing process is used.  In addition to the
&gt;paper submission, an ASCII copy of the paper title and abstract should
&gt;be sent to the Program Co-Chair (mchugh@cs.pdx.edu) by electronic mail.
&gt;These will be distributed electronically (without author
&gt;identification) to the entire program committee to aid in the
&gt;appropriate assignment of referees. Authors must certify prior to
&gt;December 25, 1996 that any and all necessary clearances for
&gt;publication have been obtained.
&gt;
&gt;Papers must report original work that has not been published
&gt;previously, and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
&gt;Abstracts, overlength papers, electronic submissions, late
&gt;submissions, and papers that cannot be published in the proceedings
&gt;will be rejected without review.  Authors will be notified of
&gt;acceptance by January 16, 1996.  Camera-ready copies are due not later
&gt;than March 4, 1996.
&gt;
&gt;Panel proposals should describe, in two pages or less, the objective
&gt;of the panel and the topic(s) to be addressed.  Names and addresses of
&gt;potential panelists (with position abstracts if possible) and of
&gt;the moderator should also be included.  Panels are not intended to
&gt;serve as alternate paper sessions and it is expected that, with the
&gt;possible exception of an overview of the topic area by the panel
&gt;chair, individual presentations by panel members will be limited to
&gt;five to ten minutes and that at least one third of the session will be
&gt;reserved for discussion.
&gt;
&gt;Submitters of abstracts for the special session of five-minute talks
&gt;should submit one page abstracts to John McHugh, Program Co-Chair, at
&gt;the address given below.  The abstract should be one page or less;
&gt;Email submissions of 30 to 60 lines are preferred. Abstracts must be
&gt;received by April 2, 1996.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or
&gt;rejection of abstracts by April 16.  Submitted abstracts that are
&gt;accepted will be distributed at the conference.  Presenters of
&gt;five-minute talks are expected to register for the conference.
&gt;Overtly commercial presentations are inappropriate.
&gt;
&gt;The Symposium will also include informal poster sessions where
&gt;preliminary or speculative material, and descriptions or
&gt;demonstrations of software, may be presented.  Send one copy of your
&gt;poster session paper to Dale Johnson, at the address given below, by
&gt;January 31, 1996, together with certification that any and all
&gt;necessary clearances for presentation have been obtained.
&gt;
&gt;Again this year, we will attempt to counsel prospective authors.  If
&gt;you have questions about whether or how to present your work to the
&gt;symposium, please send email to the Chair (dmj@mitre.org), and we will
&gt;do our best to assist you.
&gt;
&gt;Information about this conference will be also be available by
&gt;anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.pdx.edu in directory /pub/SP96, on the web
&gt;at <A  HREF="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/SP96">http://www.cs.pdx.edu/SP96</A>. The program chairs can be reached by
