&gt;
&gt; --------------------------------------
&gt;SuperMac records a certain number of technical support calls at
&gt;random, to  keep tabs on customer satisfaction.  By wild "luck", they
&gt;managed to catch the following conversation on tape.
&gt;
&gt;Some poor SuperMac TechSport got a call from some middle level
&gt;official from the legitimate government of Trinidad.  The fellow spoke
&gt;very good English, and fairly calmly described the problem.
&gt;
&gt;It seemed that was a coup attempt in progress at that moment. However,
&gt;the national armoury for that city was kept in the same building as
&gt;the Legislature, and it seems that there was a combination lock on the
&gt;door to the armoury. Of the people in the capitol city that day, only
&gt;the  Chief of the Capitol Guard and the Chief Armourer knew the
&gt;combination to the lock, and they had already been killed.
&gt;
&gt;So, this officer of the government of Trinidad continued, the problem
&gt;is this.  The combination to the lock is stored in a file on the
&gt;Macintosh, but the file has been encrypted with the SuperMac product
&gt;called Sentinel.  Was there any chance, he asked, that there was a
&gt;"back door" to the application, so they could get the combination,
&gt;open the armoury door, and defend the Capitol Building and the
&gt;legitimately elected government of Trinidad against the insurgents?
&gt;
&gt;All the while he is asking this in a very calm voice, there is the
&gt;sound of gunfire in the background. The Technical Support guy put the
&gt;person on hold.
&gt;
&gt;A phone call to the phone company verified that the origin of the call
&gt;was in fact Trinidad.  Meanwhile, there was this mad scramble to see
&gt;if anybody knew of any "back doors" in the Sentinel program. As it
&gt;turned out, Sentinel uses DES to encrypt the files, and there was no
&gt;known back door.  The Tech Support fellow told the customer that aside
&gt;from trying to guess the password, there was no way through Sentinel,
&gt;and that they'd be better off trying to physically destroy the lock.
&gt;
&gt;The official was very polite, thanked him for the effort, and hung up.
&gt;That night, the legitimate government of Trinidad fell.  One of the
&gt;BBC reporters mentioned that the casualties seemed heaviest in the
&gt;capitol, where for some reason, there seemed to be little return fire
&gt;from the government forces.
&gt;
