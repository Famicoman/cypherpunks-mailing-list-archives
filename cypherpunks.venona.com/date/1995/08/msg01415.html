&gt;Subject:Open Letter from Steve Orlowski
&gt;Date: 18 Aug 95 06:52:32 GMT
&gt;
&gt;I've received something that purports to be an open letter from Steve
&gt;Orlowski. Be warned that the letter has no digital authentication with it,
&gt;so it may have been forged. However it reads like the real magilla, so I'll
&gt;post it here in the hope that it might inform debate a little.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;--------------------- cut here ----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your comments on the subject of the use of encryption by private
&gt;individuals.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly I would like to make the point that the debate has arisen from one
&gt;person's interpretation of a paper I gave at a conference on "Cryptography
&gt;Policies and Algorithms"  The full text of that paper is now available on the
&gt;net at
&gt;
&gt;	<A  HREF="http://commerce.anu.edu.au/comm/staff/RogerC/RogersHome.html">http://commerce.anu.edu.au/comm/staff/RogerC/RogersHome.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;The paper carries a disclaimer at the top that the views are mine and do not
&gt;necessarily represent the views of the Australian Government.  The paper sets
&gt;out the Government's policy on telecommunications interception, which includes
&gt;the issue of the use of cryptography as:
&gt;
&gt;"As a result of the Report, Australia is, among other TI issues, monitoring the
&gt;impact of encryption in the telecommunications interception area and will
&gt;re-examine matters in 1997 following the opening of the telecommunications area
&gt;to full competition."
&gt;
&gt;Telecommunications covers both voice and data communications.
&gt;
&gt;The last paragraph of the paper says that there is a need to expand the
&gt;cryptography debate to cover the needs of individual users in the context of
&gt;the information superhighway rather than current Internet users.  The paper
&gt;also points out that issues such as cost, convenience and public confidence in
&gt;cryptography systems will be the main issues.  Public confidence is explained
&gt;in terms that as long as it meets the general requirement for privacy it will
&gt;be acceptable.  I still maintain that the general user of the superhighway  in
&gt;the next century will be satisfied with a lower level of encryption which will
&gt;meet that and cost and user friendliness requirements.
&gt;
&gt;On specific point made in the Internet message, the paper does not suggest,
&gt;either directly or by implication, that individuals should be banned from using
&gt;encryption.
&gt;
&gt;Regarding the use of higher level encryption, the paper supports the concept of
&gt;commercial key escrow where organisations hold their own keys but may be
&gt;required to provide them in response to a court order.  the same would apply to
&gt;individuals who could either hold there own keys or store them with a
&gt;commercial body.  Access to those keys would be by court order and in that
&gt;respect is no different to existing procedures for the interception or seizure
&gt;of telephone conversations or paper records.  There is no suggestion that these
&gt;basic principles, and protection of individual's rights in general, should be
&gt;changed
&gt;
&gt;If individuals were to use lower level encryption there would be no need for
&gt;them to maintain copies of any keys for such systems.  To my mind this is
&gt;preferable to a requirement for keys to be maintained for all encryption
&gt;systems, which could be the result if universal key escrow were introduced.
&gt;
&gt;Finally on the question of interception, the general public expects a
&gt;reasonable level of law enforcement to ensure the protection of their person
&gt;and property.  Governments are required to find a balance between this and the
&gt;rights of individuals to privacy.  Part of this balance is to ensure that law
&gt;enforcement authorities convince a court that there is a need to carry out an
&gt;interception.  There is no suggestion that this fundamental approach should be
&gt;changed.  The paper certainly does not suggest that the Attorney-General's
&gt;Department should become a centralised interception authority.  In fact such a
&gt;role would not be consistent with its role as a source of advice to Government.
&gt;
&gt;I hope the above clarifies both the Government's policy and my personal views
&gt;on these matters.
&gt;
&gt;I consider this to be an open letter and have no objection to it being used as
&gt;such.
&gt;
&gt;Yours sincerely
&gt;Steve Orlowski
