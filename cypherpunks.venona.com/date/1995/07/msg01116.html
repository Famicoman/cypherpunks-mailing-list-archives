&gt;Different cases - the Walkers gave away information on how the Yankees were
&gt;stealing Russian secrets, which the Russians patched up by encrypting.

Really?  Do you have a reference for this?  I am interested.

&gt;The most current information on the Rosenbergs, gotten from decrypted Soviet
&gt;communications and declassified US and ex-Soviet files, indicates that Ethel
&gt;Rosenberg
&gt;was probably innocent of spying, and Julius was spying but didn't give away
&gt;any useful atomic secrets, and that the FBI probably knew at the time they
&gt;had Ethel killed that she was innocent.  

WOW!  Had them killed?  They WERE tried and convicted, you know.  Are you 
claiming evidence was manufactured?  I head David Khan on CSPAN say that 
at least one message mentions Ethel Rosenberg.  If memory serves, he said 
something like "without going in to whether evidence was sufficient to 
convict, and without going in to whether they should have been executed, 
these transcripts show that they were spying for the Soviets"  
(I'm not sure that's accurate enough for quotation marks, but that's the 
basics of what he said.  I have it on VCR.

Do you have additional information?  I'll agree the FBI hasn't always behaved 
honorably, and maybe they aren't entitled to the benefit of the doubt here.

OTOH, actual, admitted facts to this effect might be a great reply to Mr. Freeh 
when he asks to be allowed to punish us when we make our mail so he can't read 
it.
