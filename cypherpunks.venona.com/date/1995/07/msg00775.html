&gt; &gt;&gt; About two weeks ago, there was some talk in here with regards to holding
&gt; &gt;&gt; DC lawmakers crominally liable for passign bad laws.  This was followed
&gt; &gt;&gt; up with postins pointing out that you can't do that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Here's something you *can* do:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"Three strikes you're out" for politicians.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any time the Supreme Court strikes down a law, any politician who has been
&gt; &gt;found to have voted in favor of three such laws is immediately stripped of
&gt; &gt;all offices and rendered ineligible to run for public office ever again,
&gt; &gt;at any level.  (The same might apply to those found to have lied to a court
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A politician who would trade citizen rights for political gain must be denied
&gt; &gt;the benefits of such a tradeoff.  This might prevent the rise of demagogues.
&gt; &gt;Term limits, etc., would of course help as well.  It would also give those
&gt; &gt;politicians who vote for 'motherhood' issues like 'protecting kids from the
&gt; &gt;perverts on the Internet' a good reason to think twice about the real issue.
&gt; &gt;If they REALLY believe they are protecting someone, they will still vote in
&gt; &gt;favor.  If they are going with the flow to avoid criticism, they'll lose in
&gt; &gt;the end.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My reasoning is that any politician whose laws are consistently struck down
&gt; &gt;should be deemed to lack a fundamental understanding of the rights of the
&gt; &gt;citizens of his/her country or jurisdiction.  They are thus a poor guardian
&gt; &gt;of those rights.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You heard it here first.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Craig Hubley
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd love to see the system described in H. Beam Piper's "A Planet for
&gt; Texans" implemented. Under that system, all Politicians are BY LAW
&gt; representing the interests of ALL their constituents. Any constituent who
&gt; feels that he/she is not being adequately represented (or feels that
&gt; his/her views/interests are being misrepresented) is by law granted total
&gt; access to the Politician and may register this disapproval of the
&gt; Politician's Performance in any way up to and including killing the
&gt; Politician. If the Politician (or his/her survivors/friends &lt;g&gt;) feel that
&gt; the constituent used excessive force (such as using a car bomb or a long
&gt; distance weapon like a rifle as opposed to using a personal weapon such as
&gt; a hand gun at close range) or force out-of-proportion to the action being
&gt; protested, they can bring charges in the "Court of Political Justice". In
&gt; such a trial it is the job of the prosecution (ie: The Politician or
&gt; Representatives) to prove that the constituent did, in fact, overstep the
&gt; accepted rules for registering disapproval.

Reminds me of the old Heinlein advice about supplying forceful 
punctuation after the word "but" in: "Of course, it's none of my 
business, but...".  RAH advises against using excessive force - cutting 
the offender's throat is only a momentary pleasure and is bound to get 
you talked about ;)
