&gt;WASHINGTON (AP)  A day in the financial life of a future consumer may
&gt;begin something like this: Wake up, log in, download some e-cash into
&gt;your PCís hard drive, then go cruise the virtual mall.
&gt;
&gt;Itís on the verge of happening, experts told Congress on Tuesday. But
&gt;some caution that, without planning and coordination, the brave new
&gt;Internet world of a cashless, checkless society could turn into an

&gt;
&gt;"On the Internet ... it is difficult to tell if a transaction has taken
&gt;place since there is no central authority to track and report it," said
&gt;David M. Van Lear, chief executive of Electronic Payment Services Inc.,
&gt;a 2 1/2-year-old joint venture of four banks.
&gt;
&gt;"There are currently no standard operating regulations," he said. "In
&gt;addition, there is no central authority to track and report on criminal
&gt;activity, including counterfeiting and money laundering."
&gt;
&gt;It was all a bit mind-boggling for members of the House Banking monetary
&gt; policy subcommittee, whose chairman, Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del.,
&gt;observed, "Some of us can barely read our e-mail."
&gt;
&gt;But, more than 25,000 merchants in 150 countries are already on the
&gt;Internet, selling or advertising products and services to 20 million
&gt;users, a figure that will grow to 100 million within five years,
&gt;according to MasterCard International.
&gt;
&gt;So, Castle said, "it is time for lawmakers to start grappling with the
&gt;implications of ìan entirely new monetary system in cyberspace, one that
&gt; transcends national governments and national boundaries."
&gt;
&gt;For instance, how will the Federal Reserve Board measure the amount and
&gt;velocity of money flowing through the Internet? How will the Internal
&gt;Revenue Service audit transactions conducted anonymously without paper
&gt;records? What laws apply when a U.S. consumer orders a product from a
&gt;business overseas and the goods never arrive?
&gt;
&gt;The lawmakers received seemingly conflicting advice from a panel of
&gt;experts that included Van Lear, executives from MasterCard and Visa
&gt;U.S.A. and Scott Cook, the chairman of the personal finance software
&gt;company, Intuit Inc.
&gt;
&gt;They were told that government will be crucial to fostering stability of
&gt; the new electronic monetary system and public trust in it but that
&gt;premature or too much regulation could stifle innovation.
&gt;
&gt;The new technology, the experts said, will both open new avenues for
&gt;fraud and offer new protections and safeguards.
&gt;
&gt;The system, some said, needs to be fully auditable so tax and criminal
&gt;authorities can reconstruct a series of transactions but it also should
&gt;protect Americansí privacy.
&gt;
&gt;For instance, David Chaum, the pony-tailed chairman of DigiCash Inc.,
&gt;said his version of electronic cash, or e-cash, would provide the same
&gt;privacy protection and anonymity in small transactions as traditional
&gt;cash.
&gt;
&gt;Using encrypted codes and special software that offer much more security
&gt; than the current unprotected transfer of credit card information via
&gt;the Internet, consumers could download cash into the hard drive of their
&gt; personal computers.
&gt;
&gt;They'd spend it by transferring it to merchants via computer. Or they
&gt;could store the cash on "smart cards" equipped with a computer chip
&gt;capable of storing far more information than the magnetic strips now on
&gt;credit and debit cards.
&gt;
&gt;The cards then would function like pocket money and could be used in
&gt;vending machines, parking meters and subway turnstiles equipped to
&gt;receive them.
&gt;
&gt;MasterCard International and Visa are developing similar smart cards
&gt;but, unlike Chaum's, theirs would generate an audit trail that could
&gt;help law enforcement officials combatting tax evasion, counterfeiting
&gt;and money laundering.
&gt;
&gt;Rosalind L. Fisher, executive vice president of Visa, a consortium of
&gt;financial institutions, urged Congress to maintain public confidence in
&gt;new forms of electronic payment by allowing them to be offered only
&gt;through institutions to supervision by banking regulators.
&gt;
&gt;At the same time, she said, ìwe are concerned that additional regulation
&gt; in this area will "stifle innovations ... subjecting many of these
&gt;products to ... premature death."
&gt;
&gt;By way of example, she cited a Federal Reserve regulation that, if
&gt;applied, could require machines accepting smart cards to issue paper
&gt;receipts, ruining the economic viability of the cards for such small
&gt;purchases as a 75-cent soda.
&gt;
&gt;Castle, who plans at least one more hearing on the future of money this
&gt;fall, agreed that Congress should hold off on legislating for now but
&gt;should be prepared to move quickly if problems develop.
&gt;
&gt;"I donít think we need regulations now, but we had better be ready to
&gt;respond ... if some guy can crack a code and create a million-dollar
&gt;account, transfer it around a couple times and end up in the Bahamas,"
&gt;he said.
