&gt; Could someone in the know talk about the relationship between FV and
&gt; the ZLDF? I don't like to spread misinformation, so I won't answer
&gt; based on conjectures.

I'd be interested to hear this too, but what I am concerned about is
that the whole thing is too strongly tied to first virtual.

I mean there was the Yellow Ribbon Campaign but all URLs out of that
page point to FV, no mention of the at least two other (more
convenient for most people, and hence in Phil Zs interests) methods:

a) PGPed email CC no. to Phil Dubois (Phil Zs chief legal counsel)

b) similar PGPed email CC no. to some guy in Europe who was offering
to collect up all of the European donations, and send them to Dubois
in lump sums to save on currency exchange costs.

Both of these I believe have been signed by people who directly have
their keys signed by Phil Z himself, I have a copy of PGP signed a)
saved from the original post made by Hugh Miller
&lt;hmiller@orion.it.luc.edu&gt; and this is what I show to people who ask.

(copy of the bank details from Hugh's post pasted below as [1]
original PGP signed post by Hugh by email).

Geoffrey Kidd &lt;kalothi1@violet.berkeley.edu&gt; has the details from
Hugh's post in his Phil Z Blood Bank which he posts to
alt.security.pgp periodically, the idea being that enough folks give
money to the Phil Z legal defense fund on a regular small donation
basis, if enough people did this he could be supported indefinately.

What I would like to know is why neither of these [a) or b)], and
especially why a) has not been mentioned on any of the widely
advertised yellow ribbon campaign pages... is it for Phil Z ... or is
it for Phil Z with the provision that you start a FV account something
which not everyone who wants to contribute to Phil Z is likely to want
to be bothered doing.

No slur on FV, just it adds unnecesary complications to donations,
through what now must be _the_ most widely publisized USENET based
effort to raise funds for Phil.

    To send a check or money order by mail, make it payable, NOT to Phil
Zimmermann, but to "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account."  Mail the
check or money order to the following address:

    Philip Dubois
    2305 Broadway
    Boulder, CO USA 80304
    (Phone #: 303-444-3885)

    To send a wire transfer, your bank will need the following
information:

    Bank: VectraBank
    Routing #: 107004365
    Account #: 0113830
    Account Name: "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"

    Now here's the neat bit.  You can make a donation to the PZDF by
Internet mail on your VISA or MasterCard.  Worried about snoopers
intercepting your e-mail?  Don't worry -- use PGP.

    Simply compose a message in plain ASCII text giving the following:
the recipient ("Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"); the bank
name of your VISA or MasterCard; the name which appears on it (yours,
hopefully :-)); a telephone number at which you can be reached in case
of problems; the card number; date of expiry; and, most important, the
amount you wish to donate.  (Make this last item as large as possible.)
Then use PGP to encrypt and ASCII-armor the message using Phil Dubois's
public key, enclosed below.  (You can also sign the message if you
like.)i  E-mail the output file to Phil Dubois (dubois@csm.org).
						^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[this is a mistake Hugh made Dubois' address is dubois@csn.org as can
be easily verified from his PGP key, which is signed by Phil Z also]

Please be sure to use a "Subject:" line reading something like "Phil
Zimmermann Defense Fund" so he'll know to decrypt it right away.

    Here is Phil Dubois's public key:

    This campaign letter will be posted in a number of Usenet groups.
I will also be turning it into a FAQ-formatted document, which will be
posted monthly in the relevant groups and which will be available by
anonymous ftp from <A  HREF="ftp://ftp.math.luc.edu/pub/hmiller/PGP/pzdf.FAQ">ftp://ftp.math.luc.edu/pub/hmiller/PGP/pzdf.FAQ</A>.  If
you come upon, or up with, any other ways in which we can help raise funds
for Phil, drop me a line at hmiller@luc.edu and let me know, so that I
can put it in the FAQ.
