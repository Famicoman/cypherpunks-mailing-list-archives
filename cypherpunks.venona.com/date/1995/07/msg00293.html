Subject: Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems   (60K bytes)

[Frank Durand is a concerned citizen in Washington State who is
campaigning to require public discussion before the state adopts a
far-reaching "intelligent vehicle-highway systems" plan.  Some of the
state's plans raise questions about privacy (among other things).  He
recently sent me the enclosed document, which he got from Peter Marshall
&lt;rocque@seanews.akita.com&gt; from KSER Public Affairs in Seattle.  It is
a status report on the state Department of Transportation's advanced
technology projects, and it conveys a vivid sense of how the bureaucrats
and their industry partners are thinking.  I would encourage everybody
to call up their local state (or provincial or national) Department of
Transportation or regional transportation authority, ask to speak to
the expert on IVHS (or, in most countries besides the US, "transport
informatics"), and politely ask for the current status report on that
jurisdiction's advanced transportation technology projects.  (If they
tell you it doesn't exist, they're confused or playing bureaucratic games.
Perhaps you didn't ask for it by the right name.  Persist.)  See if you
can get the report in electronic form; otherwise get it in paper form and
get someone to scan it.  The potential privacy problems with these systems
can all be solved without significant sacrifices in functionality or cost,
so far as I can tell, through suitable choices of technology -- provided
the people in charge have been sensitized to the issues and persuaded to
take the effort to do it in the right way rather than the convenient way.
This is an urgent issue -- these plans are getting set in stone throughout
most of the world RIGHT NOW.  Let me know what you come up with.  ITS
America, by the way, is the trade association of US IVHS suppliers; it is
also an advisory board to the US Department of Transportation.  I'll be
leaving for a meeting on IVHS privacy issues at ITS America on July 22nd.
If you come up with any relevant information, it would be great if you
could send it to me by then.  Or else post details on the Privacy Digest,
privacy@vortex.com.  -- Phil Agre, pagre@ucsd.edu]

.c.HOV, TDM, and Related Projects

%	.c.Travel Time Video Test.;  (Eldon L. Jacobson) This project is 
studying the use of high resolution video cameras and computer software 
that subsequently analyzes the video tapes to compute vehicle travel 
times using the matching license plate method.  WSDOT has arranged for 
Transformation Systems, Inc., of Houston, Texas to perform the work.  The 
field work will be done during June 19-22, 1995, with the analysis and 
the report received about a month later.  We will be looking at travel 
times between HOV lanes and GP lanes.

%	.c.I-90 Lane Conversion.;  (Eldon L. Jacobson or Fred Mannering) 
This project studied the impacts of converting a general purpose lane to 
an HOV lane on I-90 between Issaquah and Eastgate (sometimes called 
take-a-lane).  The westbound conversion (and added lane) was fully 
operational on December 6, 1993.  During January, 1994, the lane 
configuration was revised in the Mercer Slough area, creating a 
bottleneck section on westbound I-90 that has two general purpose lanes 
plus the HOV lane.  After a couple of months the complaints quieted, and 
people appear to have become used to the situation.  On June 27, 1994, 
westbound I-90 ramp metering was implemented.  Some video tape for the 
RafterS data survey was collected the week before the ramp meter 
turn-on.  The draft report was circulated for review late November, 
1994.  Comments have been incorporated into the final report by the P.I.  
The final report is complete and has been published.  Project complete.

%	.c.HOV Lane Evaluation and Monitoring.;  (Eldon L. Jacobson or Cy 
Ulberg) This project will produce the first annual (July, 1992 thru June, 
1993) HOV system evaluation, on the basis of the methodology developed in 
the above project.  It is important to periodically monitor and evaluate 
existing HOV lanes in order to make decisions about the operation of 
existing HOV lanes and about the best location to construct future HOV 
lanes.  The evaluation will consider HOV lane usage, violations, safety, 
time savings, capacity improvements, modal shifts, route shifts, 
enforcement issues, cost effectiveness, and public opinion.
The project will build on existing information to construct a database 
for evaluation of HOV lanes.  Quarterly, annual, and biennial reports 
will be published.  At the end of the research, recommendations will be 
made about the type of data necessary to do an HOV lane evaluation, the 
data collection methodology, what agencies should be involved in HOV lane 
evaluations, and the timing and format of HOV evaluation reports.
Surveys for I-5 South of Seattle (the Southcenter hill area to Midway) 
were mailed out to motorists the week of February 10, 1992.  Opinion 
surveys for Metro bus drivers in the I-5 South corridor were handed out 
in late, February, 1992, and returned in early March, 1992.  All surveys 
have been tabulated and summarized.
Data collection is now proceeding throughout the Seattle area.  In 
addition to obtaining travel time and vehicle occupancy in the freeway 
mainline, vehicle occupancy is also being obtained at some ramps.  Ramps 
are usually easier to monitor, and should reflect occupancy changes 
sooner than the higher volumes on the mainline.
This project was supplemented to evaluate the change from a 3 person 
carpool definition to a 2 person carpool definition on I-5 north of the 
Seattle CBD.  The draft report for the 2+ demo (prepared by TRAC and TTI) 
was received on January 27, 1992.  The final report for the 2+ demo is 
now available.  Contact Eldon if you want a copy.  The results indicate 
that vehicle occupancy decreased, reliability decreased and travel time 
increased in the northbound direction, much of the driving public 
approves of 2+, and there was no evidence that the project affected 
accident rates.  The steering committee made three recommendations.  
First, the results of the demonstration project do not support existing 
policies.  Second, the 2+ should revert to 3+ after a minimum 60 day 
period.  Third, future occupancy requirement decisions should be based on 
a performance standard that measures speed and reliability.
A second supplemental project to the original project was funded.  This 
second project developed a performance standard that measures speed and 
reliability.  The intention was to have an easily measured reliability 
standard for HOV lanes, which could be used when considering revising the 
carpool definition for a particular HOV corridor.  During April and May, 
1992, data collection was done on the I-5 North corridor that was used in 
developing the standard.  A performance standard was adopted by the WSDOT 
HOV Policy Board on August 13, 1992.  It reads:  "HOV lane vehicles 
should maintain or exceed an average of 45 miles per hour or greater at 
least 90 percent of the times they use that lane during the peak hour 
(measured for a consecutive six-month period)."
Collection of data continues throughout the area during each Monday to 
Friday peak period at about 20 different sites.  The draft report was 
distributed before the end of March, 1994.  Review comments have been 
received and the report has been revised.  The final report was shipped 
to the Research Office for printing in December, 1994.  Eldon got the 
final report back to fix some page numbering problems and returned it to 
the Research Office on February 8, 1995.  Final report complete.  Project 
complete.

%	.c.HOV Lane Evaluation and Monitoring (Phase II).;  (Eldon L. 
Jacobson or CyJUlberg)  This is the ongoing data collection and reporting 
project.  Auto occupancy data are being collected every morning and 
evening peak period Monday through Friday.  A 486 computer with a high 
capacity hard drive has been acquired to aid in the data analysis and 
storage.  A two page legislative briefing report has been prepared.  It 
will be distributed (probably in the Ex*Press) with changes and updates 2 
or 3 times a year.  Quarterly data updates are being prepared, which will 
update one of the appendices in the final report described in the 
previous project.  The initial quarterly report is complete (this will 
actually add the 6 quarters that follow the 4 quarters in Appendix B of 
the report in the previous project).

%	.c.I-5 South HOV Lane Accident Analysis;  (Eldon L. Jacobson)  
This is an in-house project to analyze the before and after accident 
information for the HOV lane termination area at the top of the 
Southcenter hill.  The accident data was provided by the Northwest 
Region.  A draft report was circulated on June 1, 1994, and review 
comments are being received.

%	.c.Intercounty Carpool Profile.;  (Eldon L. Jacobson or Cy 
Ulberg) This project will provide knowledge of why people choose to ride 
share.  The primary method to acquire information about a broad range of 
carpools in the two-county region (Snohomish and King counties) will rely 
on surveys of a random sample of people observed in carpools on selected 
freeways, arterials, and streets.  A large number of surveys (on the 
order of 1000) will be conducted by mail, and they may include small 
incentives to encourage a high return rate.  A follow-up survey will be 
conducted after one year.  A smaller sample will be contacted for more 
intensive personal interviewing (focus groups).  This project will be 
used to enhance the HOV 2+ evaluation.  The project match will come from 
that project in order to direct questions toward the carpool definition 
change.  WeUre waiting for the funds to be released by Metro to start the 
project.  The funds have been released and a U.W. budget number assigned 
to the project.  An initial literature review has been done.  Carpool 
license plates have been collected and the public opinion survey is being 
finalized for printing.  The survey was printed and mailed out in June, 
1994.  Surveys have been returned and have been coded for analysis.  The 
project has been put on hold until early 1995, as the graduate student 
who is working on the project, Matt Benuska, is studying for three months 
in South Korea.

%	.c.An Analysis of Factors Accounting for Successes and Failures 
in the Acceptance and Utilization of Employer-Based TDM Programs.;  (Bill 
Legg or Cy Ulberg) This project will carefully investigate the processes 
that companies employ to implement TDM programs.  It will develop a model 
of the factors that influence employee's attitudes and lead to actual 
changes in commuting behavior and will be useful to employers throughout 
the state in designing and implementing successful TDM programs.  The 
project will be coordinated with the State Energy Office and to bolster 
the work currently being undertaken because of the commute trip reduction 
legislation.  The scope of work was developed in cooperation with Metro 
and the Energy Office.  A new element  of the project will be the 
addition of a consultant to look at a proactive program for multi- site 
employers to shift personnel around so employees are working at the site 
nearest their home.  
The draft final report has been completed and has been distributed for 
review and comment.  This project has be given a $95,000 supplement for a 
proximate commuting study.  This study has been initiated and a detailed 
evaluation plan is now being developed.  Proximate commuting is the 
concept of decentralizing work so that employees can work closer to their 
residence thereby reducing commuting time and distance.

.c.Incident Management Projects

%	.c.Incident Response Data Base.;  (Bill Legg or Fred Mannering) 
This project will develop and establish an incident response database.  
The database will be used to evaluate incident response measures 
developed and implemented in the Seattle area.  This project was approved 
in February.  The first project meeting with the researchers and the Data 
Annex in Olympia took place the middle of March.  The Data Annex 
installed the CARS database at TRAC on May 27th.  The project team is 
working with WSDOT's 3 western regions and the East Central region to 
establish a database format Incident report that could be used as a 
standard for the entire state.  This format will be compatible with the 
States' MicroCars database.  Work in also being done on a geographical 
representation of the MicroCars database by combining it with a GIS 
system.  This project's completion date was extended to 6/31/94 from 
12/31/93 to permit more testing of the database.
The draft database (the final level of effort for this project) is 
complete and now being used.  We are looking at any additional needs for 
this project beyond the current completed work. 

%	.c.Evaluation and Application of Washington State's Incident 
Response Guide.;  (Bill Legg or Fred Mannering) This project will 
evaluate the effectiveness, appropriateness, and format of the incident 
response guide currently used by WSDOT's North West Region's incident 
response teams.  Based on this evaluation it will produce an updated 
electronic version of the guide for WSDOT's 3 western regions and the 
East Central region.  Each region will able to customize and update the 
documents as needed in the future.
The project is now complete.   

	.c.Incident Management Training for WSDOT Personnel.;  (Bill 
Legg) This project, through training sessions, will
 	introduce the basic language and protocol for the Incident 
Command System to the WSDOT IRT members,
 	summarize new and existing state and federal regulations that 
impact current incident management practices,
 	identify WSDOT IRT training material suitable for periodic 
"refresher" training, &amp;
 	provide information to Maintenance Area Supervisors on the 
importance of effective incident management.
This project began the first of the year (1995) and training will begin 
this summer.  

	.c.The Use of Total Station Surveying Equipment for Accident 
Investigation: A National Perspective.;  (Bill Legg) WSDOT took the 
national leadership role in the implementation of the use of total 
station surveying equipment by the State Patrol as a way to more quickly 
clear major accident scenes.  This project will determine
 	how the use of total station surveying equipment for accident 
investigation has expanded to other parts of the nation,
 	what factors encourage the use of the technology, 
 	what factors discourage the use of the technology, and 
 	how the quantified and perceived benefits change depending on 
local conditions.  
The survey of national law enforcement agencies has been completed.

.c.ITS Projects

% 	.c.North Seattle Advanced Traffic Management System;  (Morgan 
Balogh)  The primary objective of this project is to provide 
communications to the different traffic control system in the I-5 
corridor from Seattle to Marysville.  This will enable coordinated 
operations among the different jurisdictions traffic signal systems and 
the freeway ramp meter system, provide a regional monitoring and data 
sharing system, and receive real-time information on traffic and transit 
conditions.  This project will be expandable to the east and south to 
include the entire Seattle Metropolitan area.  
Many times political and jurisdictional issues prevent coordinating 
adjacent systems.  These issues will be worked out over the course of the 
project.
This project will endeavor to obtain data from several signal systems in 
the I-5/SR 99 corridor in north King County and south Snohomish County.  
The data will be collected by a separate micro-computer through 
communications links with central traffic control systems (and master 
controllers if necessary) belonging to the various jurisdictions 
involved.  The micro-computer will compile the volume, occupancy, and 
operations data and transmit it back out to the participating control 
systems.  Each signal system will independently use the data to improve 
its traffic management capabilities.  TIB funding for this project has 
been obtained.  The City of Seattle was the lead agency for obtaining TIB 
funds.  Oil rebate money is also being used on this project.  The FHWA is 
contributing 3.5 million in state appropriated IVHS money.  
Dave Berg of the WSDOT, NW Region is managing this project.  Farradyne 
System Inc., is the lead consultant on the project.  FSI started work on 
Nov. 29, 1994.  This was the same date that a kickoff meeting was held.  
FSI has just completed the Control Strategy Report for the project (June 
16, 1995).  It is currently under review.  There have been several user 
group meetings with the next scheduled for June 17, 1995.  FSI is 
currently working on the system design.

 %	.c.Graphical Display of Real-Time Transit Coach Locations: Toward 
an APTS for the Puget Sound Region (BusView);  (Morgan Balogh, Dan 
Dailey)  The project will design and demonstrate a system that 
graphically displays real-time transit coach locations to the University 
of Washington campus community.  The system will use Seattle Metro's 
existing automatic vehicle location system as its information source.  
This is a $170,000 project sponsored by WSDOT ($100,000) and TRANSNOW 
$70,000.  The completion date is February 1996.   
The design of the APTS architecture and interfaces is well underway and 
the evaluation of the accuracy of the AVL data is beginning.  The system 
will be demonstrated at a Transit Conference in Spokane in late August.

 %	.c.Traffic Data Acquisition and Distribution (TDAD);  (Morgan 
Balogh, Dan Dailey)  The TDAD project will provide a system that will 
access available traffic databases and store it in a separate database 
for historical, research, and planning purposes.  Agencies will then be 
able to request from the system specific records, and obtain these in 
formats meaningful and useful to them.  The initial system will be 
demonstrated in the Puget Sound area, together with linkages to state 
level databases and applications.  This project is coordinated with the 
North Seattle ATMS.  This project supports regional Congestion Management 
Plans.  The total project cost is $210,000 and is fully funded by the FHWA.
UW staff has interviewed the parties that will benefit by this project.  
They include planning representatives from PSRC, TRIP, FHWA, and the 
WSDOT N.W. Region.  A working paper outlining the system desired by these 
representative has been prepared and reviewed.  The project team is 
currently working with FSI and the North Seattle ATMS project on system 
integration requirements.  

% 	.c.Puget Sound Help Me (PuSHMe) Operational Test;  (Morgan 
Balogh) The WSDOT has received USDOT operational test funding for a Puget 
Sound regional mayday system.  This is a public-private partnership whose 
participants include the FHWA, WSDOT, WSP, David Evans and Associates, 
Inc. (DEA), Sentinel Communications (SenCom), Motorola, IBI Group Inc., 
and the University of Washington.  Other firms involved in this project 
but not actually on contract are McCaw Cellular and Intergraph.  This 
system will allow a traveler to send a signal indicating their location 
when they need assistance directly to a traffic operations center who 
will then dispatch the appropriate units (i.e. tow truck, assistance van, 
WSP, etc.)  
The cooperative agreement between WSDOT and the FHWA signed on August 1, 
1994.  The project started February 3, 1995.  A equipment purchase 
contract was signed between WSDOT and SenCom as of March 3, 1995.  A 
equipment lease between WSDOT and Motorola was signed 4/4/95 .  The 
project Kick-Off meeting is scheduled for March 28, 1995.  The evaluation 
plan is almost complete and should sent to the PuSHMe partners for review 
in late June.  Motorola has installed their GPS Reference station at the 
TSMC on June 15, 1995 and plan to have their Dispatch running in Mid 
July.  SenCom will begin producing their mayday devices in late June.  
Mayday testing should begin in late July or early August. 

 %	.c.A Real Time Traveler Information System for Reducing Urban 
Freeway Congestion: Expansion, Implementation, and Evaluation.;  (Larry 
Senn or Mark Haselkorn) This is a continuation of the earlier Real-Time 
Motorist information project.  Several enhancements will be made to the 
"Traffic Reporter" information system including expanding coverage of the 
display to include all freeways in the Seattle area and to include 
separate information on the HOV lanes.  Efforts will also be made to 
improve the quality of travel time data and the quality of electronic 
data coming from the WSDOT system.  This project will provide delivery of 
the system for use by the public and will evaluate the system under 
actual use.  
Traffic Reporter has been expanded to cover the Puget Sound area.  
Testing is being done to compare "lap top" travel time data to those 
calculated by Traffic Reporter.  Also, usability testing has been 
conducted on the expanded interface, and will continue once the system is 
on display.  Traffic Reporter can now find multiple freeway routes from a 
given origin ramp to a given destination ramp.  Added features include 
the ability to compare speed and trip time between these routes, 
including a comparison of general purpose versus HOV lanes.  
A rough draft of the final report has been turned into TRAC for 
preliminary review and should be ready to go to the Research Office 
soon.  

 %	.c.Improved Congestion Prediction Algorithm.;  (Improved Ramp 
Control Algorithm) (Larry Senn or Nancy L. Nihan)    This project 
continues the search for an improved ramp control algorithm based on 
predictive techniques.  The project objectives are to: (1) evaluate the 
existing data and the performance of the predictive ramp control 
algorithm used to operate the WSDOT traffic systems computer in Seattle, 
develop improvements to the existing predictive ramp control algorithm by 
looking at upstream volumes and lane occupancies and ways to improve 
pattern recognition, testing the new algorithms on more than one section 
of freeway.
Data collection computer modeling runs have been made and contrary to the 
proposal will likely need to be conducted periodically throughout the 
project.  Preliminary analyses have been performed and strategies are 
being discussed to select the algorithm most likely to be productive.  
TSMC data is now available by modem for UW analysis.  Researchers have 
found that the flow divided by the lane occupancy (F/O) provides a better 
indicator of congestion than indicators that are currently in use.  A F/O 
of 90 indicates the onset of congestion and an F/O of 70 provides an 
excellent indicator of congestion.  Storage, which is currently used by 
the freeway system as an indicator of congestion, does not appear to a 
very good indicator (a result also found in the neural network project).  
The final report is in review.  

% 	.c.Improved Error Detection and Incident Detection Using 
Prediction Techniques and Video Imaging.;  (Larry Senn or Nancy L. Nihan) 
This project seeks to improve knowledge of the relationship of volume and 
lane occupancy to the speed of traffic as a means of (1) determining 
invalid detector data and (2) detecting incidents.  In addition the 
project will attempt to improve the ability to identify bad detector 
data.  Video imaging will be used as an independent check of the 
volume/occupancy and speed relationships.  The video imaging system will 
itself be evaluated as an incident detection tool and as a tool to obtain 
vehicle speeds.
Morgan Wong is the primary R.A. on this project.  He has written a 
program to get 20 second data from Autoscope and is modeling the data to 
improve on the existing error and incident detection algorithms.  
TSMC data is now available by modem for UW analysis.  The project team 
has been collecting additional video data for testing Autoscope.  The 
overall opinion of the researchers is that Autoscope works well enough to 
be considered in future installations.  
The draft final report and draft technical report have been submitted for 
review.  

% 	.c.Bellevue Smart Traveler: Using Traveler Information to Reduce 
Downtown SOV Commuting.;  (Eldon L. Jacobson or Mark Haselkorn) This 
project produced and tested a prototype Traveler Information Center 
designed to increase the use of transit and paratransit (carpools and 
vanpools) by downtown Bellevue office workers.  The goal was to locate in 
a downtown Bellevue office complex a prototype computer-based interactive 
Traveler Information Center that provided office workers with greater 
access to flexible, reliable, safe, and time efficient alternatives to 
single occupancy vehicle commuting.  The prototype allowed us to gauge 
the impact of applying ATIS technology to enhancing transit and 
paratransit.  It also allowed us to judge the viability of Traveler 
Information Centers as a way for downtown centers to meet trip reduction 
requirements set by the State of Washington.
The project was funded by WSDOT and FTA.  Work was conducted as a 
partnership between the Bellevue TMA and the University of Washington.  
The project was originally scheduled to begin 7/1/92 and end 10/31/93.  
The FTA funding period ended up being for 15 months, starting 9/30/92, so 
no-cost time extensions were requested of both the FTA and WSDOT in order 
that both funding periods ended at the same time.
Most of the employee's in the office building (Bellevue Place) were 
surveyed.  Since Microsoft doesn't do surveys, focus groups with 
Microsoft employees were done the last week in April, 1993.  The project 
was expanded to cover more buildings in downtown Bellevue.  Will also use 
a public-private partnership utilizing pagers donated by PacTel (now 
Air-Touch).  The telephone equipment was purchased, the initial 
programming of it completed, and it was tested.  A media event showcasing 
the project was done by the U.W. on September 28, 1993.  83 applications 
were received by the TMA as of November 2, 1993.  The kiosk was opened 
for use in Bellevue Place on November 15, 1993.
Three ride groups were formed.  Some of the interesting statistics as of 
the close of the project on April 15, 1994 are:  496 rides offered, 145 
rides sought, 6 confirmed ride matches.  Preliminary conclusions are that 
people were much more willing to offer rides than to accept a ride.  The 
draft technical report has been written and was submitted to TRAC the end 
of August, 1994, for editing and processing.  The initial editing 
generated substantial suggested improvements, so the report was sent back 
to the P.I. for modification in September, 1994.  The draft report has 
been circulated and review comments received.  The P.I. plans on 
incorporating review comments for the final report during the first week 
of July, 1995.

%	.c.In-Vehicle Signing and Variable Speed Limit Demonstration.;  
(Larry Senn) The project is unique in that its objective is the 
enhancement of motorists safety on freeway facilities through the display 
of variable speed limits and other safety messages based on traffic and 
roadway conditions.  These displays are presented using variable message 
signs and in-vehicle equipment.  The proposed project includes the 
implementation of a variable speed limit and motorist alerting system 
featuring the use of low cost in-vehicle radio receivers with 
alphanumeric displays.  The system is to be installed on a forty mile 
section of I-90 approximately 40 miles east of Seattle in the vicinity of 
the Snoqualmie Pass.  The University of Washington will be responsible 
for the evaluation of the system and the experimental design.  
The installation of data stations for collection of "before" data is 
complete and data collection is underway.  Farradyne has continued the 
systems development, and has found solutions to several issues concerning 
the radio communications system and integration of the weather stations.  
FCC licenses for all sites have been obtained.  The construction contract 
with Totem Electric is underway and at least three sign bases have been 
installed.  The production of the Daktronics VMS is underway and the 
inspection of the first sign occurred on June first.  We hope to test the 
in-vehicle devices in '94-'95 using a portable transmitter, however the 
fixed sites will not have communications until '95-'96 when the entire 
project will be operational.  The UW team has conducted an in-depth 
accident analysis based on 5 years of accident data and has continued the 
development of the driving simulator that will be used to evaluate the 
in-vehicle signing equipment.  A detailed evaluation plan has been 
submitted to NHTSA and has been tentatively approved pending some minor 
corrections.  

%	.c.Seattle to Portland Inter-city ITS Corridor Study and 
Communication Plan;  (Morgan Balogh)  We are in the initial stage of this 
project.  There are three main objectives of the project.  The first 
objective is to develop a plan to reduce congestion and improve safety 
along the Seattle to Portland I-5 corridor utilizing Intelligent 
Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) technologies.  The second objective is to 
identify the communications network needed to support the IVHS for the 
corridor.  Additionally, evaluate alternatives and provide 
recommendations for this network to support WSDOTUs other, non-IVHS, 
intra-departmental communications requirements along this corridor.  The 
third objective is to develop general recommendations for a statewide 
WSDOT communication network utilizing the corridor communications 
analysis.  
State matching funds have been identified and approved.  An Agreement 
between the FHWA and the WSDOT for the Seattle to Portland Inter-city ITS 
portion of this project has been made. 
A request for a service contract to select/hire a consultant was 
developed and published September 13, 1993.  The consultant proposals 
went through the first stage of the evaluation process.  This stage chose 
the top 3 proposals.  The representative of each team was asked to give 
an oral presentation on December 7, 1993.  From these presentations David 
Evans and Associates was chosen to be the prime consultant.  The 
consultant began work May 2, 1994.  The consultant has completed 
Technical Memorandum #4, Draft ITS Corridor Plan in May and is developing 
a draft communications plan.  

%	.c.Portland to Boise ITS Corridor Study;  (Eldon L. Jacobson)  
This project is to develop a plan to identify Intelligent Transportation 
System technologies that should improve some of the known transportation 
problems in the Portland to Boise corridor.  One of the known problems is 
the poor weather conditions that can rapidly appear in the Columbia 
Gorge  and the Blue Mountains.  The corridor includes roads on both sides 
of the Columbia River, two railroads, and barge shipping.
The planned $400,000 consultant study is anticipated to be funded by 
FHWA, ITD, ODOT, and WSDOT.  A draft agreement between the FHWA and the 
three state DOTs has been drafted by the FHWA Region office.  The revised 
draft proposal was circulated for final comments and support letters.  
The proposal was submitted to the FHWA the day before the due date of 
August 1, 1994.  Approval from D.C. was received the middle of January, 
1995, provided the scope-of-work is approved by the FHWA region office.  
The draft scope-of-work was circulated for comments the end of February, 
1995.  The FHWA approval is expected mid-March, 1995, with the RFP 
planned late in March or April, 1995.
Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc., is the consultant that was selected to 
do the study.  The scope-of-work and cost estimate are being worked on 
prior to signing the contract.

%	.c.Seattle to Vancouver, B.C., and Seattle to Spokane ITS 
Corridor Study;  (BillJLegg)  This project is to develop a plan to 
identify Intelligent Transportation System (formally IVHS) technologies 
that should improve some of the known transportation problems in the two 
corridors.  The two corridors may be studied separately, or together, 
depending on whether one or both are approved for funding by the FHWA.  
The planned consultant study is anticipated to be funded by FHWA and 
WSDOT.  
Interviews for final consultant selection will be held on June 22nd.  
Work on this project will begin in the 3rd quarter of 1995.

%	.c.Assessment of ATIS in Washington State.;  (Morgan Balogh) This 
project is primarily funded by FHWA discretionary moneys.  It will 
provide an early evaluation of 4 ATIS in Washington state (FLOW, Traffic 
Reporter, Bellevue Smart Traveler, and the proposed Canadian border 
crossing information system).  The project will develop a matrix of ATIS 
so that appropriate criteria for judging success can be developed and 
applied.  The project will also recommend direction for future ATIS 
development in the state.  Start date for project was 10/01/92 and the 
completion date for the project is 4/30/94.
Tasks completed to date include: (1) Identified classifying system and 
definitions of success for this project.  (2) Designed metrics and 
instruments for assessing Flow.
Delays in the installation of the Vax at TSMC have delayed the 
implementation of Traffic Reporter and consequently the evaluation of 
Traffic Reporter.  That problem has been corrected and the evaluation 
continued.  The final report was submitted to the Research Office in 
March, 1995.  

%	.c.IVHS Data and Information Structure.;  (Morgan Balogh or 
Daniel Dailey)  The overall objective of this project is to develop a 
framework in which to understand, select, and apply wireless data 
communications technology to IVHS development in Washington State.  It 
will (1) review the state of the art of wireless data communications, (2) 
examine promising wireless communication alternatives, (3) perform a 
limited field test of selected wireless data communications, and (4) 
provide the basis for an overall plan to integrate wireless data 
communications into a regional IVHS network.  The final report for this 
project is due December 31, 1994.
The final report was submitted to the Research Office in March, 1995.

%	.c.Investigation of Video Image Tracking.;  (Morgan Balogh or 
Nancy Nihan)  First generation video imaging systems provide Rtrip-wireS 
type detection, that is they mimic the performance of inductance loops.  
The newer video imaging tracking system not only gathers loop type data 
but RfingerprintsS vehicles to provide tracking capabilities.  Vehicle 
tracking provides travel time and origin destination information which 
has been historically difficult to obtain.
The proposed video imaging system for this project is the MOBILIZER, 
which is provided by Condition Monitoring Systems (CMS) and is in the 
prototype stages of development.  
This project will test collected data for reliability and range of 
usefulness, compare cost effectiveness and total life-cycle cost of the 
CMS system to that of traditional loop detector systems, and if cost 
effective, incorporate the system in the WSDOT Traffic Systems Management 
Center.  The final report for this project is due August 31, 1995.
Most of the technical problems with the MOBILIZER have been worked out 
and testing is continuing.

%	.c.IVHS Backbone Design and Demonstration.;  (Larry Senn or Dan 
Dailey)  This project will (1) design a  demonstration architecture for a 
regional IVHS backbone for the Puget Sound area and (2) construct this 
backbone in order to demonstrate how different types of data gathered 
from distinct agencies can be integrated in a single application.  The 
backbone will be designed to (a) improve interagency and 
multi-jurisdictional sharing of data without disrupting existing 
operations, (b) support existing investment in IVHS technology and system 
development, (c) encourage expansion and innovation, and (d) be 
compatible with federal efforts to develop a national IVHS architecture.  
"The backbone will support traffic data from a multitude of sources while 
making data accessible in a clearly defined manner on a geographically 
distributed network.  This all will be done in an open systems model that 
supports a distributed computing environment, is extensible to larger 
areas, and easily allows new agencies to participate.  
The T1 link to the TSMC and all hardware elements to set up the 
communication have been installed.  Software to extract the data is 
operational.  Loop data has been interfaced to the GIS application.  
Software is being developed to make use of the loop data for future 
research.  The final report is being wreitten.  

%	.c.Demonstration of ATIS/ATMS Data Fusion in a Regional IVHS.;  
(Larry Senn or Dan Dailey)  This project proposes to design, construct, 
and demonstrate a data fusion system for use in a regional IVHS system.  
The fusion system will combine data for multi-agency and 
multi-jurisdictional sources to provide a more accurate, real-time 
picture of the transportation system.  This fusion system will operate in 
a distributed computing environment that encourages interagency 
cooperation.  
The computer has been ordered and WSDOT and Metro have been contacted.  
An IVHS application has been written which displays both congestion data 
from loops and real time position of transit vehicles on a GIS based 
map.  King County Metro is being contacted for an improved map database.  
A report is being written in conjunction with an IEEE Intelligent 
Vehicles Conference "95.  

%	.c.IVHS - Network and Data Fusion.;  (Larry Senn or Dan Dailey)  
This Federally funded project will progress from specific regional issues 
investigated in other related projects and generalize by creating key 
network and fusion components that are transferable to other regions and 
countries.  The project will (1) investigate , design, and document an 
encoding scheme, including ways to include temporal information with 
spatial information, for standardization of traffic and traveler 
information, (2) use this encoding scheme to demonstrate a layer between 
application and transport layers, and (3) work with another related IVHS 
research center to use the encoding scheme in a demonstration of its use 
in inter-regional IVHS communication.  
The investigator has started investigation of FIPS spatial data standard 
in detail and determined that the full standard is unwieldy for the 
design of our data encoding system.  Adopting an object oriented paradigm 
to construct self defining data streams.  The methodology for 
constructing the self defined data streams is the encoding stream 
promised for this project.  

%	.c.Investigation of Automatic Vehicle Location Systems for 
Traveler Information.;  (Larry Senn or Mark Haselkorn)  This project will 
use Metro AVL information to improve information available to travelers 
and transportation managers.  
Metro AVL data can now be displayed on any X-terminal connected to the 
Internet and has been demonstrated many times.  This concludes the 
research portion of the project and a draft final is being formatted foin 
prepatration for review.  

%	.c.Ramp Control via Neural Network Control.;  (Larry Senn or 
Deirdre Meldrum)  This project will develop and test a new ramp metering 
algorithm by using an artificial neural network congestion predictor and 
a multi-variable control system.
Artificial neural networks have been constructed and tested.  Promising 
results have been obtained with 1 minute data being used to predict 
volumes and occupancies 1 minute ahead, and somewhat less promising 
results have been obtained with 5 minute data.  The draft technical 
report has been sent to the Research Office for review.

%	.c.Fuzzy Logic Ramp metering.;  This project will move toward 
developing the neural network forecasting and fuzzy logic control system 
including in depth testing using models and on the existing SC&amp;DI 
system.  If budget and time allows the system will be implemented within 
this project.  This project is just starting.  

%	.c.SWIFT - Seattle Wide-area Information For Travelers.;  (Larry 
Senn, Mark Haselkorn, Dan Dailey)  This project is a $7.4 million IVHS 
Operational test of an FM sideband data system which will be used to 
deliver traffic and transit information.  Data will be extracted from 
WSDOT's freeway ramp control computer, Metro Transit's vehicle location 
system, and augmented with information from Metro Traffic Control.  The 
information will be formatted and sent to Seiko Telecommunication System 
for transmission to devices.  The devices include a watch (or pager) 
based on Seiko's Message Watch, Delco Electronics' Telepath car radio 
that includes a GPS to give distance and bearing to a destination, and a 
palm top computer that will be supplied by IBM which will provide bus 
locations and graphic displays of traffic conditions.  Etak will supply 
geo-coding, mapping, and data entry interfaces.  The test will occur in 
1996 after the devices are programmed and developed.  
The contract With the SWIFT project team was signed on January 10, 1995 
and work has commenced.  An evaluation plan from SAIC was submitted at 
the March 14 Steering Committee meeting and was accepted by the team with 
minor changes.  The UW team is working extensively on the network 
required to deliver SWIFT information.  This project is proceeding on 
schedule.  

%	.c.SWIFT Smart Traveler:  (Larry Senn, Dan Dailey)  This project 
is a companion to the SWIFT project and will allow ad hoc ridesharing 
amongst UW employees.  The large employer base combined with the 
availability of desktop computers and the campus network should allow for 
greater number of ride matches than found in previous projects.  Web 
pages have been created, the server is being set up, and geocoding has 
started to establish rideshare locations.  

%	.c.NEXRAD: NEXt Generation Weather RADar.;  (Larry Senn, Tom 
Seliga)  This project is investigating potential applications for the new 
doppler weather radar in transportation.  The potential uses of accurate 
short term weather predictions include better maintenance scheduling and 
transit operation improvements from early snow warnings, wind warnings 
for ferries, and for research into the traffic impacts of inclement 
weather.  
The investigators have obtained a disdrometer to assess the distribution 
of drop sizes in the region, are developing an algorithm for tracking 
storms, have arranged for data access from the weather radar, and have 
obtained a SUN workstation for use in the project.  Phase 2 of this 
project has been funded and will continue the work.  There will be no 
report for Phase 1 as it was a preliminary investigation.  

%	.c.Increasing Awareness of Transportation Options Through 
Riderlink.;  (EldonJL.JJacobson)  This FHWA/FTA Operation Action Program 
project intends to develop a Metro database infrastructure that can be 
used to make transit information (and other information) available at 
selected work sites.  Originally the intent was to team up with US. West 
Community Link's planned videotext service (The original project was 
titled: Increasing Public Awareness of Transportation Options Through 
Videotext).  Since the videotext service has been delayed or abandoned, 
the use of videotext was replaced by planning on using existing computer 
networks of some of the employers in the Overlake area between Redmond 
and Bellevue.
Metro assigned Catherine Bradshaw to coordinate the project.  Initial 
planning and coordination work began in March, 1994.  A detailed 
evaluation plan dated June 21, 1994, has been submitted.  Quarterly 
reports are being submitted.  The following three documents are 
available: Concept Document, Requirements Document, and Evaluation Plan.  
I have been able to access the Riderlink initial data pages from my 
office over the Internet.  During January, 1995, Metro publicized the 
project and made Riderlink available on a World Wide Web site on the 
Internet to disseminate the information to existing networks at employer 
sites.  All the Overlake TMA sites have connections to Riderlink.  As of 
the end of February, 1995, nearly 4,000 people from all over the world 
have accessed Riderlink.  Metro has continued to include more bus 
schedules and route maps in the Riderlink system.

%	.c.Community Transit Arterial System Area-Wide Priority (CT 
ASAP);  (EldonJL.JJacobson)  This is the IVHS operational test project 
that was earmarked by congress for Snohomish County (Community Transit).  
A proposal was submitted in February, 1994, to DC. requesting $1,500,000 
in Federal funds (75%) which will be matched with $375,000 in Community 
Transit funds (25%).  This project plans to implement the most cost 
effective portion of the Community Transit Arterial HOV study, which was 
completed in March, 1993.  That means installing a bus priority system at 
about 100 traffic signals in Snohomish County.  The North Seattle ATMS 
project will utilize the data and METRO will install the same signal 
priority system on SR 99.  This will be the first large scale area-wide 
test of a signal priority system (Pierce Transit has jumped into the 
forefront of testing signal priority, and may have a different signal 
priority system operational in Tacoma around March, 1995).
The proposal was approved and an agreement between FHWA and WSDOT has 
been drafted by FHWA.  At a coordination meeting on May 10, 1994, it was 
decided to combine this project with part of the SR 99 signal project, so 
as to only have one signal priority project within Snohomish County 
(Metro does not have authority to do any work outside King County).  The 
WSDOT-FHWA Cooperative Agreement was approved on June 17, 1994.  WSDOT 
Northwest Region is preparing the Local Agency Agreement between WSDOT 
and Community Transit.  The Local Agency Agreement has been sent to 
Community Transit.  The project may be revised in how it is coordinated 
with two other related projects in the area (the SR 99 project and the 
Metro AVI purchase project).  
As of March, 1995, the Local Agency Agreement is close to being 
finalized.  Larry Ingalls of CT is developing a work plan for the 
project.  Installation of hardware on the buses is dependent on the Metro 
region wide AVI purchase project.

.c.Additional ITS Projects

%	.c.Regional Automated Trip Planning.;  (Wayne Watanabe) King 
County Metro is participating with Community Transit and Pierce Transit 
in the development of a regional transit trip planning system.  The 
system will allow any information operator at any of the three agencies 
to enter origins and destinations within the region.  The system will 
automatically produce a trip itinerary including travel times, fares, and 
transfers.   Current effort is focused on developing geographic 
information system (GIS) hardware and software capability in Pierce and 
Snohomish counties.  King County is nearly done with its GIS component.  
This project is scheduled to be complete in 1997.

%	.c.Regional Ridematch.;  (Roland Bradley) King County Metro is 
participating with Community Transit and Pierce Transit in the 
development of regional ridematching software.  The system will allow 
ridematch staff at any of the three agencies to enter ridematch requests 
into a regional database.  This system will replace an existing regional 
ridematch system that limits the ability of agencies to offer geographic 
information system based matches, match maps for customers, and on-line 
ridematching.  The project is scheduled to be complete in 1997.

%	.c.Regional Ridematch Hotline.;  (Roland Bradley) This project 
will provide one 1-800 telephone number for anyone in King, Snohomish, 
and Pierce counties to use for ridematch assistance.  This project is 
scheduled to be complete in 1996.

%	.c.Regional Fare Integration Project.;  (Candace Carlson) King 
County Metro is participating with Community Transit, Pierce Transit, 
Everett Transit, Kitsap Transit, Washington State Ferries, the RTA, PSRC, 
and the Cascadia Project to provide seamless regional fare media that 
makes it easier to make inter-county trips within the Puget Sound 
region.  The project team is currently evaluating several technologies 
including smart cards and magnetically encoded cards.  The analysis phase 
will conclude in 1995 and a demonstration of the selected technology will 
be in place by the end of 1996. 

%	.c.Smart Bus.;  (David Cantey) King County Metro is beginning the 
implementation of a smart bus strategy that will integrate electronic 
information systems on-board buses.  The current order for 360 buses 
includes J-1708 wiring which will provide the backbone of the "vehicle 
area network."  J-1708 is an SAE standard developed and adopted by ITS 
America.  A contractor has been hired to integrate the automatic 
passenger counting systems and automatic vehicle location systems on 
board the 10% of the current fleet that have APC systems installed.

.c.other Projects

%	.c.Traffic Congestion Monitoring-Urban Areas.;  (Bill Legg or 
Mark Hallenbeck) There are three basic objectives for this study.  (1) 
Develop a comprehensive understanding of the congestion monitoring needs 
and expectations of local, state, and federal governments and agencies.  
(2) Define the alternative methods for performing that monitoring 
function.  (3) Develop cost and staffing estimates that can be provided 
to state officials in decision package form, so that a monitoring system 
based on one of these alternatives can be implemented.
This project will provide a resource document that lists the potential 
methods for monitoring congestion in the state's urban areas.  It will 
describe the types of data that need to be collected, the strengths and 
limitations of each of the methods or combinations of methods that can be 
used for collecting those data, and preliminary costs for implementation 
of those data collection procedures.  The project will provide 
descriptions of both systems that can be implemented using currently 
available technologies, and those systems that rely on technologies that 
are currently experimental but may provide greater levels of information 
gathering at a lower cost than traditional methods, if the new methods 
are implemented on an urban scale.
The Phase 2 draft report is being revised to reflect comments received 
from review.

%	.c.ENTERPRISE.;  (Bill Legg )  The ENTERPRISE Program represents 
an international forum for collaborative research, development, and 
deployment ventures.  This forum will facilitate the sharing of 
technological and institutional experiences gained from the IVHS programs 
conceived and initiated by each participating entity.  The cooperative 
and collaborative objectives of the ENTERPRISE Program provide for a more 
efficient use of resources than a series of independent initiatives.  The 
synergistic effect of this forum is an accelerated implementation of IVHS 
programs.  Current members of ENTERPRISE aside from WSDOT include; CDOT, 
AzDOT, MinnDOT, IDOT, MichDOT, NCDOT, Maricopa County DOT in AZ. FHWA, 
Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, Transport Canada, and 
Rijkswaterstaat (Netherlands DOT). Others considering joining are NYDOT, 
and the Federal DOT of Mexico.  ENTERPRISE holds quarterly meetings, in 
1994 that will be changed to 3 times a year.  The last meeting of 
ENTERPRISE was held in April 1994.  The next meeting will be in 
September, 1994 followed by a December 1994 meeting to be held in 
Seattle.  I have notes as well as minutes of previous meetings.  In 
conjunction with the September meeting ENTERPRISE will cosponsor the 2nd 
annual Rural IVHS conference with IVHS America.  The first Rural IVHS 
conference was held in February, 1993, it was sponsored by ENTERPRISE.  
ENTERPRISE is the major backer of ITIS, which is the development of an 
international standard for communications between the roadside and 
vehicles.  ENTERPRISE is also working on joint funding of several project 
proposals submitted by member organizations.  One project that is 
currently underway is HERALD, which is investigating using an AM 
sub-carrier to deliver road and construction information to motorists in 
rural areas.  ENTERPRISE submitted two proposals to FHWA as demonstration 
projects; the first is a second phase of the HERALD project, the second 
is a wide scale MAYDAY project.  FHWA accepted both of these projects for 
funding, they are now just getting underway; the interagency agreements 
and contracts are being developed and signed by the involved parties.  
Since WSDOT is a partner in a second funded MAYDAY operational test we 
will be working closely with ENTERPRISE to avoid duplication in effort 
and to share information.  I will use this report to provide updates on 
the ENTERPRISE operational tests.
The latest meeting for this group was held in Phoenix in April.  The next 
meeting will be in Minnesota in September in conjunction with the 1995 
Rural ITS conference.  The 1996 rural ITS conference will be held in 
Spokane, WSDOT will be the host agency.

%	.c.Accident Risks Using Roadway Geometrics.;  (Eldon L. Jacobson, 
Fred L. Mannering)  The work is being done by John Milton, a WSDOT 
graduate student.  The primary objective of this project is to test the 
statistical validity of the accident prediction method WSDOT is 
developing and utilizing.  The findings of this research will be used to 
develop a weighted equation for use in the Department's safety program.  
The data has been collected and most of the literature review has been 
completed.  Development and testing of accident frequency models began at 
the end of December, 1994.

%	.c.Advanced Transportation Technology Application Policy Plan.;  
(Bill Legg) This effort is looking at establishing ITS, or in this case 
Advanced Transportation Technology, as a new policy area in the 
Transportation Policy Plan for Washington State.  The first subcommittee 
meeting on this effort will be held on July 11th.  A second meeting will 
be held in August.
