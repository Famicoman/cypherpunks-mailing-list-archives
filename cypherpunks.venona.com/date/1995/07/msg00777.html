&gt; There are many crypto-anarchy applications as well:

&gt; Key cracking.  If you can write a key-cracker and keyspace fetcher in
&gt; Java,  then people can join key cracking efforts as easily looking up
&gt; an URL.  It  may not be nearly as efficient as the highly optimized C
&gt; versions used in the  current RC4-40 efforts, but there's going to be
&gt; millions of potential workers  this way.  If you were charging money
&gt; to break keys (or you were looking for  keys that are very valuable
&gt; to you), you could set up the worker client to  accept e-cash for in
&gt; return for searching keyspace "Click here to earn money  while you
&gt; aren't using your machine..."   Ensuring that workers are actually
&gt; searching the keyspace and other implementation details is left as an
&gt; exercise for the reader.
&gt;
&gt; e-instrument or information exchanges, with Java interfaces for bidding,
&gt; buying, selling, etc...

i think i prefer the idea mentioned previously on the list where it
works pretty much like a lottery. you could operate it in one of two
ways. if the encrypted data was particularly valuable to its owner
and was willing to put up a reward for the key, there would be an
incentive for people to spend idle time running through keyspace.

if it was structured as a reward, no money need be paid until the key
is found.

it could also be set up more like a traditional lottery where you
'buy' x amont of keyspace and if you hit it, all e-cash collected
would go to you. there would be many problems with running this.
nothing could keep someone from just running keys on their own in the
hope of hitting it, then buy the keyspace that contains it if he got
a hit. if the keyspace were allocated sequentially, and the person
looking for the key only paid to the person who initially 'purchased'
the keyspace, the person who got it could advertise for the person
who got the space, although this would be problematic.

if someone really wanted to do this, it would be _much_ easier to
just run the operation similar to what was performed here in
cypherpunks recently with the person who first reports the hit
getting a reward of some amount, less a modest amount for the
person/group coordinating the effort.

if someone wants a key and is willing to pay someone


DataHavens, which would probably require complex (internally) software to use.

I'm sure the online casino people are salivating over the prospects too...

Basically any fancy crypto application that requires a custom client to
operate...  Since its platform independent, efforts will be put to better use
as well.
