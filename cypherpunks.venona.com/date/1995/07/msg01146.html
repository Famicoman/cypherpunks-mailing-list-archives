Veracity suspect, but an interesting crypto story nonetheless...

&gt;Subject: Tech support story (fwd)
&gt;
&gt;---------- Forwarded message ----------
&gt; [Urban legend of the day...]
&gt;
&gt; Subject: Stressful tech call
&gt; To: Customer Service; TechSports
&gt;
&gt; This falls into the "Why did it have to happen on *MY* shift?" category.
&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine is a chief engineer at SuperMac, and he related this
&gt; story to me.
&gt;
&gt; SuperMac records a certain number of technical support calls at random,
&gt; to keep tabs on customer satisfaction.  By wild "luck", they managed to
&gt; catch the following conversation on tape.
&gt;
&gt; Some poor SuperMac TechSport got a call from some middle level official
&gt; from the legitimate government of Trinidad.  The fellow spoke very good
&gt; English, and fairly calmly described the problem.
&gt;
&gt; It seemed there was a coup attempt in progress at that moment.  However,
&gt; the national armoury for that city was kept in the same building as the
&gt; Legislature, and it seems that there was a combination lock on the door
&gt; to the armoury.  Of the people in the capitol city that day, only the
&gt; Chief of the Capitol Guard and the Chief Armourer knew the combination to
&gt; the lock, and they had already been killed.
&gt;
&gt; So, this officer of the government of Trinidad continued, the problem is
&gt; this.  The combination to the lock is stored in a file on the Macintosh,
&gt; but the file has been encrypted with the SuperMac product called Sentinel.
&gt; Was there any chance, he asked, that there was a "back door" to the
&gt; application, so they could get the combination, open the armoury door,
&gt; and defend the Capitol Building and the legitimately elected government
&gt; of Trinidad against the insurgents?
&gt;
&gt; All the while he is asking this in a very calm voice, there is the sound
&gt; of gunfire in the background. The Technical Support guy put the person on
&gt; hold. A phone call to the phone company verified that the origin of the
&gt; call was in fact Trinidad.  Meanwhile, there was this mad scramble to see
&gt; if anybody knew of any "back doors" in the Sentinel program.
&gt;
&gt; As it turned out, Sentinel uses DES to encrypt the files, and there was
&gt; no known back door.  The Tech Support fellow told the customer that aside
&gt; from trying to guess the password, there was no way through Sentinel, and
&gt; that they'd be better off trying to physically destroy the lock.
&gt;
&gt; The official was very polite, thanked him for the effort, and hung up.
&gt; That night, the legitimate government of Trinidad fell.  One of the BBC
&gt; reporters mentioned that the casualties seemed heaviest in the capitol,
&gt; where for some reason, there seemed to be little return fire from the
&gt; government forces.
&gt;
&gt; O.K., so they shouldn't have kept the combination in so precarious a
&gt; fashion. But it does place, "I can't see my Microsoft Mail server"
&gt; complaints in a different sort of perspective, does it not?
&gt;

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
