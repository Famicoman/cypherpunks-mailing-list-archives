&gt;&gt; 		 ATF SUMMER CAMP A HOTBED OF RACIAL HATE
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The Washington Times (7/11/95) reports that despite a pending lawsuit 
&gt;&gt; against the ATF for racism, a summer camp for ATF agents called the 
&gt;&gt; "Good O' Boys Roundup" was still awash with racist sentiment. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All who attended were welcomed at the entrance with many racist signs,
&gt;&gt; including one that read: 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;                         "Nigger Check Point" 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The ATF camp maintains a whites only policy. All black ATF agents who
&gt;&gt; attempted to attend were turned away. White agents inside were reportedly
&gt;&gt; "real mad" about the attempts of black agents to attend. That the signs
&gt;&gt; were hung at the entrance indicates that all who attended had no problem
&gt;&gt; with the ATF's promotion of hard-core racism at the retreat. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There were many T-shirts promoting racial hatred and murder on sale at the
&gt;&gt; ATF summer camp, such as one with a target superimposed over the face of
&gt;&gt; Martin Luther King Jr. It would seem that the ATF approves of the killing
&gt;&gt; of Dr. King. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Also available at the ATF hate camp were "Nigger Hunting Licenses." 
&gt;&gt; If promoting the murder of black leaders is not bad enough, ATF agents
&gt;&gt; even promote random killings of blacks. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; In a vain attempt to distance the ATF from the promotion of racial hate
&gt;&gt; and murder at the ATF summer camp, ATF spokesman Earl Woodham claimed the
&gt;&gt; event has never been sanctioned by the ATF. However, for years the local 
&gt;&gt; ATF office has been the place to send in registration fees and to call 
&gt;&gt; for info about the ATF summer hate camp. The agents at this office declined
&gt;&gt; to say if they ever attended one of the "round ups" over the years. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; One ATF official said "I am not surprised about the signs or other
activities 
&gt;&gt; [at the camp]."  A former law enforcement officer who has attended the 
&gt;&gt; camp this year and in the past said, "The roundup has been a place for law
&gt;&gt; enforcement personnel to go and let their hair down." So it would seem that
&gt;&gt; hatred and a lust for murdering oppressed people reflects the true nature
&gt;&gt; of these "law enforcement" personnel. "Jack-booted thugs" is soft-balling it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The pending lawsuit launched by 15 plaintiffs charges that KKK information
&gt;&gt; and "Nigger Hunting Licenses" have been displayed in many ATF offices. The
&gt;&gt; suit also claims widespread racial slurs and harassment by ATF personnel.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All information presented here is derived from The Washington Times
&gt;&gt; (7/11/95) front page article "Racist ways die hard at lawmen's retreat."
