exmh is quite good as well.  It automatically decrypts/verifys PGP messages it 
see, and when it sees a key, it adds it to your ring (and displays it as the 
listing of the key).  If you get a message that you don't have a key for, It 
puts a button at the top of the message to "Query Keyserver," which will send 
a message off to a key server for that key.

It includes menu items for all the standard PGP-ish things you'd want to do to 
a message, including inserting keys from your public ring.  It's also very 
adept at handling MIME messages intelligently.

The downside is that you need mh and tcl/tk installed on your system first.

For non-graphical mailers, emacs with mailcrypt is very good.
