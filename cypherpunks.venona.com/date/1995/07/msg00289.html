&gt;CHECKFREE AND CYBERCASH JOIN FORCES TO DELIVER COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONIC COM
&gt;
&gt;       Consumers can conduct Internet transactions using checks,
&gt;                       credit cards or cash
&gt;
&gt;    BOSTON, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Checkfree Corporation and CyberCash,
&gt;Inc. announced today at the Interactive Services Association conference
&gt;that they will cooperatively develop and market products and services
&gt;that will allow consumers to safely conduct payment transactions, in
&gt;real time, over the Internet using credit cards, debit cards, checks or
&gt;cash.
&gt;    Checkfree, the nation's leading provider of electronic commerce
&gt;services, will license technology from CyberCash, a leader in secure,
&gt;end-to-end Internet payment systems.  Checkfree will integrate
&gt;CyberCash's high level security features and ability to conduct cash
&gt;transactions into the Checkfree Wallet(TM), creating a single solution
&gt;for electronic payment transactions that offers checks, credit cards,
&gt;cash, coin or micropayments.
&gt;    "Partnering with CyberCash was the logical choice for Checkfree,"
&gt;says Pete Kight, founder and CEO of Checkfree.  "Checkfree is committed
&gt;to leading the way for electronic commerce, and providing plug and play
&gt;Internet transaction solutions.  The Checkfree Wallet(TM) is now an even
&gt;more attractive transaction platform for both consumers and merchants."
&gt;    The Checkfree Wallet(TM) was introduced in April to allow consumers
&gt;to purchases goods and services from on-line merchants in a safe,
&gt;convenient and familiar manner.  The Checkfree Wallet(TM) does not
&gt;require prior registration with merchants, and on-line shoppers pay no
&gt;fees or transaction service charges.  With the addition of CyberCash's
&gt;technology consumers will be able to utilize cash securely over the
&gt;Internet and merchants will receive authorization in real time.  In
&gt;addition, merchants will be able to accept payments from any on-line
&gt;consumers, regardless of the server or browser they are using.
&gt;    "Checkfree's long, successful record of developing applications for
&gt;home banking and electronic bill payment is a perfect complement to
&gt;CyberCash's secure Internet transaction and electronic cash expertise,"
&gt;said Magdalena Yesil, vice president of marketing for CyberCash.
&gt;"Together we can offer a complete array of payment tools that allow
&gt;consumers to conduct spontaneous transactions and pay bills via the
&gt;Internet."
&gt;    Checkfree and CyberCash will focus on developing products that can
&gt;be easily integrated into any browser system and merchant server.  The
&gt;new Internet transaction product offering, which will be co-branded by
&gt;Checkfree and CyberCash, is scheduled for release this fall.  The
&gt;product will initially be available free-of-charge via NetCom's
&gt;NetCruiser Internet browser as well as other leading Internet browsers.
&gt;Merchant interest to date also includes ID Software, the developers of
&gt;Doom(TM).
&gt;
&gt;    About CyberCash
&gt;    CyberCash, Inc. of Reston, Virginia, was founded in August 1994 to
&gt;partner with financial institutions and providers of goods and services
&gt;to deliver secure Internet payment systems.  The CyberCash approach is
&gt;based on establishing a trusted link between the seeming unpredictable
&gt;world of cyberspace and the traditional banking world.  CyberCash serves
&gt;as a conduit through which payments can be transported easily, safely
&gt;and instantaneously between buyers, sellers and their banks.
&gt;    The CyberCash system operates on top of any general security system
&gt;such as SSL or Secure HTTP.  CyberCash beta software is currently
&gt;available free-of-charge and can be downloaded from the company's WWW
&gt;server at <A  HREF="http://www.cybercash.com">http://www.cybercash.com</A>.  The company's initial service that
&gt;accepts payments using any major credit card is scheduled for full
&gt;commercial deployment this summer.  Electronic cash services are
&gt;expected by the end of 1995.
&gt;    CyberCash's principal founders, Bill Melton and Dan Lynch, have
&gt;brought together a team with unparalleled experience in credit card and
&gt;debit card automation, internet telecommunications and security.  In
&gt;April, CyberCash was chosen by Interactive Age as one of the 100 Best
