I found Grabbe's essay sufficiently interesting to forward, but all I
did was forward it.  If you have questions, you will do better to 
address them to: kalliste@delphi.com

&gt; &gt;    Allegations Regarding Vince Foster, the NSA, and
&gt; &gt; 	 Banking Transaction Spying, Part IX 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 		  by J. Orlin Grabbe
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; July 23, 1995
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Gregory Wierzynski
&gt; &gt; Assistant Staff Director
&gt; &gt; U.S. House of Representatives
&gt; &gt; Committee on Banking and Financial Services
&gt; &gt; 2129 Rayburn Building
&gt; &gt; Washington, D.C. 20515
&gt; &gt; 202-225-7502
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dear Mr. Wierzynski:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you for email letter, a copy of which is attached.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not sure why you think my quoting selections from Mr. Jim Norman 
&gt; &gt; necessarily implies endorsement or acceptance of them on my part.  I have, 
&gt; &gt; of course, quoted many, many selections from Mr. Norman, so perhaps you 
&gt; &gt; could be more specific with respect to the ones you are concerned about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps I could be of assistance to your inquiries among the spooks, if 
&gt; &gt; only you could describe to me which points you have investigated, and how 
&gt; &gt; you have investigated them. I certainly wouldn't want to promote anything 
&gt; &gt; that, as you say, "flied in the face of facts."  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I am greatly concerned about the use by Alltel 
&gt; &gt; Information Services (formerly Systematics) of a libel attorney, 
&gt; &gt; Charles O. Morgan, in an attempt to intimidate journalists and destroy 
&gt; &gt; the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And I am also gravely concerned about the possible leak of U.S. codes 
&gt; &gt; and nuclear secrets to a foreign power, which is an issue of *real* 
&gt; &gt; national security concern to the U.S.  (Of course you and I both know 
&gt; &gt; that "national security" is often used to hide the truth about sell-outs 
&gt; &gt; of national security from the American people, by clamping a lid on 
&gt; &gt; the discussion or reporting of things that are common knowledge among 
&gt; &gt; U.S. military and security agencies, and even common knowledge to the 
&gt; &gt; general public of the foreign power to which these secrets have been 
&gt; &gt; compromised.)   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Before reading my email, and your letter, I sent you a copy of "Part VIII:  
&gt; &gt; Allegations Regarding Vince Foster, the NSA, and Banking Transactions 
&gt; &gt; Spying".  There you will see from the quotes that the theft of U.S. 
&gt; &gt; nuclear secrets by Israel is openly discussed in Israeli newspapers, so 
&gt; &gt; I am sure that this is not one of the "off-the-wall" issues to which 
&gt; &gt; you are referring.  (With respect to that issue, I suggest that you do 
&gt; &gt; some investigation in Tel Aviv.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With respect to money laundering I am not concerned,  for reasons I have 
&gt; &gt; indicated in my essay "The End of Ordinary of Money",  Parts I and II,  
&gt; &gt; a copy of which I previously provided the Committee.  The money-laundering 
&gt; &gt; laws ought to be abolished, but in the meantime I do find the selective 
&gt; &gt; enforcement of these laws troubling.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With respect to "Chuck in Kentucky", I know more than one Chuck in Kentucky,
&gt; &gt; so perhaps you could be more specific which Chuck you refer to.  What stories 
&gt; &gt; did he tell you, and how is it that they didn't pan out?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since you have already spoken to both Jim and Chuck, I am taking the liberty 
&gt; &gt; of sending a copy of this letter (and your letter) to Jim Norman, and to one 
&gt; &gt; possible Chuck you may be referring to, so that perhaps they can explain to 
&gt; &gt; me their failing to satisfy you as to the accuracy of their information.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now, Mr. Wierzynski, I would like to bring up an issue about your Committee's 
&gt; &gt; behavior that is troubling me.  I am sure that there is an innocent 
&gt; &gt; explanation that I am missing. You will recall the meeting that I had with 
&gt; &gt; you and Mr. Stephen Ganis, the Counsel to the Committee, at the Four Seasons 
&gt; &gt; in Georgetown on Monday, June 12, 1995.  Two days previously I had been 
&gt; &gt; playing volleyball in the Mall with Dana Rohrbacher and Jack Wheeler and some 
&gt; &gt; others, and I had pulled most of the muscles in my right ankle.  So I 
&gt; &gt; asked everyone I was meeting to come over to the hotel, and you and Mr. Ganis 
&gt; &gt; graciously consented.  We met in the Four Seasons lounge, where I was the 
&gt; &gt; only person not wearing shoes.    
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You told me that, more than money laundering in Mena, Arkansas, you were 
&gt; &gt; interested as to whether there were any documents connecting Vince Foster 
&gt; &gt; to Systematics, or whether I knew the name of any Systematics programmers 
&gt; &gt; that may have worked to modify the PROMIS software to spy on banking 
&gt; &gt; transactions.  I told you I couldn't recall seeing any such documents, and 
&gt; &gt; that I had come across the name of one programmer, but I had subsequently 
&gt; &gt; forgotten it.  It was a pleasant meeting, so to be helpful I gave you a 
&gt; &gt; copy of Jim Norman's *Fostergate* that had been spiked from *Forbes*.  
&gt; &gt; "Why would Steve Forbes kill the article?" you asked.  I said I didn't 
&gt; &gt; know, but that--since you appeared to know Steve Forbes--you should call 
&gt; &gt; him yourself.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now, much to my surprise, I find that the following happened:  Just as 
&gt; &gt; *Media Bypass* was about to run Jim Norman's article *Fostergate*, they 
&gt; &gt; received a letter from Charles O. Morgan, indicating grave consequences 
&gt; &gt; if they were so foolish as to print the article. Mr. Morgan claimed to know 
&gt; &gt; what was in the article, because, he said, he had received a copy from Mr. 
&gt; &gt; Stephen Ganis of your Committee!  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am bothered by the fact that while you alleged to me you were investigating 
&gt; &gt; Systematics that at the same time you are passing along information to 
&gt; &gt; Systematics.  I am sure there is an innocent explanation.  But consider this:  
&gt; &gt; what if I had given you Foster-related documents and the names of Systematics 
&gt; &gt; programmers?  Would these have been passed along to Mr. Morgan also?  As you 
&gt; &gt; know, a number of people connected to this whole business have died violent 
&gt; &gt; deaths in Arkansas.  (Of course, I understand some of them had already been 
&gt; &gt; paid off to keep their mouths shut, and didn't, and so--under any standard of 
&gt; &gt; morality--deserved what they got.)  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, things are never what they appear, so perhaps you can clear things up 
&gt; &gt; for me. Please pass along my concern to Mr. Ganis, and tell him I will be 
&gt; &gt; glad to sit down with him and have a drink, or share a line, and have a frank 
&gt; &gt; discussion about this issue. (I have nothing against the use of any drug, if 
&gt; &gt; used in moderation, and in the appropriate context.) 
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Orlin

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Orlin --
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We're reading your stuff with interest. Thank you for including me in your 
&gt; &gt; list of recipients; I pass the material on to my boss and my colleagues on 
&gt; &gt; the Committee.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am somewhat surprised, however, that you accept the Norman piece without 
&gt; &gt; raising any questions about its sources. We've talked to Jim and tried to 
&gt; &gt; check out the sources he thought he could share with us. We have also done 
&gt; &gt; a fair amount of investigating on our own using the resources available to 
&gt; &gt; us--by which I mean officials inquiries to the spooks. So far we draw a 
&gt; &gt; complete blank. Worse, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that 
&gt; &gt; Jim's piece is pretty much off-the-wall. Worse still, it appears to fly in 
&gt; &gt; the face not just of facts, but simple logic as well. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I haven't, by any means, given up on this subject, but pursuing a trail 
&gt; &gt; grown cold is difficult to justify when you're paid by the taxpayer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you have suggestions on how we could verify some of the elements in the 
&gt; &gt; Norman story? I've talked to Chuck in Kentucky and am still in touch with 
&gt; &gt; him. But his stories have not panned out, even partially. I would be most 
&gt; &gt; interested in your ideas. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best regards. 
&gt; &gt; Greg
