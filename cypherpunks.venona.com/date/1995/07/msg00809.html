          Allegations Regarding Vince Foster, the NSA, and 
                Banking Transactions Spying, Part VII

                        by J. Orlin Grabbe
        
        It has come time to talk of Vince Foster and virtual 
        realities.

        1.  One type of virtual reality immersion takes place every 
        evening with respect to network news.  One sits in a familiar 
        chair, and watches familiar faces on familiar channels telling 
        soothing or alarming things about other parts of the world--other 
        realities--of which the viewer has no experience, all of it 
        demonstrated by reality-simulating sound bites and video clips.  

        The virtual reality construction is good if the story sounds 
        plausible.  That is, after all, the job of a TV reporter:  
        to tell a plausible story and to entertain our eyes by looking 
        good while telling it.  
        
        The pulp magazine reporter, on the other hand, must tell 
        a plausible story and keep it lurid enough to grab our 
        imagination.  Take the allegedly important question of "child 
        porn on the Internet," recently paraded forth by *Time* 
        magazine.  To the computer-impaired, pedophilia might serve 
        as a plausible explanation why anyone would sit for hours in 
        front of a computer screen. Never mind that the neighborhood 
        Internet-user says differently: you can't take the word of a 
        pedophile can you?  
        
        The Internet-user, on the other hand, may believe that rock 
        videos are a more reliable guide to reality than *Time* 
        magazine.  And even if he were actually interested in porn, 
        he might find life easier by going to the local video store 
        where a single video tape could store as much graphical infor-
        mation as could be stored on 2000 digital compact disks.

        2.  Another type of virtual reality is found in the banking
        world.  Money is data stored in a computer.  This money
        is "transferred" place to place by changing the ownership
        labels associated with the data.  Once the computer receives  
        the proper transfer authorization codes, the money can be
        "launched" from one bank to another, from one account to  
        another.  All that is necessary is that one properly
        emulate the reality that is important to the bank computer.

        If you include all the right digital indicators that make it 
        plausible to the computer that you are the authorized transfer 
        person for, say, the account owned by C. Jefferson, the computer 
        will believe you. It won't care about non-virtual reality--what
        C. Jefferson looks like, or what her tastes in clothes are-- 
        nor will the computer have metaphysical doubts to cause it to 
        hesitate in its actions before sending the money on its way.  
        "You" are nothing more than a preselected set of codes.
        
        In the version of Jim Norman's article *Fostergate* published in 
        *Media Bypass* (August 1995), it is stated:  
        
        "For months, a small cadre of CIA computer hackers known as the
        Fifth Column, armed with a Cray supercomputer, had been monitoring
        Foster's Swiss account. . . . Foster was just one of the first
        of scores of high level U.S. political figures to thus have their
        secret Swiss accounts looted of illicit funds . . . . Over the
        past two years . . . more than $2 billion has been swept out of 
        offshore bank accounts belonging to figures connected to the 
        U.S. government with nary a peep from the victims or their
        banks."
                
        Where did the money in the accounts come from?  Jim Norman doesn't 
        say.  I assert that some of this loot is defense and arms dealing 
        payola; some of it is drug dealing profits or payola; and some of
        it is payola from the floating fortune left by a forgotten oil man--
        whose money moves from bank to bank in a merry-go-round to keep 
        its location hidden from the potential heirs.

        And some of the loot was paid in an attempt to allow one nation 
        to become a VIRTUAL NUCLEAR POWER.
                                
        3.  Missile launches take place in a virtual reality.  Given 
        the proper launch code, the missile will attempt to go to its 
        programmed destination without further theological debate.
                
        A country possessing the launch codes and also targeting infor-
        mation for *another* country's nuclear missiles could become a 
        virtual nuclear power. (The targeting information would be as
        important as the launch codes.  For before you launched a missile, 
        you would first want to know where it is going. After all, it 
        could be aimed at you.)  Getting your nuclear arms this ways would 
        have obvious economic advantages: someone else would foot the 
        military bill.

        Jim Norman states in *Fostergate*:  
        
        "According to a heavily-redacted New Mexico FBI counter-
        intelligence report, Maxwell was apparently allowed to sell
        two copies of PROMIS back to the U.S. weapons labs at
        Sandia and Los Alamos, for what Inslaw claims was a hugely
        inflated price of $87 million.  That would have allowed
        Pollard, if he was using the rigged program, to obtain U.S.
        missile targeting data long before Israel had its own
        satellite capability, thus making it a real nuclear threat
        to the Soviet Union."
        
        Well, yes, it could make Israel a real threat to the Soviet 
        Union.  But not from Israel's own puny missile program.  
        Rather, Israel could be a threat to the Soviet Union because it 
        would be able to launch our (U.S.) missiles at the Soviet Union.

        Being a virtual nuclear power would mean not having to say you 
        are sorry.  If a U.S. missile were launched at Russia, the defense 
        system of Russia would, in its virtual view of the world, see the 
        missile as coming from the U.S.  It would launch a retaliatory 
        strike against the U.S., because in its reality only the U.S. could 
        be responsible.  It wouldn't be programmed to recognize "Missile 
        from U.S. not U.S.-intended action."

        Being a virtual nuclear power means you could *blackmail people 
        in both directions*: you could blackmail the targeted city or area.  
        More importantly, you could blackmail the U.S. If the U.S. doesn't 
        go along with your demands, why, you could involve it in a nuclear 
        war in which you would be a spectator, not a participant.  The 
        U.S. would know it has more to lose than you do, so it would give 
        in to your demands.

        Vince Foster's NSA connections wouldn't give him access to such 
        launch codes and targeting data. Not even with the help of Jonathan 
        Pollard. It would take the cooperation of a small circle of 
        friends--friends with Defense and Intelligence connections.  
        People with access. People with authority.    

        Would any of the U.S.'s own Defense Department or Intelligence 
        personnel in the 1980s or the 1990s, people other than Jonathan 
        Pollard, have been involved in such a transfer of information to 
        a foreign power--whether to Israel or to anyone else?

        Surely not anyone connected to the account numbers KPFBMMBODB 
        or KPFBMMBODE held at the Union Bank of Switzerland?  Please, 
        say it ain't so.

        For if they were, the U.S. may now be facing its greatest 
        National Security threat since the Cuban Missile Crisis.  And
        that's why everyone has an interest in covering up the various 
        threads connected to the death of Vince Foster.  Some are scurrying 
        around, hoping no one will realize how bad things are before 
        the mess can be cleaned up.  Others are scurrying around, just 
        covering their asses.  It's showdown time, with no space for 
        killing all the remaining witnesses or burying all the remaining 
        evidence.  It's showdown time, and the money people thought they 
        had for ammo is missing from their Swiss accounts.

        The levels of disinformation have already been prepared.  The
        first level says Vince Foster was just a political flack who  
        committed suicide.  The next one says, yeah, he was into some
        nasty stuff like money laundering, but had no intelligence
        connections.  The next one beyond that allows him to work for
        the NSA, but not for long or in a very important position.  
        The next one allows Foster to sell some nuclear secrets to
        Israel, but that was just to accelerate their own nuclear program,
        as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. And anyway, Foster acted
        alone.  And so on, spin control all the way.  Foster, being
        dead, will have nothing to say about his many potential roles.
                                         
        But underneath all this the Powers That Be have begun to 
        comprehend that some of their own have threatened their very 
        survival.  And the Powers That Be are going to clean house with 
        a vengeance.

                        [To be continued]
