&gt;
&gt;I just received a bit of mail asking about the Zimmermann Legal
&gt;Defense Fund, which, like many folks out there, I support.  The writer
&gt;implied that he might give money because I suggest it in my sig, but
&gt;expressed questions about its legitamacy, and questioned if it's "just
&gt;someone trying to exploit the Zimmerman case"
&gt;
&gt;Could someone in the know talk about the relationship between FV and
&gt;the ZLDF? I don't like to spread misinformation, so I won't answer
&gt;based on conjectures.
&gt;


I had similar concerns last month, so I emailed the following to 
csn.net!dubois ("Philip L. Dubois")

&gt; 
&gt; Could you please inform me of the financial status of the fund 
&gt; raising for the Phil Zimmerman case?  How much money has been 
&gt; collected, and how much has been spent, and what are the future 
&gt; anticipated expenses?  I might like to contribute, but "a normally 
&gt; unreliable source" has claimed to me that something on the order of 
&gt; $50,000 has been spent, and there is not even an indictment yet.  
&gt; Is this true and is this reasonable?  Is it true that some/all of
&gt; his legal services are being done "pro bono" (I hope I got that phrase
&gt; correct, maybe I should just say "for free")
&gt; 
&gt; If you choose to reply, may I have permission to make your reply public?

I got back the following reply:
&gt; 

&gt;Mr. Hoselton--
&gt;
&gt;Since the government has not yet decided whether to indict Mr. Zimmermann,
or at least hasn't &gt;told us its decision if it has made one, we continue to
accept donations to the Zimmermann &gt;Legal Defense Fund.  I've never added up
the total amount of all donations to date, but I &gt;doubt that it would be in
the neighborhood of $50,000.  I can tell you that several lawyers &gt;have been
working on the case and that all of them but me have done so pro bono, which
means &gt;that they have not been paid.  Since I have been lead counsel and
have therefore had primary &gt;responsibility for the defense, I have not been
pro bono, at least not entirely; I have not &gt;billed for much of my time.  We
have no way of knowing how long this case will go on.  The &gt;government could
tell us today that it won't indict, in which case it will be all over, or it
&gt;could indict very soon, or it could do nothing until June of 1996 when the
statute of &gt;limitations expires.  
&gt;
&gt;You have my permission to make my reply public.

&gt;Counsel for Philip Zimmermann
