Comments added by me to Grassley's speech.

Eric Barnes
&gt;
&gt;From: ssteele@eff.org (Shari Steele)
&gt;
&gt;*****  FEEL FREE TO DISTRIBUTE WIDELY  *****
&gt;
&gt;On June 27, Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced the Anti-Electronic
&gt;Racketeering Act, S.974.  The bill was designed "to prohibit certain acts
&gt;involving the use of computers in the furtherance of crimes, and for other
&gt;purposes."  Its immediate effect, among other things, would be to
&gt;criminalize the posting of any encryption software on any computer network
&gt;that foreign nationals can access (in other words, any computer network
&gt;period).  Because of poor wording, the bill would probably also criminalize
&gt;data compression and other non-cryptographic encoding schemes available on
&gt;networks.  This includes the compression used in most of the images on
&gt;Internet user's WWW homepages, not to mention uu and binhex encoding for
&gt;transferring binary files via email, and even language encoding used to
&gt;represent non-English characters, such as the SJIS scheme for representing
&gt;Japanese characters.
&gt;
&gt;In addition, the bill seems to be directed at undermining two big fights
&gt;we've successfully waged in the past:  the Steve Jackson Games decision
&gt;against the United States Secret Service and the government's Clipper Chip
&gt;proposal.
&gt;
&gt;Re:  Steve Jackson Games -- this bill would permit the government to avoid
&gt;the notice requirements of the Privacy Protection Act if "there is reason
&gt;to believe that the immediate seizure of such materials is necessary to
&gt;prevent the destruction or altercation [very Freudian sic!] of such
&gt;documents."  Furthermore, the government could use electronic evidence
&gt;seized that had not been particularly described in a warrant if
&gt;
&gt;"the seizure is incidental to an otherwise valid seizure, and the
&gt;government officer or employee-
&gt;
&gt;   ''(A) was not aware that work product material was among the data seized;
&gt;
&gt;   ''(B) upon actual discovery of the existence of work product materials, the
&gt;government officer or employee took reasonable steps to protect the privacy
&gt;interests recognized by this section, including-
&gt;
&gt;   ''(i) using utility software to seek and identify electronically stored data
&gt;that may be commingled or combined with non-work product material; and
&gt;
&gt;   ''(ii) upon actual identification of such material, taking reasonable steps
&gt;to protect the privacy of the material, including seeking a search warrant."
&gt;
&gt;Re:  Clipper Chip -- The bill would make it a crime "to distribute computer
&gt;software that encodes or encrypts electronic or digital communications to
&gt;computer networks that the person distributing the software knows or
&gt;reasonably should know, is accessible to foreign nationals and foreign
&gt;governments, regardless of whether such software has been designated as
&gt;nonexportable."  However, there is an exception:  "It shall be an
&gt;affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the software at
&gt;issue used a universal decoding device or program that was provided to the
&gt;Department of Justice prior to the distribution."  This is essentially an
&gt;attempt to sneak the key "escrow" provisions of the Clipper scheme in
&gt;through a legislative back door.
&gt;
&gt;Fortunately, the bill does not have a very promising future.  The bill has
&gt;no co-sponsors.  It was immediately referred to the Committee on the
&gt;Judiciary, where it currently sits.  LEXIS's bill tracking report only
&gt;gives it a 10% chance of passing out of the committee.
&gt;
&gt;I thought Senator Grassley's own statement when he introduced the bill is
&gt;worth reading, so I'm attaching it here.  My favorite line is "Elliott Ness
&gt;needs to meet the Internet."  This is especially ironic in light of recent
&gt;comparisons of hysteria about "dangerous" material on the internet, and
&gt;Prohibition.
&gt;
&gt;The bill itself follows.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;----------  Senator Grassley's Statement to the Senate  ----------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the Anti-electronic
&gt;&gt;Racketeering Act of 1995. This bill makes important changes to RICO and
&gt;&gt;criminalizes deliberately using computer technology to engage in criminal
&gt;&gt;activity. I believe this bill is a reasonable, measured and strong response
&gt;&gt;to a growing problem.  According to the computer emergency and response
&gt;&gt;team at Carnegie-Mellon University, during 1994, about 40,000 computer
&gt;&gt;users were attacked. Virus hacker, the FBI's national computer crime squad
&gt;&gt;has investigated over 200 cases since 1991. So, computer crime is clearly
&gt;&gt;on the rise.
&gt;*Was this not the same Carnegie-Mellon University involved in the horrific
&gt;Time Ragazine "Cyberporn" article?  The one which will take no
&gt;responsibility for the incredibly poor research done by one of their
&gt;undergraduates?  Which seems to take no stand on proper research procedures
&gt;used by their students?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Mr. President, I suppose that some of this is just natural. Whenever man
&gt;&gt;develops a new technology, that technology will be abused by some. And that is
&gt;&gt;why I have introduced this bill. I believe we need to seriously reconsider the
&gt;&gt;Federal Criminal Code with an eye toward modernizing existing statutes and
&gt;&gt;creating new ones. In other words, Mr. President, Elliot Ness needs to
&gt;&gt;meet the
&gt;&gt;Internet.
&gt;*Being a politician, of course he considers criminality natural.  It goes
&gt;with the territory.  And like so many of them, drunk with their potential
&gt;power over the people (Dear God, let us no longer speak of "servants of the
&gt;People), attacking every single user of computers, world wide at that, is
&gt;also a "natural" response.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Mr. President, I sit on the Board of the Office of Technology Assessment.
&gt;&gt;That Office has clearly indicated that organized crime has entered
&gt;&gt;cyberspace in
&gt;&gt;a big way. International drug cartels use computers to launder drug money and
&gt;&gt;terrorists like the Oklahoma City bombers use computers to conspire to commit
&gt;&gt;crimes.
&gt;*Ah..and notice how he carefully leaves out any empirical data?  This
&gt;Board, whatever the hell it is, "has clearly indicated" something...which
&gt;just happens to fit in with Grassley's political ambitions and desperate
&gt;need to be the center of attention.  And so he raises the unfounded
&gt;"organized crime" and "terrorist" and "conspiracy" flags to frighten us
&gt;all.  And to make matters truly worse, there is no evidence or indication
&gt;that the Internet was even used in the OK City debacle, much less
&gt;encryption.  As a matter of fact, our vaunted FBI has yet to even bring an
&gt;indictment in the case!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Computer fraud accounts for the loss of millions of dollars per year.
&gt;*Mostly through the use of bank wires...not available to the rest of us.
&gt;
&gt; And often times, there is little that can be done about this because the
&gt;computer
&gt;&gt;used to commit the crimes is located overseas. So, under my bill, overseas
&gt;&gt;computer users who employ their computers to commit fraud in the United States
&gt;&gt;would be fully subject to the Federal criminal laws.  Also under my bill, Mr.
&gt;&gt;President, the wire fraud statute which has been successfully used by
&gt;&gt;prosecutors for many users, will be amended to make fraudulent schemes
&gt;&gt;which use
&gt;&gt;computers a crime.
&gt;*I can see it now.  You typed a letter on a computer?  You're dead,
&gt;buddy!!!  And anyone who happened to have received that letter, whether
&gt;involved or not, would also be guilty by association.  Good going,
&gt;Grassley.  Fine grasp of the Constitution there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   It is not enough to simply modernize the Criminal Code. We also have to
&gt;&gt;reconsider many of the difficult procedural burdens that prosecutors must
&gt;&gt;overcome. For instance, in the typical case, prosecutors must identify a
&gt;&gt;location in order to get a wiretapping order. But in cyberspace, it is often
&gt;&gt;impossible to determine the location. And so my bill corrects that so that if
&gt;&gt;prosecutors cannot, with the exercise of effort, give the court a
&gt;&gt;location, then
&gt;&gt;those prosecutors can still get a wiretapping order. And for law
&gt;&gt;enforcers-both
&gt;&gt;State and Federal-who have seized a computer which contains both contraband or
&gt;&gt;evidence and purely private material, I have created a good-faith standard so
&gt;&gt;that law enforcers are not shackled by undue restrictions but will also be
&gt;&gt;punished for bad faith.
&gt;*Oh, Dear God!  He's gonna protect us from the enforcers.  How terribly kind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Mr. President, this brave new world of electronic communications and global
&gt;&gt;computer networks holds much promise. But like almost anything, there is the
&gt;&gt;potential for abuse and harm. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this
&gt;&gt;bill and that is why I urge industry to support this bill.
&gt;*Oh, yes...let's be sure that any promise is nipped in the bud as our
&gt;sacred government, which has shown such a dandy predilection for abuse of
&gt;power through the years, is given accerss to any and all private
&gt;communications, no matter from whom or to whom.  With a Senator like this,
&gt;who needs a Fuhreur?  I hope Iowans take a long look at this idiot next
&gt;time the ballots are being cast.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   On a final note, I would say that we should not be too scared of
&gt;&gt;technology.
&gt;&gt;After all, we are still just people and right is still right and wrong is
&gt;&gt;still
&gt;&gt;wrong. Some things change and some things do not. All that my bill does is say
&gt;&gt;you can't use computers to steal, to threaten others or conceal criminal
&gt;&gt;conduct.
&gt;*And this chump is willing to flush the entire Constitution down the toilet
&gt;in order to save us all from that which can, and will, be done by many
&gt;other means.  Notice his "all my bill does", then defines what he wants us
&gt;to believe.  And this is one of the Republicans who has promised to get the
&gt;Federal government off our backs?  Oh, yes, there *is* a Santa Claus,
&gt;Virginia.  But be very careful of his hands when he gives you that fatherly
&gt;hug.  This one will rape us all if given the chance!
&gt;
&gt;Eric Barnes
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed
