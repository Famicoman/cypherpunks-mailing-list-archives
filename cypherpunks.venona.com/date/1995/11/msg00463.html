&gt;    On an unrelated topic... cypherpunks like to count bits, right?

Mmmm, sometimes we do ... &lt;g&gt;

Sometimes we even think, if I were a lil wa'bbit, where would I go hide
... especially when we do a bad Elmer Fudd impression of Bugs Bunny. &lt;p&gt;

&gt; What is the correct number of pseudorandom bits to use in a MIME
&gt; multipart separator? If the data has a line which matches the
&gt; separator, the message is corrupted.  Of course, if you can take
&gt; multiple passes through the data, you can simply verify that it does
&gt; not contain a line which matches the separator. But if you're
&gt; restricted to a single pass, then the only way to do it is to use a
&gt; randomly generated separator.

An interesting problem.  

If you are going to take multiple passes, and do top-down and bottom up
analysis, then you can't really parse on the fly. It pretty much has to be
a batch job, I think.  You have to get your data, and then check it.  You
can't simply *trust* that there is not any corruption, and pass all of
your data through. 

And if you're going to parse in a single pass, then we're back to the 
problem of monkeys sitting at typewriters and Shakespeare's sonnets.

&gt;    I figure that 128 bits should _definitely_ be enough (that's what
&gt; is in the new premail code now). Even 64 bits should ensure that it is
&gt; unlikely that anyone will ever experience message corruption over the
&gt; expected lifetime of premail. However, it makes me nervous. What do
&gt; people think?

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  

The likelyhood of corruption is not based on each past run.  It's just 
like rolling dice.  The odds of rolling boxcars is 1 in 36 (I think) no 
matter how many prior times, you've rolled boxcars.

Twenty passes doesn't influence whether you crap out or not on a single
roll.  Nothing *remembers* past performance to ensure that something
doesn't happen (or happens) many, many times in a row.  I guess, this is
why Atlantic City, Baden Baden, and Las Vegas generally do as well as they
do.
