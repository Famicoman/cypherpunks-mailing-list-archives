&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;THE LATEST NEWS
&gt;
&gt;Since the very first day that Senator J.J. Exon (D-NE) proposed censorship
&gt;legislation for the Internet, the Christian Right has pushed for the most
&gt;restrictive regulations they could think of.
&gt;
&gt;The Religious Right (which does not necessarily speak for all religious
&gt;people concerned with this issue) recently tipped their hand in a letter
&gt;to Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD) and Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-VA) requesting
&gt;a new and more restrictive net censorship proposal.
&gt;
&gt;There are essentially three new dangerous elements of their campaign
&gt;to shut down cyberspace:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;INTERNET PROVIDERS, ONLINE SERVICES, AND LIBRARIES CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR
&gt; EXPRESSION ONLINE
&gt;The Religious Right has proposed to hold anyone who provides access to the
&gt;Internet or other interactive media, including online services providers,
&gt;ISP's, BBS's, Libraries, and Schools, criminally liable for all speech
&gt;carried on the network.
&gt;
&gt;In order to avoid liability under this provision, service providers would be
&gt;forced to monitor user's electronic communications to be assured that
&gt;no "indecent" material is transmitted across their networks.
&gt;
&gt;This proposal is MORE RESTRICTIVE than the Exon Communications Decency Act,
&gt;or any other net censorship legislation currently in Congress.
&gt;
&gt;In their letter to Congress, the Religious Right says:
&gt;
&gt;	[Providers] would simply be required to avoid KNOWING violations of
&gt;	the law. [emphasis added]
&gt;
&gt;However, the "knowing" standard is vague enough that the mere knowledge
&gt;that such material exists could be sufficient to trigger criminal liability.
&gt;A single complaint or even a news report could force a service provider to
&gt;take down a web page, remove posts to chat rooms or other discussion
&gt;forums, or shut down listservs in order to avoid going to jail and facing
&gt;huge fines.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A STANDARD FOR INDECENCY
&gt;The proposals pushed by the Christian Coalition relies on the
&gt;unconstitutional "indecency standard".  Like the Exon Communications
&gt;Decency Act, the Christian Coalition seeks to regulate all indecent
&gt;speech online.
&gt;
&gt;Indecency is a broad category that includes everything from George Carlin's
&gt;"seven dirty words" to such classic novels and "The Catcher in the Rye" and
&gt;"Lady Chatterly's Lover". 
&gt;
&gt;The Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions on indecent speech are 
&gt;Constitutional only if they rely on the "least restrictive means".  Broad
&gt;indecency restrictions on interactive media do not satisfy the "least
&gt;restrictive means" test, because interactive media allows users and
&gt;parents tremendous control over the information they receive.
&gt;
&gt;Any legislation which attempts to apply an indecency restriction to the 
&gt;Internet is unconstitutional on its face.
&gt;
&gt;The Christian Coalition's proposal that relies on an indecency
&gt;restriction contemplates dumbing down every conversation, web page,
&gt;newsgroup, and mailing list on the Internet to the level of what is
&gt;not offensive to children.
&gt;
&gt;What kind of discussions between adults are possible in an arena
&gt;where everything has been reduced to the level of the Lion King?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;UNPRECEDENTED CONTROL OVER ONLINE SPEECH FOR THE FCC
&gt;The Christian Coalition would give the FCC broad jurisdiction over
&gt;cyberspace.  It would allow the FCC jurisdiction over your online
&gt;speech, and over the design Internet software, such as web browsers and
&gt;filtering programs that parents can use to control their children's
&gt;access to the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;The Internet has developed from a government project to a market-driven
&gt;economic boom for thousands of businesses.  Giving the FCC authority over
&gt;this medium would significantly hinder the growth of this new industry.
&gt;
&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
&gt;
&gt;1. The proposals from the Religious Right will literally destroy online
&gt;   speech as we know it.  The odds of stopping this are not certain.
&gt;
&gt;   There is a very real chance that this legislation will pass, and
&gt;   we will experience a period of uncertainty and chilling of speech
&gt;   while an appropriate test case attempts to reach the Supreme Court
&gt;   (should it even get there!)
&gt;
&gt;   The Religious Right has a strong grass-roots network.  We need to
&gt;   counter their energy and ensure cyberspace is not lost due to them.
&gt;
&gt;   IMMEDIATELY CALL House Speaker Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Leader
&gt;   Dole (R-KS) and urge them to oppose the Christian Coalition's
&gt;   proposal.
&gt;
&gt;   Name, Address, and Party     Phone            Fax
&gt;   ========================     ==============   ==============
&gt;   R GA Gingrich, Newt 		1-202-225-4501   1-202-225-4656
&gt;   R KS Dole, Robert            1-202-224-6521   1-202-224-8952
&gt;
&gt;   If you're at a loss for words, try one of the following:
&gt;
&gt;	Please oppose the recent proposal from the Religious Right to
&gt;	censor the Internet.  The only effective way to address children's
&gt;	access to the Internet is through parental control tools outlined
&gt;	by the Cox/White/Wyden approach.
&gt;   or
&gt;	As a religious person and a parent, I oppose the Religious Right's
&gt;	attempts to censor the Internet.  I am the best person to monitor
&gt; 	my child's access to the Internet using parental control tools
&gt;	as outlined in the Cox/White/Wyden approach.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;   If your legislator is on the conference committee, you have a chance
&gt;   to influence their vote on this issue with your power as a constituent.
&gt;   Volunteer to help educate your legislator by sending mail to
&gt;   volunteer@vtw.org.  A coalition volunteer will be in touch with you.
&gt;
&gt;   You can starting working to help spread the word in your district by
&gt;   sending this letter to five friends.  Ask them to call Dole and Gingrich
&gt;   as well.
&gt;
&gt;3. The People for the American Way (PFAW) and the American Civil Liberties
&gt;   Union are organizing a letter from ORGANIZATIONS to the Conference
&gt;   Committee to oppose the censorship provisions.
&gt;
&gt;   If you are a representative of an organization that would like to
&gt;   signon to this letter, you should contact jlesser@pfaw.org IMMEDIATELY. 
&gt;
&gt;4. We can't suggest relaxing at this point.  The stakes are too high, and
&gt;   the risk is too great.  Everything now hangs in the balance.

&gt;THE LETTER FROM ED MEESE AND THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT
&gt;
&gt;October 16, 1995
&gt; 
&gt;The Honorable Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.  Chairman
&gt;Committee on Commerce
&gt;United States House of Representatives
&gt;Washington, DC 20515
&gt; 
&gt;The Honorable Larry Pressler, Chairman
&gt;Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
&gt;United States Senate
&gt;Washington, DC 20510
&gt; 
&gt;Re: Computer Pornography Provisions in Telecommunications Bill
&gt; 
&gt;Dear Mr. Chairmen:
&gt; 
&gt;We are writing to urge the conference committee seeking to reconcile the
&gt;telecommunications bills passed by the House and Senate include in the
&gt;final bill the strongest possible criminal law provisions to address the
&gt;growing and immediate problem of computer pornography without any
&gt;exemptions, defenses, or political favors of any kind accorded to those
&gt;who knowingly participate in the distribution of obscenity to anyone or
&gt;indecency to children. While there is no perfect solution to the problem
&gt;of computer pornography, Congress could not hope to solve this problem by
&gt;holding liable only some who are responsible for the problem.
&gt; 
&gt;The recent Justice Department prosecution project targeting those who
&gt;violated federal child pornography law using America On-Line is
&gt;instructive in this regard. More than ninety individuals were targeted for
&gt;prosecution although many others, perhaps as many as 3,000 according to
&gt;one press report, were originally targeted by the Department of Justice as
&gt;potential violators of child pornography laws. Apparently due to a
&gt;shortage of investigative and prosecutorial resources, the project was
&gt;limited. Since there are insufficient resources to investigate and
&gt;prosecute but a fraction of those that are trafficking in child
&gt;pornography by computer, then there will likely be even fewer resources
&gt;available to investigate and prosecute those involved in obscenity and
&gt;indecency.
&gt; 
&gt;Thousands of individuals both in this country and abroad are regularly
&gt;placing obscenity and indecency on the Internet. It is not possible to
&gt;make anything more than a dent in the serious problem of computer
&gt;pornography if Congress is willing to hold liable only those who place
&gt;such material on the Internet while at the same time giving legal
&gt;exemptions or defenses to service or access providers who profit from and
&gt;are instrumental to the distribution of such material. The Justice
&gt;Department normally targest the major offenders of laws. In obscenity
&gt;cases prosecuted to date, it has targeted large companies which have been
&gt;responsible for the nationwide distribution of obscenity and who have made
&gt;large profits by violating federal laws. Prosecution of such companies has
&gt;made a substantial impact in curbing the distribution of obscenity, with
&gt;many such offenders going out of business altogether. So too will
&gt;prosecution of access providers which _knowingly_ traffic in obscenity
&gt;have a substantial impact, a far greater impact than just the prosecution
&gt;of a person who places one or a few prohibited images on the Internet.
&gt;Such a person could not traffic in pornography without the aid or
&gt;facilitation of the service or access providers. Indeed, if Congress
&gt;includes provisions protecting access or service providers in whatever
&gt;bill is finally passed, it is likely that most in this country who are
&gt;trafficking in indecency to children or obscenity would continue to do so
&gt;since the threat of prosecution would be minuscule, given the numbers of
&gt;those currently involved in this activity. It is also likely that those
&gt;outside our country who are engaged in these activities would continue to
&gt;do so since it would be nearly impossible to extradite them to the United
&gt;States for prosecution. Thus, unless all who knowingly participate in such
&gt;matters are subject to the law, the Internet will remain the same and
&gt;Congress will have failed in its responsibilities to the children and
&gt;families of America.
&gt; 
&gt;Federal law has traditionally assigned equal liability both for those who
&gt;commit a crime and those who aid and abet a crime. See Title 18 U.S.C.
&gt;Code Section 2: "(a) whoever [sic] commits an offense against the United
&gt;States or aids, abets, councils [sic], commands, induces, or procures its
&gt;commission, is punishable as a principle [sic]." Service or access
&gt;providers who knowingly participate in the distribution of indecency to
&gt;children or in obscenity to anyone are aiders and abettors in the
&gt;commission of those crimes and thus should have liability under any law
&gt;Congress passes. Current federal law on child pornography provides no no
&gt;exemption or defense for access providers. Thus, the child pornography law
&gt;provides a strong deterrent against trafficking in child pornography for
&gt;those who would otherwise knowingly participate in its distribution by
&gt;computer whether pedophile or access provider.
&gt; 
&gt;The changes in law which we support would not hold an access provider
&gt;criminally liable for all illegal pornography on the Internet which their
&gt;services may be used to obtain. Nor would it require that access providers
&gt;check all communications to ensure that no violations of the law are
&gt;occurring. They would simply be required to avoid knowing violations of
&gt;the law. This is an obligation imposed on all citizens. Technology exists
&gt;today for access providers, through a simple process, to target or flag
&gt;and remove files containing objectionable material.
&gt; 
&gt;We support the House-passed language insofar as it addresses obscenity by
&gt;amendment Title 18, Sections 1462, 1465, and 1467 of the United States
&gt;Code. The provision restricting transmission of indecency in the House-passed
&gt;bill, an amendment to Section 1465, is inadequate, and we urge that it be
&gt;substantially revised.
&gt; 
&gt;Attached is the specific language we support which includes the House
&gt;passed language on obscenity and includes revisions on both the House
&gt;passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 18 and the
&gt;Senate-passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 47. The
&gt;combination of these provisions, we believe, would provide effective laws
&gt;to curb obscenity and indecency on the Internet by establishing that all
&gt;who knowingly participate in the distribution or facilitation of obscenity
&gt;to anyone or indecency to children would be subject to the law.
&gt; 
&gt;Thank you for your concern and attention to this matter.

&gt;--------------------------
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Section 1465 of Title 18, United States Code, is amended to punish
&gt;distribution by computer of indecent material to minors by adding at the
&gt;end the following:
&gt; 
&gt;Whoever knowingly communicates, transmits, or makes available for
&gt;communication or transmission, in or effecting interstate or foreign
&gt;commerce an indecent communication by computer to any person the
&gt;communicator or transmitter believes has not attained the age of 18 years
&gt;of age, knowing that such communication will be obtained by a person
&gt;believed to be under 18 years of age, shall be fined under this title or
&gt;imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
&gt; 
&gt;TITLE IV -- OBSCENE, HARASSING, AND WRONGFUL UTILIZATION OF
&gt;TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY
&gt; 
&gt;SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE
&gt;         This title may be cited as the "Communications Decency Act of
&gt;1995".
&gt; 
&gt;Sec. 402. OBSCENE OR HARASSING USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES UNDER
&gt;THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934
&gt; 
&gt;Section 223 (47 U.S.C. 223) is amended --
&gt;   (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting in lieu of [sic]:
&gt; ``(a) Whoever--
&gt;    ``(1) in the District of Columbia or in interstate or foreign
&gt;communications --
&gt;        ``(A) by means of telecommunications device knowingly--
&gt;          ``(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and
&gt;          ``(ii) initiates the transmission of,
&gt;     any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
&gt;     communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or
&gt;     indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass
&gt;     another person;
&gt;         ``(B) makes a telephone call or utilizes a
&gt;     telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or
&gt;     communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and
&gt;     with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person
&gt;     at the called number or who receives the communication;
&gt;         ``(C) makes or causes the telephone of another repeatedly
&gt;     or continuously to ring, with intent to harass any person at
&gt;     the called number; or
&gt;         ``(D) makes repeated telephone calls or repeatedly
&gt;     initiates communication with a telecommunications device,
&gt;     during which conversation or communication ensues, solely to
&gt;     harass any person at the called number or who receives the

&gt;     such activity,
&gt; 
&gt;  shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more
&gt;  than two years, or both.''; and
&gt; 
&gt;   (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
&gt; 
&gt; ``(d) Whoever--
&gt;       ``(1) knowingly within the United States or in foreign
&gt;     communications with the United States by means of
&gt;     telecommunications device makes or makes available any
&gt;     indecent communication in any form including any comment,
&gt;     request, suggestion, proposal, or image, to any person under
&gt;     18 years of age regardless of whether the
&gt;     maker of such communication placed the call or initiated the
&gt;     communication; or
&gt;       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility
&gt;     under such person's control to be used for an activity
&gt;     prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
&gt;     used for such activity,
&gt;  shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more
&gt;  than two years or both.
&gt;      ``(e) Defenses to subsections (a) and (d), restrictions on 
&gt;     access, judicial remedies respecting restrictions for
&gt;     persons providing information services and
&gt;     access to information services--
&gt;      "(1) It is a defense to prosecution that a person has complied
&gt;     with regulations designed to restrict access to indecent
&gt;     communications to those 18 years old or older as enacted by the
&gt;     Federal Communications Commission which shall prepare final 
&gt;     regulations within 120 days of the passage of this bill. Until
&gt;     such regulations become effective, it is a defense to
&gt;     prosecution that the person has blocked or restricted access
&gt;     to indecent communications to any person under 18 years
&gt;     of age through the use of verified credit card, adult access
&gt;     code, or adult personal identification number (PIN).   
&gt;     Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to treat
&gt;     enhanced information services as common carriage."
&gt;       "(2) No cause of action may be brought in any
&gt;     court or any administrative agency against any person on account
&gt;     of any activity which is not in violation of any law punishable
&gt;     by criminal or civil penalty, which activity the person has taken in
&gt;     good faith to implement a defense authorized under this section or
&gt;     otherwise to restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to,
&gt;     a communication specified in this section.
&gt;     (f) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any State or
&gt;     local government from enacting and enforcing laws and regulations
&gt;     which do not result in the imposition of inconsistent obligations on
&gt;     the provision of interstate services.  Nothing in this subsection
&gt;     shall preclude any State or local government from governing conduct
&gt;     not covered by subsection (d)(2)."
&gt;     (g) Nothing in subsection (a), (d), or (e) or in the
&gt;     defenses to prosecution under (e) shall be construed
&gt;     to affect or limit the application or enforcement of any other
&gt;     Federal law.
&gt;     (h) The use of the term 'telecommunications device' in this
&gt;     section shall not impose new obligations on (one-way) broadcast
&gt;     radio or (one-way) broadcast television operators licensed by the
&gt;     Commission or (one-way) cable services registered with the
&gt;     Federal Communications Commission and covered by obscenity and
&gt;     indecency provisions elsewhere in this Act.
&gt; 
&gt;Sec. 403. OBSCENE PROGRAMMING ON CABLE TELEVISION.
&gt; 
&gt;        Section 639 (47 U.S.C. 559) is amended by striking "10,000" and

&gt;		Managers Amendment and the CDA from the Telecommunications
&gt;		Deregulation bill
&gt;Aug  4, '95	House passes HR1555 which goes into conference with S652.
&gt;Aug  4, '95	House votes to attach Managers Amendment (which contains
&gt;		new criminal penalties for speech online) to
&gt;		Telecommunications Reform bill (HR1555).
&gt;Aug  4, '95	House votes 421-4 to attach HR1978 to Telecommunications
&gt;	 	Reform bill (HR1555).

&gt;		Empowerment Act" (HR 1978) as an alternative to the CDA.
&gt;Jun 21, '95     Several prominent House members publicly announce their
&gt;                opposition to the CDA, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA),
&gt;                Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).
&gt;Jun 14, '95     The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm
&gt;                reform bill (S 652) by a vote of 84-16.  The Leahy bill
&gt;                (S 714) is not passed.
&gt;May 24, '95     The House Telecomm Reform bill (HR 1555) leaves committee
&gt;                in the House with the Leahy alternative attached to it,
&gt;                thanks to Rep. Ron Klink of (D-PA).  The Communications
&gt;                Decency Act is not attached to it.

&gt;                bill by Sen. Gorton (R-WA).  Language provides some provider

&gt;Feb 21, '95     HR1004 referred to the House Commerce and Judiciary
&gt;committees
