&gt;&gt; I suspect this will unfortunately help. Stockholders are interested in 
&gt;&gt; profits, not principles. Co-oping with the feds will help Netscape get to 
&gt;&gt; the commercial market sooner, and most customers, sadly don't give a damn 
&gt;&gt; about privacy (or don't understand).
&gt;
&gt;&lt;Rant mode on&gt;
&gt;Clipper and family are vampires; shine some light on them and they're dead.
&gt;Witness the public ridicule of the FBI 1% scheme. Compare that to the near
&gt;mainstream silence about DT. The last round of Clipper was wonderful, for 
&gt;a while in '94 we had Time sounding like Brock Meeks.
&gt;
&gt;If Jim Clark really does mean this nonsense then I hope he does a Dorothy 
&gt;Denning and takes his show on the road (sorry Jeff). This is simply 
&gt;easy fodder for journalists without a story, totally black and white 
&gt;cheap shot at the gov. While people don't give a damn about their privacy, 
&gt;they sure do get mad when they're shown how easy it is to take away. 
&gt;They *hate* hearing the $ cost.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe some of the people on this list with higher profiles than myself should
&gt;start defending Clipper and GAK as loudly and stupidly as possible. I've 
&gt;grown dead tired of trying to get anyone around me interested in pgp,
&gt;remailers and whatnot. Reverse psycho sounds a lot easier:
&gt;
&gt;"Noted counterterrorism expert Timothy May was quoted on Connie Chung Live 
&gt;last night as saying "Clipper, GAK and CTHULHU666 are a hundred billion 
&gt;dollar investment in your national security. Only through complete wiretapping 
&gt;will we save our nation's children from violent cigarette smokers, tax 
&gt;cheaters, unlicensed pit-bull owners, Tax 'n Spend Liberals, murderous Nation 
&gt;of Islam Dope Pushers, audiophiles, christians, fat people, OJ and 
&gt;jaywalkers on the infohighway." -USA Today" 
&gt;
&gt;(Apologies. You may now killfile me with a clear conscience.)
&gt;
&gt;If you can't beat 'em, subvert 'em.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
As a _very_ low profile member of this list I thought a futile gesture
was needed at this point:
                        *I agree with you*
I've been trying to interest the  BBC in the U.K. in pgp, clipper et al 
for ages - I give up!.- BTW- after 'Britland' MPs posted hear a while back
I thought _maybe_ we'd hear more.Will the last one to leave Grate Britain
please switch out the lights!
