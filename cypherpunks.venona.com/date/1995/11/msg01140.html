Several people have asked for this. You might want to email him to ask
if the offer is still open, since this was a while back.

From: Bruce Schneier &lt;schneier@winternet.com&gt;
Subject: Applied Cryptography, 2nd Edition: Ordering Information
Date: Sun, 17 Sep 1995 18:09:34 -0500 (CDT)

The SECOND EDITION of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY is coming in November. 
This is a major rewrite: 50% more words, 7 more chapters, and
over 1600 references.  Not only did I make corrections to the
first edition and add developments since it was published, but I
also included topics left out of the first edition.  (See table
of contents--attached.)

The second edition has lots of new algorithms (including GOST,
Blowfish, RC4, and A5), more information on the Clipper Chip and
key escrow, dozens of new protocols, more information on how PGP
works, detailed information on key management and modes of
operation, and new source code.

The second edition will be published in paperback and hardcover. 
Right now I am making both available at a 15% discount.
