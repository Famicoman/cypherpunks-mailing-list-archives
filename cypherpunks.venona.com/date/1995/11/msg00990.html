&gt; &gt;  Is anyone else getting lots of junk e-mail lately? I'm getting all
&gt; &gt;kinds of direct marketing crap to both of my main accounts and I haven't
&gt; &gt;posted to usenet in months.
&gt; 
&gt;    On a related note, Compuserve had a note on their system last week from
&gt; the sysop.  Their customers are receiving unwanted e-mail advertisements
&gt; from the Internet.  Compuserve sysops are attempting to block the spaming
&gt; but are finding it difficult because the advertiser is coming in via
&gt; different routes.  They are also attempting to stop them using the court
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt;    The advertiser, according to the Compuserve sysop, threatened a
&gt; mail-bombing if Compuserve tried to block them!!!  This would be a just
&gt; cause to call in the CSOF (Cypherpunk Soldier of Fortune) for a "measured
&gt; response".

Yes, I've noticed these as well.  One troubling thing I noted with one
such spam-handed "attack" was the use of a group of internal email
addresses (in the sense that we don't advertise these addresses) as
addressees for a message that had an analog sent to www-buyinfo and
some other web related addresses.  This seems to indicate a way of
organizing lists into sets based on location/topic, but doesn't
include all other potential addressees in the same domain or
organization.

I guess it was only a matter of time before someone wrote
sophisticated spamming servers that somehow capture/analyze log files,
or is this just some idiot front end that lets ad-happy fools spam
with a smaller apparent footprint?

By the way... One reply I got from an ISP re: one of these drive by
spammings indicated that they were charging the idiot for disobeying
policy.  I've started suggesting to ISPs that they dis-user and charge
the offender (in case they haven't thought of this yet).  If non-spam
policies were more widely used, and these idiots loose their
email/access and a few hundred dollars in charges for wasting ISP
admin time, perhaps this trend won't continue.
