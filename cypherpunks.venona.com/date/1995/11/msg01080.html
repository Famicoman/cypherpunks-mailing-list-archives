&gt; Mandarins were involved in the genesis, certainly, both of our little 
&gt; college network, and of the military's arpanet.  The mandarins provided
&gt; our subsidies, and some of them found ways to use the net in doing their
&gt; academic work.  Very many of them ignored us.  

Or tried their uptmost best to ... until we came a knocking.

&gt; Among us paid computer staff,
&gt; the mandarins held occasional blue-sky meetings to plot the future and
&gt; standards for the future; the lifers went about their business of feeding
&gt; hollerith cards to the mainframes; and the talents immediately set about
&gt; exploring this orthogonal new quirk of their machine.  All the edges were
&gt; rough in the beginning, and for a long time after the beginning.  

Gee, I thought, err ... uhhm, shoot, aren't we still at the beginning??

Not the very beginning, but the beginning.

Wasn't all of the NII stuff simply a true mandarin plot^H^H^H^H
scheme^H^H^H^H^H^H contingency to get enough money to continue
"The Project" during some very lean budgetary years? 

Or am I behind in my reading again ...

&gt; Network
&gt; code arrived in huge inspired chunks from our eccentric talents.  Other
&gt; talents, staff and user alike, would go out to play on the network and
&gt; find little suggestions for the eccentric talents responsible.

All talents are by definition _irresponsible_.  They have to be in order
to take the risks, sometimes some very silly risks in hindsight. 

&gt; I think the early networks were less than satisfying for the mandarins.

A satisfied mandarin??  Hmmm.  That'll take a couple of cycles to 
compute. ;-)

&gt; It required arcane mandarin accounting schemes to rationalize our
&gt; perpetual defecits, even in a 'funny money' accounting world.

Well, they've saved my butt (I think) when someone hung up the phone on
me. 

And for this, they've certainly got *some* of my allegiance.  ;-)

And they have my gratitude.

&gt; Policies and standards were strained by the sudden accessibility of 
&gt; the foreign operations, under alien chains of command.  The networks
&gt; were immediately untidy and required compromise from the user.
&gt; 
&gt; The biggest contribution from the mandarins, and I mean this with 
&gt; all gratitude, is that they chose, again and again, not to shut us down.

Chin. chin.

&gt; ObCrypto: we were still getting the bugs out of rot13 back then.

Ahh, before they broke the code on what a baker's dozen REALLY was all
about.  Way back in the days when one-half was still working on rot12.



Alice de 'nonymous ...

                                  ...just another one of those...
