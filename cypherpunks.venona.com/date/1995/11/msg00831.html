I keep telling you people.. if you keep giving Fred the attention, he
is never going to go away. Its blindingly obvious that he doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground, but if you keep telling him that,
its just going to encourage to post more, post more frequently, and
make a bigger fool of himself then he already has. Just ignore
everything he says. Make a proc-mail script to send his mails to
/dev/null or sends them through the text-to-hick filter. But whatever
you do, do *not* send him money, do *not* feed him, and *never* *ever*
no matter how much he begs, nt matter how much he pleads, *NEVER*
reply to this man's messages.

We need one of those little posters like the "Do not takes checks from
this man" ones in the grocery store.

&gt; &gt; 3.  Postscript considered dangerous:   (insert-smiley) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for the question of someone invoking a postscript interpreter via a
&gt; &gt; browser and thus opening up their system to some rogue postscript
&gt; &gt; file: I think it would be great if either of these two things were to
&gt; &gt; magically happen:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	1) people would stop putting postscript docs on web pages
&gt; &gt; 	because it's the wrong technology for WWW - it wastes
&gt; &gt; 	bandwidth - it's hard to view &amp; hence often ugly - everyone
&gt; &gt; 	just prints it out anyway and then complains because there
&gt; &gt; 	is no one "standard" implementation of postscript printing
&gt; &gt; 	worldwide and there are dozens of minor problems
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	2) someone could implement a secure postscript previewer
&gt; &gt; 	(whatever that means!) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I doubt either of those two things will happen.  The average Jo on the
&gt; &gt; internet needs to understand that when s/he downloads binary files
&gt; &gt; over the internet and run them from insecure programs on their local
&gt; &gt; computer, well, s/he runs some risk.  This risk might be tiny, but
&gt; &gt; it's impossible to quantify loss.  If I lose a poem that I'm writing,
&gt; &gt; to me that's priceless, so I do not intend to imply that loss of data
&gt; &gt; isn't tragic for the person who loses it.  If you have data you can't
&gt; &gt; bear to lose, be sure to practice safe computing.  Perform backups
&gt; &gt; regularly, and use judgement about which interpreters and executable
&gt; &gt; programs you allow to run on your PC.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; It seems clear from this that Netscape, or at least Marianne who seems
&gt; to speak for Netscpe, doesn't understand the protection issues that my
&gt; clients face.  I will nevertheless forward this official Netscape line
&gt; to them so they can better understand why I tell them it is insecure.
