 &gt; Post Office offers Internet digital ID

 &gt; Certification authority a key enabler of electronic commerce

 &gt; By Gail Bronson

 &gt; Side bar WASHINGTON - Come next summer, the U.S. Postal Service
 &gt; expects to be up and running with a service that will identify
 &gt; senders and receivers of Internet messages, a critical enabler of
 &gt; electronic commerce.

 &gt; Specifically, the Postal Service will operate a certification
 &gt; authority for public-key certificates used to digitally sign
 &gt; messages transmitted over the Internet.

 &gt; The Postal Service expects the service to be of particular interest
 &gt; to anyone involved in electronic commerce or electronic data
 &gt; interchange, in which the ability to assure the identity of both
 &gt; the sender and receiver of information can be crucial.

 &gt; "Right now there is no way to figure out if messages on the
 &gt; Internet have been tampered with nor is there any way to
 &gt; authenticate the genuine identity of a sender," said Paul Raines,
 &gt; program manager for electronic commerce at the Postal Service. "It
 &gt; could be a dog on the other end of the Internet now for all you
 &gt; know."

 &gt; Limited beta tests of the Postal Service's system already are under
 &gt; way within the federal government, at the Federal Aviation
 &gt; Administration, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service.

 &gt; "We're eager to work with VeriSign [RSA Data Security Inc.
 &gt; spin-off] and any other certification authorities to come up with
 &gt; ways to help with cross certification," Raines said. "We're not in
 &gt; this to compete with private companies, rather, we're trying to
 &gt; enable [the electronic commerce] industry."

 &gt; Some users may find the Postal Service certification authority
 &gt; service more appealing than private alternatives because its
 &gt; service will carry the weight of law - tampering with Internet
 &gt; messages would be as much a crime as tampering with regular U.S.
 &gt; mail. On the other hand, there is always the lingering concern of
 &gt; having to deal with a federal bureaucracy.

 &gt; The Postal Service intends to play two roles in the certification
 &gt; business.

 &gt; First, as a certifying service the federal agency will provide the
 &gt; code, or public-key certificate, necessary for recipients of
 &gt; digitally signed messages to identify the sender. This service will
 &gt; be necessary to decrypt mail unless the two correspondents
 &gt; previously exchanged their keys privately. Second, the Postal
 &gt; Service will maintain a server to manage a public register of
 &gt; public-key certificates accessible off the Internet, Raines said.

 &gt; The Postal Service will conduct market studies to gauge demand
 &gt; before deciding how much individuals must pay to obtain someone
 &gt; else's public key certificate. In addition, the Postal Service will
 &gt; sell for less than a dollar an electronic date-time stamp to prove
 &gt; the existence of a message in a particular point in time.

 &gt; "We're taking the same attributes of hard copy that make them
 &gt; legally binding and transferring them to electronic
 &gt; correspondence," Raines said.

 &gt; The Postal Service is working with several companies, including
 &gt; Premenos Corp., to develop the necessary software, Raines said. The
 &gt; user agent and interface specifications for designing software to
 &gt; interface with the Postal Service's server, however, are available
 &gt; free to any one willing to sign a licensing agreement, Raines said.

 &gt; Regardless of how such arrangements work themselves out, the Postal
 &gt; Service intends to operate this business on a nonprofit,
 &gt; self-supported basis. "We don't intend to have first-class mail
 &gt; supporting Internet mail," Raines said.
