I strongly disagree with Mr. Hallam, but I am replying in private
mail. This is far off the topic of the list.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Hold on.  This is more "factoid" than "fact":  recall that income is PAID 
&gt; &gt;&gt;by people as well as EARNED by people.  Most payers have easily 
&gt; &gt;&gt;detectible physical presence and assets that can easily be attached by 
&gt; &gt;&gt;regulators.   It will be a cold day before, e.g., my employer agrees not 
&gt; &gt;&gt;to report my earnings.  And the same is true for most employers in most 
&gt; &gt;&gt;industries.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, this is true, at least for people whose employers are
&gt; &gt;subject to income tax somewhere.  Taxing businesses doesn't make sense
&gt; &gt;economically - you could collect almost as much money with far less disrupti
on
&gt; &gt;to the underlying economy by taxing it as wages for workers and
&gt; 
&gt; Why unfortunately? I happen to consider that our modern social ecconomy
&gt; is a high point of civilisation. It is certainly a tremendous achievement.
&gt; We can educate the entire population, provide them with health care,
&gt; prevent famine and provide protection against crime and agression by
&gt; other states. All in all rather a good deal.
&gt; 
&gt; While one might wish to personally avoid paying taxes there are no benefits i
f 
&gt; everyone avoids paying taxes. There are significant areas of the ecconomy
&gt; which can only be funded through social mandates, roads for example.
&gt; While there are fringe political elements who put forward alternative models
&gt; I find them no more convincing than the claims of the Marxists who made
&gt; similarly ideologically based assertions not so long ago. There have at 
&gt; least been examples of Marxist states, even though they were not particularly
&gt; successful and rapidly degenerated into dictatorships.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I find the libertopian obsession with government oppression and complete
&gt; indifference towards coporate exploitation unsatisfactory. The truth is
&gt; that both are inevitablty interlinked. For the "libertarian" it is 
&gt; unsatisfactory for the government to exploit consumers of utilities but
&gt; entirely satisfactory for corporations to do so should they have the chance.
&gt; The theoretical possiblity of competition making this acceptable even
&gt; where there is no actual competition and hence no choice. This 
&gt; corprativist model accepts supression of freedom provided it is to
&gt; commercial goals.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the linkage between direct mail advertising and surveilance. It
&gt; is unecconomic for a government to trace the movements of every citizen.
&gt; The communist countries were brought down as much by the cost of the huge
&gt; surveilace administrations they constructed as anything else. In the
&gt; West we do not have government surveilance, we have direct mail marketers
&gt; do the job for government. Surveilance is made ecconomic by getting the
&gt; citizen to subsidise it. It is naturally open for the government to apply
&gt; information collected by these people for their own purposes. It is a 
&gt; salable commodity and the government is a willing buyer. Furthermore there
&gt; is a sophisticated infrastructure in place to achieve these ends.
&gt; 
&gt; The extent of corporate surveillance goes unnoticed by most citizens. Few
&gt; people realise that when they use their credit card in a supermarket they
&gt; are supplying a direct mail marketing company with a profile of their
&gt; spending paterns. They are also providing a statement of where they are,
&gt; and indirectly their income, residence etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What is needed is stringent data protection laws which enforce the 
&gt; confidentiality of personal information. Note that both the SEPP and
&gt; STT payments systems conceal the credit card number from the merchant.
&gt; Cryptographic locks on individual parts of the picture are insufficient 
&gt; however. What is needed is laws which make the financing of the 
&gt; underlying architecture unecconomic.
