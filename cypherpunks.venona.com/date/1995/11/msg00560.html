I saw this on the NZ.general newsgroup and had to share it with the list. 
'fraid it's just the reply - the  original must've expired by the time 
I got there (and I couldn't be bothered to go looking for an archive to 
track it down in).

Enjoy...

&gt;&gt;Powerful national security insiders have established effective control
&gt;&gt;over the entrance gateways to the Internet. Disturbing signs are now 
&gt;&gt;emerging that the "information superhighway" has been targeted for 
&gt;&gt;systematic surveillance and political dossier-building on Americans'
&gt;&gt;opinions.
&gt;
&gt;	Oh, really?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;SAIC is a $2 billion defense and FBI contractor with a board of
&gt;&gt;directors that reads like a Who's Who of the intelligence community.
&gt;&gt;Board members include Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, the former director of
&gt;&gt;the National Security Agency (NSA) and deputy director of the CIA; Melvin
&gt;&gt;Laird, defense secretary under Richard Nixon; Donald Hicks, former head
&gt;&gt;of research and development for the Pentagon; Donald Kerr, former head
&gt;&gt;of the Los Alamos National Laboratory; and General Maxwell Thurman 
&gt;&gt;(ret.), the commander of the U.S. invasion of Panama.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The corporation also has a legion of computer network specialists and
&gt;&gt;an entire division of computer consultants. 
&gt;
&gt;		As does IBM, DEC, AT&amp;T, MicroSoft, shal I go on?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;SAIC currently holds contracts
&gt;&gt;for re-engineering the Pentagon's information systems, automating the
&gt;&gt;FBI's computerized fingerprint identification system, and building a
&gt;&gt;national criminal history and information system.
&gt;
&gt;	Nope, I believe that's DISA's job now (was DCA)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Internet is a marvel of computer softward technology. It was designed
&gt;&gt;to survive a nuclear attach on the United States--like the Post Office,
&gt;&gt;it's literally smart enough to find a way to get the mail through even if
&gt;&gt;most of the network is missing.
&gt;
&gt;	Wow, TCP/IP is a marvel?  this guy must hate Novell.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;But control of the Internet domain name registration means the ability
&gt;&gt;to remove troublesome--or outspoken--computer systems from the network.
&gt;&gt;Potentially, this control also confers the power to insinuate "phantom"
&gt;&gt;domains into the network--for surveillance purposes, for example,--or
&gt;&gt;for real-time, automatic censorship.
&gt;	So the government can wipe out all nameservers at once?  This is
&gt;geting better....
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Furthermore, anecdotal evidence gathered by this author (Matthews)
&gt;&gt;suggests that actual "truth control" is taking place on the net now.
&gt;&gt;E-mail messages with controversial contents--including details of the
&gt;&gt;SAIC takeover of domain names--have consistently disappeared as they
&gt;&gt;travel across the network. News items concerning the Vincent Foster
&gt;&gt;"suicide" investigation and allegations of NSA bank spying through
&gt;&gt;compromised Inslaw softward are being quickly and automatically 
&gt;&gt;cancelled. And the cancellations are not by their authors.
&gt;
&gt;	Must be a bad MX server somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;With domain names under the control of secret government insiders, it
&gt;&gt;is even theoretically possible that large parts of the Internet could
&gt;&gt;be shut down and silenced at critical times. This could be accomplished
&gt;&gt;by suddenly altering domain name registration or interposing compromised 
&gt;&gt;"domains" at critical points. These compromised systems could serve as
&gt;&gt;"black holes" at critical times, stopping e-mail and important news
&gt;&gt;from reaching the world -- or the rest of the country.
&gt;
&gt;	Well that means well just have to use IP addresses, right?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Exercises in "turning the Internet off" have already taken place in
&gt;&gt;Taiwan and Hong Kong. In Taiwan the 'net was successfully shut down.
&gt;&gt;All network traffic--including news, opinions, and e-mail sent by computer
&gt;&gt;users was successfully "bottled up" on the island and prevented from
&gt;&gt;reaching the world.
&gt;
&gt;		It sure is easy to cut an island off, but a continent or more?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In Hong Kong the Internet wasn't quite strangled, but the British auth-
&gt;&gt;orities who control that colony managed to throttle free electronic speech
&gt;&gt;with the rest of the world until everything was bottlenecked into a few
&gt;&gt;little-known satellite links.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;These are alarming precedents and sure signs that powerful, shadowy
&gt;&gt;forces are preparing to chop at the very roots of America's new Liberty
&gt;&gt;Tree. The secretive people on the board of directors of SAIC are intelli-
&gt;&gt;gence professionals skilled at manufacturing events--and then 
&gt;&gt;manufacturing public opinion and consent by controlling the truth. Will 
&gt;&gt;Internet disinformation, censor-ship or "shutdowns" signal the next American
&gt;&gt;crisis?
&gt;
&gt;	So, you basically said that the government is willing to cripple
&gt;itself by shutting down the Internet and MILNET.  This guy needs a
&gt;kick in the teeth or something to wake him up.  Next thing you know is
&gt;that he'l claim to be abducted but CIA agents posing as Elvis
&gt;impersonators.  And he'll start believing elis still lives.
