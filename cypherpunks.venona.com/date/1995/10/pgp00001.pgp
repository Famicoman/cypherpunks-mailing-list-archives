I am planning to do take an independent study course in cryptography.  A
professor here is interested in doing it with me, but neither he nor any
other faculty members at this school is very knowledgeable about
cryptography (hence his interest :).  I am looking for good (technical)
books on cryptography which would work well as textbooks for undergraduate
computer science majors with scant knowledge of number theory.
   Thanks in advance,
   Serge
