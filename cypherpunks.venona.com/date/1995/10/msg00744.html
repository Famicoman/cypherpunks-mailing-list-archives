C'punks,

The ideas ARE getting out there.  I don't think I'll be availing
myself of the following services, but am forwarding this FYI.

Þ OAR is dedicated to providing financial privacy and the processing of
global financial transactions. OAR will provide for your secured online
financial transactions. Your financial transactions, instructions and data
are safe from prying eyes. OAR precludes having your private email read by
hackers and snoopers on the Internet.

Þ OAR is a pioneer in using the quality encryption technique, Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP)[tm], for the receipt of instructions and for providing
confirmation of transactions and status reports to our clients.  PGP is one
of the most popular worldwide encryption techniques and has not been
breached to our knowledge. Other systems (Netxxxx) have, on two occasions,
once in France and again in California, by student hackers.

Þ Using the Internet, OAR can accept PGP instructions from our clients and
to act upon them worldwide.  OAR is situated in Nassau, centrally located
for operating in the Caribbean and Central American but is also equipped to
function in over 20 international financial centres (Isle of Man, Bermuda,
Cook Islands, Vanuatu, etc.).

Þ We can execute you financial transactions, move cash from bank to bank,
from brokerage accounts to bank, attorney, escrow account, etc. You instruct
us by PGP as to what you need accomplished. We can also provide for pass
phrases in addition to PGP which some find absolutely crucial when handling
financial transactions on line.

Þ OAR is bonded.

Þ “If you need to send an international email message containing
confidential and sensitive financial information, use OAR.”

1. Basic set-up charge of US$500.00, non-refundable.
2. Annual renewal fee of US$250.00, per year.
3. Transaction fee, US$50.00 per transaction, plus actual costs (wire
transfer fee, FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc.).  To be charged against your credit
balance which must be advanced, minimum of $100.
4. Optional mail fowarding service.  We will accept your international mail
and re-mail it with a U.S. postmark from locations in the U.S. US$240/year.
We will repackage you mail and pay for new postage.
