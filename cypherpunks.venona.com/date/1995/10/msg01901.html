I'm Cc:ing this to cypherpunks since I've gotten a lot of requests for this
information.

&gt; From: sandoval@cic.teleco.ulpgc.es (Juan Domingo Sandoval Gonzalez)
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Patrick,
&gt; Thanks for yor info about "Network Security Private Communication
&gt; in a PUBLIC World" by Kaufman, Perlman and Speciner.
&gt; To buy it I need to know Who published it.
&gt; Do you know the Editor house?
&gt; 

"Network Security - PRIVATE Communication in a PUBLIC World", 1995, Prentice
Hall PTR, ISBN 0-13-061466-1, by Charlie Kaufman, Radia Perlman, and Mike
Speciner.

This book is amazing.  It explains hard concepts in ways that make them
seem obvious.  I can't state this too emphatically.  The style of the
book is conversational, approachable and a fun read, while at the same
time maintaining technical exactness to the point that you can implement
algorithms from the discussions in this book, (and understand how they
work.)

17.6.2 Coping with Export Controls is very interesting, detailing the weird
hoops that Lotus jumped through to retain as much security as possible while
still meeting export requirements.  The authors make the point that what
happens to you when you go through this process is almost random depending
on the times as well as the individual person you deal with.

The ANS.1 section is blunt about the space problems, and indeed much of the
book is refreshingly blunt about the stupidities involved in a lot of this
stuff.

The quick proof of why the initial and final permutations add nothing to 
the security of DES is presented in an informal and quite obvious sidebar.
The comment is made that by the same argument the permutation of the key
in the generating of per-round keys also adds nothing to security.

It also includes homework and would be a wonderful textbook.

Here's an abbreviated version of the TOC.  Note that the real index is much
richer than this.  I've given the complete version of section 3.3 to
illustrate.  All typos are mine.  I think we can no longer refer to Bruce's
book as the Bible, but must refer to the two books as the Scriptures;)

Could someone refer me to some good crypto oriented math books?  Preferably
something as readable as this:)
