&gt; &gt;   Why did I know you would be showing up in this discussion?  You
&gt; &gt; wouldn't be related to alice de 'nonymous would you?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it Netscape's position that when people call them on their statements
&gt; they make irrelevant comments and inflamatory remarks toward legitimate
&gt; researchers who are freely helping them understand the security issues
&gt; they apparently don't understand?

  Perhaps that comment was out of line.  If I offended you I apologize.

&gt; &gt;   I don't believe that Netscape claims to be some magic bullet that
&gt; &gt; will suddenly make your system secure when you install it.  We also
&gt; &gt; don't claim that it will detect viruses.
&gt; 
&gt; You claim that you provide secure net access for the purposes of
&gt; transactions - which you don't - and you have gotten an enormous amount
&gt; of money from people who don't understand these issues based, at least
&gt; in part, on your false claims.  Some people might interpret that as fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; Now instead of trying to insult and put down people who have legitimate
&gt; security concerns, you personally attack individuals, try to redirect the
&gt; discussion away from the security flaws in Netscape, and try to hush the
&gt; discussion with:

  I don't see how any product could meet your definition of "secure".
I think you've made your point, and I don't agree with it.  How you
pursue the matter is of course up to you.

&gt; &gt;   Dont you think we've wasted enough bandwidth on this?  I'm sure
&gt; &gt; most readers of this list are sick of it by now.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that you should give a copy of this and the other messages on
&gt; this topic to someone at Netscape who is responsible for protection and
&gt; ask them to speak for the company and address these issues head on.
&gt; Regardless of your disclaimer, when you speak on the net, we hear
&gt; Netscape, and the sounds are starting to sound more and more like
&gt; Microsoft to me.

  If you wish to get an official statement from Netscape, you should
contact our PR department.  Their number is 415-528-2802.
