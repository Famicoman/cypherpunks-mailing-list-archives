[me]&gt; Can you elaborate WITH FACTS on the supposed weakness of MD5 ?
                        **********
I wonder what is your definition of facts...

 &gt; I didn't say that there were any weaknesses in MD5, all I said was:
 &gt; 	"unlimited trust ... (incorrectly in my view...)"
 &gt; 
 &gt; The lack of adequate demonstration of strength is not the same as a
 &gt; weakness.  It represents only a lack of adequate assurance for placing
 &gt; more than a certain amount of trust in MD5 for the purpose it is being
 &gt; used to accomplish.
 &gt; 
 &gt; As to weaknesses, I seem to remember that someone managed to forge a
 &gt; modification to a program used to observe networks on a Sun so that it
 &gt; had the same MD5 checksum as the official trusted version.  But whether
This is absolute bullshit with a probability of (2^128-1)/2^128
 &gt; this is real is not strictly the issue. 
On the contrary real things should be the issue... not random thoughts

 &gt; In the case of the trust being placed in MD5 by Netscape, the assumption
 &gt; being made (without adequate support as far as I can tell) is that an
because you can't tell 1+1=2 doesn't imply people have to worry...
 &gt; MD5 checksum cannot be forced, through a chosen plaintext attack, to
 &gt; yield checksums of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...  on up to enough primes to
 &gt; allow the known plaintext attack that gets the RSA private key used to
 &gt; authenticate messages.  As far as I am aware (and I may not be aware of
 &gt; everything) there is no reference work to support this assumption.  If
The fact that you obviously didn't take the time to do any
search/reading on the subject does not allow you to go on with mad
assumptions... 
 &gt; the assumption is wrong, then the whole SSL can fall to a selected
 &gt; plaintext attack launchable (presumably) through those general purpose
 &gt; Java aplets we have heard so much about.
FYI,  ( false =&gt; false ) is a true expression... starting from false
assumption you can demonstrate *anything*
{ if 1+1!=2, lots of things "fall"}
 [me]&gt; [btw who talked about 'unlimited' trust ?]
 &gt; There has been no limit given by anyone on this list to the level of
 &gt; trust they place in MD5.  Several people have posted (without
 &gt; contention) that MD5 is sufficiently trustworthy to trust billions of
 &gt; dollars in commerce to it's being able to prevent a selected plaintext
 &gt; attack as eluded to above.  If you think we should trust it, and you
 &gt; don't limit your assessment of trust, what other assumption should I
 &gt; make? If several people proclaim that trust and nobody stands up in
 &gt; disagreement, tacit agreement is my normal (although not necessarily
 &gt; justified) assumption. 

AGAIN, the limit is 2^128 computer operations (as I quoted from the rfc
days ago), which is imo certainly NOT the weakest part of the security
chain...

Do you actually read anything people are mailing or writing ?
&lt;/grrrrrrr&gt;

sorry again, I feel tested...
