&gt; &gt;&gt;I figure that as long as we are going to receive...
&gt; &gt;&gt;       ? a commercial message from Digex ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;We might be able to tap their knowledge base in assesing
&gt; &gt;&gt;the various risks and rewards available by using a Commercial
&gt; &gt;&gt;ISP.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;After all, with the FBI and Scientologists waging war on
&gt; &gt;&gt;the Internet ( capturing keystroaks, siezing computers,
&gt; &gt;&gt;and rummaging through everyones E-mail ), There may be a
&gt; &gt;&gt;way to make life a little more interesting for them.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I will be glad to send in my two cents worth - I am not sure that
&gt; &gt;I understand the question though.
&gt; 
&gt; While, I believe in strong crypto for everyone (what cypherpunks doesn't),
&gt; I also believe that much can be done to prevent the wholesale snooping
&gt; of Commercial ISP customers data.  I believe that this data is snooped
&gt; because the ISP's and large number of customers (ignorant of security)
&gt; make this data too easy a target (cost effective).
&gt; 
&gt; While the NSA may follow it's motto (In GOD we trust, the rest we monitor).
&gt; Others may take hostile actions agenst someone whose password or
&gt; personal information has been obtained. (ex. drain bank account, or just
&gt; send spam)
&gt; 
&gt; Some questions that I would like to ask...
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - Assuming that someone from an agengy or someone pretending to
&gt;     be from an agency wanted to capture one or all the ISP customers
&gt;     key presses.  What method would they use ?
&gt; 
&gt;     Would they capture the data at the phone company?
&gt;     Would they tap the raw data stream at the initial ISP router ?
&gt;     Would they route IP packets from the initial ISP router through their
&gt;         own equipment before arriving at the ISP maching running the shell
&gt;         account ?
&gt;     Would they use a Trojin Shell (or telnetd) on a shell account ?
&gt;     Would they inform the ISP and get his help or root access ?
&gt; 
&gt; 2 - What methods could be put into place by the ISP or it's customers
&gt;     to help prevent this snooping activity ?
&gt; 
&gt;     Perhaps an alternative login method (like deslogin or idealogin)
&gt;         trying to protect data through the phone company and IP route
&gt;         to the target machine.
&gt;     Perhaps having a crypto checksum on the shell (telnetd) to detect
&gt;         trojin software.
&gt;     Perhaps sendmail could public key encrypt mail on it's way to the
&gt;         customers directory.
&gt;     Perhaps just raising the customer awareness of security issues
&gt;         and methods at the ISP.  This could affect the mainstream
&gt;         user (joe sixpack) as well as the PGP user.
&gt;     Perhaps ISPs could offer a data archive service/site (foreign site)
&gt;         where data in the form of PGP encrypted E-mail can be saved and
&gt;         retrieved via a robot (something like majordomo).  That way,
&gt;         if your home computer breaks, burns, is stolen, or siezed. You
&gt;         can still retrieve your data at a later time.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted these methods do not prevent a determined attacker from squashing
&gt; an ISP cutomer.  However, it does raise the cost of the effort to single
&gt; out a user and attack him rather that grab cleartext from everyone.
