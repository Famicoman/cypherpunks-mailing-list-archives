   I tried to board my 15 year old son on Delta's Sky West in St George 
UT for SLC last week --they _required_ ID, and it took me almost 5 
minutes to back a very polite counter agent down from the requirement. 
   Now, maybe I am an obstructionist, but I have been foregoing the 
IRS deductions for my 5 children since I refuse to obtain SSNs for them. 
Again, that made life interesting at passport time --I entered 
000-00-0000 for the kids and passports were issued.  
   Likewise, I have had more than one hospital _try_ to refuse service for
lack of SSN. 
   At close to 300 lbs and dressed in black and concave inverter reflector
lenses, it becomes an excellent example of "...intimidation is just
another form of communication...." 
   Whether we like it or not, "they" intend to tag us --there was a very
informative article on non-intrusive scanning of the iris for
identification within the last month -not sure which rag. from "their" 
perspective, scanning the iris is far more secure than the imbedded 
chip.  Maybe we can scuttle it on disrcimination against the visually 
impaired! :)
   This topic may be relevant since crypto -probably "their" private
crypto after banning ours- will be essential to establish communications
to the central data bank somewhere under the NSA monolith or whereever... 
On the other, the list topics are too fragmented and I agree with tcm, 
futplex, etc. that we need more concentration on crypto "methods" -rather 
than speculation on what method the Feds are going to try to screw us 
over with next.

&gt; &gt;I'd be more sympathetic to arguments about an airline's right to write
&gt; &gt;it's contracts as it pleases. Though they are Common Carriers; they can't
&gt; &gt;just offer Contracts of Adhesion at will.
&gt; 
&gt; No crypto relevance--my apologies.
&gt; 
&gt; I am skeptical that the "all passengers must have picture IDs" has much to
&gt; do with identifying corpses after crashes.
&gt; 
&gt; The recent push is certainly associated with the various terrorist threats
&gt; and incidents. The FAA can push for it, and the airlines have little to say
&gt; about it.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I read--probably in the WSJ--that the airlines see this as a
&gt; chance to regain control of "ticket abuse." Corporations often have bought
&gt; up discount tickets without knowing who willl be travelling and on what
&gt; dates. This allows them to have a pool of tickets and saves them a bunch of
&gt; money.
&gt; 
&gt; Reports are that many people showed up at boarding gates with a different
&gt; name than what the ticket said, and had to pay extra to get a current
&gt; ticket (no advance purchase, of course).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what the compelling lessons are, except that the
&gt; "Identification Required State" is getting closer every day.
