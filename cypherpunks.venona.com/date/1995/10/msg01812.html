&gt; pretty steep for someone wanting to spend $.10 on something.) My
&gt; understanding is that the _bank account_ is FDIC insured, but not
&gt; the ECash. I could be wrong -- their materials are extremely confusing
&gt; and hard to follow.

	My understanding is that the accounts are "WorldCurrency
Access" accounts-- which appear to be Money Market funds, which can be
denominated in one of 25 currencies. (Ecash-linked accounts must be
denominated in dollars.) Being a money market fund, a positive return
is -not- guaranteed, and it is not FDIC insured. It is an "investment"
account, not a "savings" account. (That is my understanding, which
could very well be flawed.)

	Does anyone understand their non-merchant pricing structure?
It had me very confused. Also, what is the difference between a
merchant and a non-merchant. I saw nothing on the pages describing
that. Suppose Community ConneXion wanted to accept ecash. Could we get
a non-merchant account?

&gt; 
&gt; As one of my co-workers said today, "It will be interesting to sit
&gt; back and watch them take regulatory mortar fire." Indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really hoping that they pull their act together -- I've already
&gt; sent in my account application -- but things look really grim at
&gt; the moment. There are certainly a lot of projects list members are
&gt; working on that would be greatly enhanced by functioning, popular
&gt; e-cash. I encourage everyone to give them lots of helpful feedback
&gt; so that they can turn this around.
&gt; 
&gt; On another note, I'm hoping that some of you will also bite the
&gt; bullet, get accounts, and join me attempting to win valuable
&gt; prizes in Sameer's "Hack Digicash" promotion. I'd rather see one
&gt; of us find holes in this than see the whole thing melt into the
&gt; ground.
&gt; 
&gt; This extremely unprofessional, bungled launch does, I admit, make
&gt; Mondex (with scads of beautiful marketing literature) look better all
&gt; the time, although based on some conversations on Sunday, it appears
&gt; that they may have _extremely serious_ architectural security problems.
&gt; We'll see how things play out.
&gt; 
&gt; Later,
&gt; 
&gt; Doug
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;        With the release of digicash I hope that we can soon make this
&gt; &gt;stuff for-pay and much of the spam problem will be fixed. (Not all of
&gt; &gt;it, of course.)
&gt; &gt;        (I am rather hesitatnt to setup an account with Mark Twain
&gt; &gt;though.. $2,500 min balance and not FDIC insured?)
