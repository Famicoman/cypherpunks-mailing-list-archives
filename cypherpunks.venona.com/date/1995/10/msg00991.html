&gt;   Discovery of lnternet Flaws Is Setback for On-Line Trade
&gt;
&gt;   By John Markoff
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   San Francisco, Oct. 10 -- Newly publicized weaknesses in
&gt;   the basic structure of the Internet indicate that the
&gt;   worldwide computer network may need a time-consuming
&gt;   redesign before it can be safely used as a commercial
&gt;   medium.
&gt;
&gt;   The flaws could allow an eavesdropper or criminal to divert
&gt;   many types of documents or software programs traveling over
&gt;   the Internet, examine or copy or alter them, and then pass
&gt;   them on to the intended recipient -- who would have no easy
&gt;   way of knowing that the files had been waylaid. Not only
&gt;   could electronic mail be read in transit or credit card
&gt;   numbers be copied en route, but special security techniques
&gt;   meant to protect such transactions could be dismantled
&gt;   without the user's knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;   That such security flaws exist is not surprising in a
&gt;   system designed originally as a scientific experiment. But
&gt;   the recent rush to the Internet by companies seeking to
&gt;   exploit its commercial possibilities has obscured the fact
&gt;   that giving the system a new purpose has unearthed
&gt;   fundamental problems that could well put off true
&gt;   commercial viability for years.
&gt;
&gt;   "Companies would have you believe this is a trivial
&gt;   problem," said Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science
&gt;   at the University of California at Berkeley. "But now there
&gt;   is a financiat incentive to exploit these flaws and to do
&gt;   it secretly."
&gt;
&gt;   The problems were described in a posting that researchers
&gt;   at the university made on Monday to several on-line
&gt;   discussion groups. While the discussion groups are intended
&gt;   for computer security experts, they are potentially
&gt;   accessible to millions of Internet users -- including
&gt;   break-in artists, who are known to monitor such discussion
&gt;   groups for tips on new ways to crack computer systems.
&gt;
&gt;   The researchers who described the Internet weaknesses
&gt;   include two Berkeley computer science graduate students who
&gt;   noted a security weakness in a popular Netscape
&gt;   Communications Corporation software program last month.
&gt;   Then as now, the students' stated motivation in publicizing
&gt;   the problems was to underscore vulnerabilities facing all
&gt;   companies and customers wishing to use the Internet for
&gt;   commerce.
&gt;
&gt;   When the Netscape problems were disclosed last month, the
&gt;   company said the security flaws would be corrected in the
&gt;   next version of its software, which users would be able to
&gt;   download at no charge from Netscape's Internet site. But
&gt;   the newly publicized flaws in the Internet itself indicate
&gt;   that even if a user downloaded a copy of the new, improved
&gt;   Netscape program, a criminal could tamper with the copy
&gt;   along the way and make it unsafe for use in credit card
&gt;   transactions.
&gt;
&gt;   The problem is not Netscape's alone; it potentially affects
&gt;   any organization that operates a computer from which files
&gt;   or software could be downloaded over the Internet. The
&gt;   weakness can be traced to the technical underpinnings of
&gt;   the network, which was set up more than a quarter-century
&gt;   ago not as a medium for conducting business but as a way
&gt;   for academic and scientific researchers to exchange
&gt;   information.
&gt;
&gt;   The disclosure of the flaws casts doubt on the aspirations
&gt;   of companies like Netscape, which last summer had one of
&gt;   the most successful stock offerings in Wall Street history
&gt;   based on the promise of the impending arrival of a
&gt;   full-fledged on-line marketplace.
&gt;
&gt;   "Companies should take a step back and think about this a
&gt;   little more," said Ian Goldberg, one of the Berkeley
&gt;   students. "If it takes a bit longer but comes out more
&gt;   secure, we will all be better off in the long run."
&gt;
&gt;   The way many Internet systems are set up -- especially the
&gt;   Internet's increasingly popular World Wide Web service in
&gt;   which software images and even video and audio clips can be
&gt;   easily downloaded -- information is stored on a computer
&gt;   called a file server and then transferred to a user's
&gt;   computer when it is needed.
&gt;
&gt;   The newly publicized weakness occurs in a widely used
&gt;   Internet protocol -- or technical standard -- known as the
&gt;   Network File System, or NFS. Because NFS does not have any
&gt;   means for allowing the recipient of a program or document
&gt;   to verify that it has not been altered during transmission
&gt;   from the file server to the user, any interception or
&gt;   tampering would go undetected.
&gt;
&gt;   "The Internet protocols have been insecure since day one,"
&gt;   said Jeffrey I. Schiller, the manager of computer networks
&gt;   at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director
&gt;   of an industry task force that is trying to design a new
&gt;   secure version of the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;   But the group's timetable is uncertain, and even when it
&gt;   does have recommendations ready, Mr. Schiller is not
&gt;   optimistic that the industry will be willing to devote the
&gt;   time and money to put them into effect.
&gt;
&gt;   He said that many technologies already exist for improving
&gt;   commercial security on the Internet, but many of them
&gt;   require too much technical sophistication on the part of
&gt;   computer users. He criticized makers of hardware and
&gt;   software for not moving more quickly to make easy-to-use
&gt;   security features a built-in part of the technology used on
&gt;   the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;   "The people who should be the leaders in offering security
&gt;   have been too busy counting their money to build these
&gt;   features in to their products," Mr. Schiller said.
&gt;
&gt;   Some commercial Internet merchants have tended to play down
&gt;   the potential for harm from an illegal interception of
&gt;   credit card information over the Internet. They point out
&gt;   that consumers routinely make their credit card numbers
&gt;   available in transactions done by mail or telephone and
&gt;   that the law puts limits on a consumer's liability in cases
&gt;   of credit card fraud.
&gt;
&gt;   But Mr. Brewer, the Berkeley professor, said that the
&gt;   crucial difference in the proposed Internet commerce
&gt;   systems was that for the first time it would be relatively
&gt;   simple for a criminal to collect hundreds or thousands of
&gt;   credit card numbers. Then a thief could use each credit
&gt;   card only one time, making detection much more difficult.
&gt;
&gt;   Sensitive to heightened concerns about security, Wells
&gt;   Fargo, the large California bank, which earlier this year
&gt;   began permitting customers with personal computers to view
&gt;   their account information with the Netscape software,
&gt;   suspended the service in September after the Berkeley
&gt;   students reported the flaw in Netscape.
&gt;
&gt;   After Netscape followed with an improved version of its
&gt;   software, Wells Fargo officials found it secure enough that
&gt;   they planned to resume the service later this week. The
&gt;   bank will, however, require customers to use the corrected
&gt;   version of the Netscape program.
&gt;
&gt;   Even then. Wells Fargo customers will be able only to view
&gt;   account balances and other information, but not transfer
&gt;   money or conduct other transactions of the type that might
&gt;   leave them vulnerable to the Internet NFS weakness.
&gt;
&gt;   "We still hope to be able to offer transactional
&gt;   capabilities next year, but this has slowed us down a
&gt;   little bit," said Lorna Doubet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman.
&gt;   "Many of our customers feel that security is absolutely
&gt;   essential and we have to be cautious in this regard."
&gt;             
&gt;   Executives at Netscape said yesterday that they were aware
&gt;   of the security issues surrounding NFS and would make
&gt;   changes in the next release of their software expected
&gt;   before the end of the year to permit a recipient of a
&gt;   downloaded program to check it for signs of tampering.
&gt;
&gt;   And hoping to take advantage of the fault-finding talents
&gt;   of the Berkeley researchers and other like-minded software
&gt;   experts, the company announced a contest today called
&gt;   Netscape Bugs Bounty, in which Netscape will award prizes
&gt;   to users who find bugs or security loopholes in its
&gt;   software.
&gt;
&gt;   Some Internet experts said they expected that many security
&gt;   weaknesses like the one the Berkeley group had demonstrated
&gt;   would be found, because the Internet was simply not
&gt;   designed to insure secure commerce.
&gt;
&gt;   "Imagine a walled town or a house," said Noel Chiappa, a
&gt;   member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a
&gt;   standards-setting group. "It doesn't matter if 99 windows
&gt;   are tight as can be -- if the 100th is wide open, the bad
&gt;   guys will bypass your security. "
&gt;
&gt;   [End]
