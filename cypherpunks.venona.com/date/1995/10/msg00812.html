 &gt; &gt;just alice. From Bob's perspective, Alice is really an alias for

 &gt; 
 &gt; What difference does it make?  I'll tell you.  It means that their
 &gt; conversation is not private!  It means that their cryptography is
 &gt; useless, that it has failed.

But if by all means available Bob and Alice satisfy themselves that
their conversation *is* secure, then (until they're proven wrong) it
might as well be.  They have satisfied themselves *at least* that
their messages are in fact encrypted at some point, just as if they
walked into a room, looked around, and satisfied themselves that there
are no hidden microphones.  I don't see how you can ever do any better
than this if you're willing to imagine arbitrary powerful
men-in-the-middle.

 &gt; This is not a useful or appropriate way to think of the world, IMO.  If
 &gt; you do this, then from your perspective people become bafflingly
 &gt; unreliable.  I wrote all about this before.

Gee, in my reality people already *are* bafflingly unreliable.  (You
must not be watching enough afternoon trash talk shows.)

 &gt; Try to think of it not in relativistic or epistemological terms, but
 &gt; rather look at it in terms of reality.  The real world exists, and in it
 &gt; exist real people.  We can agree on this much, right?  Two of these
 &gt; people want to communicate securely.  That is not such a stretch of the
 &gt; imagination, is it?  By "communicate securely" I mean they exchange
 &gt; information in such a way that other people don't receive it.

What, however, is the real difference between the MITM scenario in a
purely electronic relationship, and a "phony personality in the
middle" attack on a "flesh" relationship?  You *think* you're working
with a realtor to buy a house, but in fact it's a con artist that
betrays your trust and rips you off.  You *think* you've found the
love of your life, but in reality it's just somebody who wants to use
you for sex.  There are no guarantees.

Let me ask this:  how do you *guarantee* that you're having a truly
private in-the-flesh correspondence with a person?  And, having done
that, how do you *guarantee* that the other person will behave in an
absolutely trustworthy fashion?

 &gt; Now surely it is clear that with this definition of the problem,
 &gt; approaches which redefine people to mean people+eavesdroppers are not
 &gt; responsive.  Perhaps the motivation to do so is simply the belief that
 &gt; the problem is not solvable as stated.  If so, I'd like to hear someone
 &gt; say this.

I certainly don't know how to solve it, but I wouldn't trust me if I
were you :-)
