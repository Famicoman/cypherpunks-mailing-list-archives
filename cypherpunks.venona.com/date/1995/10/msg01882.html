&gt; &gt; I believe that the laws regarding the export of crypto from the UK are
&gt; &gt; very similar to the ITAR regs in the US.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought they were markedly different!
&gt; 
&gt; I always understood there were NO restrictions on crypto export,
&gt; import or use to western countries.  There used to be COCOM agreements
&gt; which said that you should get approval to send commercially produced
&gt; crypto to some blacklisted countries (Iraq, etc).  I also read that
&gt; the COCOM restrictions did not claim to apply to free software.

I think that it was the COCOM restrictions that I was thinking about. The
blacklist was fairly large (including the USSR) and I believe that it did apply
to software (although I do not know about free software).

&gt; Anyway, I read that the COCOM agreement has expired, so none of this
&gt; applies anymore, even.

Now this I did not know. Do you know when it expired and why it was not renued?
We must still have some export restrictions for Munitions does this no-longer 
cover crypo?

&gt; &gt; However our Government seems to take the view that putting crypto
&gt; &gt; software on the net is not exporting it, the exporting is done
&gt; &gt; whenever anyone from an export restricted country downloads the
&gt; &gt; software and is done by them rather than by the person who made the
&gt; &gt; software available.

&gt; I also have heard this.

I can not remember where I heard this though. I don't suppose you know whether
this was an official policy statement or just a comment like 'well it may technically be illegal but we would hold the downloader liable rather than the
supplier'?

&gt; I think he would be safe emailing it, putting it on the WWW, or
&gt; posting it to USENET.  There are no selective access restrictions on
&gt; *any* crypto ftp/http sites that I know of in the UK (like various
&gt; ones in the US which make a sho of enforcing the export restriction by
&gt; not allowing export to non-US domain names.)
&gt; 
&gt; Adam

I do not know of any crypto sites in this country with access restrictions but
I would still probably make any software available via the WWW or an FTP site
(or maybe post it to USENET via a host in this country) rather than actively
mail it abroad... but then again I am paranoid (at least it does not involve
shipping larges pipes out of the country).
