&gt; &gt;Let me propose an alternative unique name: the public key (or a good hash
&gt; &gt;of it).  The public key has an advantage over both X.509 and PGP names.
&gt; &gt;The binding between it and its human being is testable.  You can challenge
&gt; &gt;the human in question to sign something.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand this whole discussion.  A certificate is a signed
&gt; binding of a key and a unique name, right?  If the proposal here is
&gt; that the unique name be a hash of the key, you are suggesting a signed
&gt; binding of a key with its hash!  What is the point of a certificate
&gt; which binds a key to its hash?  What is such a certificate asserting?
&gt; It seems to be saying nothing at all.  Anybody can already tell if a
&gt; hash is right, for all the good that does you.  It's like a notarized
&gt; statement that 2+2=4.  I don't see the point.  As Carl goes on to say:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Assuming you use a public key as the unique name, you end up with a much
&gt; &gt;simplified certificate.  In fact, the notion of "certificate" may go away,
&gt; &gt;in the sense that the certificate binds a key to a person through a unique
&gt; &gt;name.  The person binds himself to his key, on challenge (or on any message
&gt; &gt;signature).
&gt; 
&gt; If in fact this is just a suggestion that we not have certificates, that
&gt; may have some value.  But as a literal suggestion that certificates bind
&gt; a key hash to a key, that just doesn't make sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; The thing to keep in mind is, why do we want certificates?  Why not just
&gt; use unsigned keys?  If I encrypt a message for Carl based on some key I
&gt; found lying around somewhere which someone told me is his, and I send it
&gt; to his mailbox, and I get a reply back, how secure is that?  We all know
&gt; that you don't get the full security of the encryption if you do this.
&gt; Man in the middle attacks might not be easy to do in such a situation but
&gt; they are certainly possible.  It is such attacks that certificates (including
&gt; PGP key signatures) are designed to prevent.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to see some grounding of this discussion in terms of the role of
&gt; certificates, and ways to prevent man in the middle attacks.  I certainly
&gt; have no love for facist worldwide ID cards and hierarchical, organization
&gt; based naming schemes, but just using any old key because it seems to work
&gt; OK most of the time isn't going to fly IMO.

  I think the old idea of a certificate just binding a name and
a key is turning out to not be very useful.  That is why Netscape
Navigator 2.0 will support x509 version 3 certificates.  They allow
arbitrary attributes to be signed into a certificate.  In this new
world, you can think of a certificate as a way of binding a key with
various arbitrary attributes, one of which may be(but is not
required to be) a name.
