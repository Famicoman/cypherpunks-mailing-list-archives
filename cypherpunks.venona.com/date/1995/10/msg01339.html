&gt; Thanks for responding, Black (if I may call you Black), it means I don't 
&gt; have to.

'uni' sounds a lot less charged, but it doesn't matter much to me.
My pleasure.
 
&gt; &gt; Remember, there is an incentive for employERS as well as employees to 
&gt; &gt; flee the tax system of a nation that is manipulative of it.  Employers 
&gt; 
&gt; Also an incentive for jurisdictions to engage in a beneficial "Dutch 
&gt; Auction" in which they offer lower and lower tax rates to attract 
&gt; employers and employees.

"Race to the bottom" this is usually called by statists who dislike the 
effect.  It's also applied to things like environmental regulation, 
where (for example) many businesses in Illinois moved to Indiana when it 
became clear that Indiana was much more corporate friendly because their 
'office paper' disposal "tax" was zero, and Illinois was significant 
enough to make small business feel the pressure.  (No, I'm not kidding)  
Of course, losing the business, Illinois uped the ante and eliminated 
the tax all together and coupled it with some kind of incentive.  
Indiana countered and so forth.  Everyone won, of course, in that the 
total number of small businesses in both states outgrew economic growth over 
the period, but the leftists had a fit.  Wealth maximization is not a 
concept that is easily understoof by greedy statists who want MORE and 
want it NOW.  I am amused that this strata of market forces is 
never recognized as market forces, but just dirty nasty states shooting 
important regulation down.
