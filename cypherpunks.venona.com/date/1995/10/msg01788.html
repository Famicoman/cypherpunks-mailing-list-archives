&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It 
&gt; &gt;looked somewhat like a stream cipher that generates its key by measuring 
&gt; &gt;packet lag over TCP/IP. General consensus was that any key determined 
&gt; &gt;from public information wasn't secure.
&gt; 
&gt; It uses a new symmetric message key for each message.  The key for message
&gt; n is a function of that for message n-1 modulated by the content of
&gt; message n-1.  However, it operates at the message layer, not the TCP/IP
&gt; layer.  In a given population, everyone in the population can begin with
&gt; the same key.  As messages are exchanged between any two parties in the
&gt; population, they end up with a key which is unique to them.  The system is
&gt; synchronous.  If any traffic between two parties is lost, they must
&gt; re-synch; keys between each of the parties and other parties will not be
&gt; affected.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is novel and useful.   It will be resistant against most
&gt; attackers.  It is much less resistant to attacks by nation states that
&gt; could have a record of all traffic among all parties.  Of course it is not
&gt; an OTP nor is it more secure than other modern systems.  If anything, it
&gt; is a little less so, at least against those who have all of the traffic
&gt; and to the extent that more than two parties start with the same initial
&gt; key.  Of course, its strength is to permit all members of the population
&gt; to begin with the same key while ensuring that members of the population
&gt; are safe from each other.  It also ensures that compromise of the initial
&gt; key is not sufficient to read traffic.  One must have all the intervening
&gt; traffic.  Thus, if one comes to the party late, learning the initial key
&gt; will not enable one to read current traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;OTOH, I saw a press-release on Cypherpunks a week or two back that 
&gt; &gt;claimed Whitfield Diffie and David Kahn had both examined the algorithm 
&gt; &gt;under NDA, and both were blown away by it. OTOOH, I don't know how much 
&gt; &gt;Diffie and Kahn know about TCP/IP.
&gt; 
&gt; Diffie knows enough; Kahn less.  However, both are geniuses and know what
&gt; they need to know.  As to their being "blown away," I tend to doubt it. 
&gt; The idea is useful but not revolutionary.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;We'll know for sure when they release the details of the spec. And, if 
&gt; &gt;they go to the logical conclusion of all this secrecy and they *don't* 
&gt; &gt;release the spec, it won't be worth a bucket of warm snake oil.
&gt; 
&gt; If they have applied for a patent and if the effectiveness of the scheme
&gt; does not rely upon secrecy of the scheme, then of course there is no
&gt; reason for secrecy.  They sent me an evaluation copy of the program and
&gt; have been fairly open in discussing it.  (No one has suggested an NDA or
&gt; even that there were any secrets involved.)  While for security I would
&gt; rather have Lotus Notes or Secure Exchange, for ease of administration
&gt; this program has advantages.
&gt; 
&gt; The product is interesting and less bogus than your meters might lead you
&gt; to believe.  Few of us would like to have our products evaluated strictly
&gt; on the basis of press releases and reports.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that the scheme infringes patents of which I am aware.
