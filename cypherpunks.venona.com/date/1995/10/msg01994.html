Subject:  Hash collisions [was Re: MD5 weakness ? ...]



&gt;
&gt;&gt;As to weaknesses, I seem to remember that someone managed to forge a
&gt;&gt;modification to a program used to observe networks on a Sun so that it
&gt;&gt;had the same MD5 checksum as the official trusted version.  But whether
&gt;&gt;this is real is not strictly the issue.
&gt;
&gt;Ron has not mentioned such an event to me and if that were the case I   
would
&gt;seriously doubt that he would not have been told about it. The only   
comment
he
    

&gt;generally makes is that he wrote MD5 because "MD4 was making me   
nervous".
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In the case of the trust being placed in MD5 by Netscape, the   
assumption
&gt;&gt;being made (without adequate support as far as I can tell) is that an
&gt;&gt;MD5 checksum cannot be forced, through a chosen plaintext attack, to
&gt;
&gt;Netscape do not simply use the MD5 of the message, they are using (as I
&gt;understand it) the PKCS#1 standard for makoing the signature. If not   
they
&gt;probably have severe problems.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;There has been no limit given by anyone on this list to the level of
&gt;&gt;trust they place in MD5.  Several people have posted (without
&gt;&gt;contention) that MD5 is sufficiently trustworthy to trust billions of
&gt;&gt;dollars in commerce to it's being able to prevent a selected plaintext
&gt;&gt;attack as eluded to above.
&gt;
&gt;NIST and the NSA trusted MD4 sufficiently to base SHA upon it. SHA is
preferab
 le
&gt;in many ways to MD5, it has a different approach to extending the   
scheduling
a
 nd
&gt;resist differential cryptanalysis. There is a problem with the   
compressor
&gt;function of MD5 which I dislike. This is fairly irrelevant though since   
SSL
&gt;allows other digests to be used.
&gt;
&gt; Phill

I hesitate to jump in to this exchange given the defensive and
vague nature of the discussion, but...

While I agree that SHA seems preferable, for a number of reasons,
to MD5, it is worth noting that Hans Dobbertin of the German Information
Security Agency recently found a collision in MD4. His attack
allows you to generate a pair of plainexts that generate the same hash.
A fast technique for finding a second plaintext that hashes to some given
value remains an open problem with MD4 (and SHA and MD5, for that   
matter).

As far as I can tell the attack does not readily generalize to MD5
or SHA.
