original source to confirm/deny this.  Please pay special attention to 
anti-anon-mailer deals]

 ---------- Forwarded message ----------
This law was just passed and signed by the governor in PA.  If you look at it,
you'll notice that it makes it illegal to post instructions for making certain
things (like phreaking boxes) and it also makes it illegal to use an anonymous
remailer (conceal or assist another to conceal from any service provider).


   Amending Title 18 (Crimes and Offenses) of the Pennsylvania
   Consolidated Statutes, further providing for manufacture, distribution
   or possession of devices for theft of telecommunications services.
   
   The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts
   as follows:
   
   Section 1. Sections 910 and 3926 of Title 18 of the Pennsylvania
   Consolidated Statutes are amended to read:
   
   § 910. Manufacture, distribution or possession of devices for theft of
   telecommunications services.
   
   (a) Offense defined.Any person commits an offense if he:
   
   (1) [makes or possesses any instrument, apparatus, equipment or]
   makes, distributes, possesses, uses or assembles an unlawful
   telecommunication device or modifies, alters, programs or reprograms a
   telecommunication device designed, adapted or which can be used:
   
   (i) for commission of a theft of [telecommunications]telecommunication
   service or to acquire or facilitate the acquisition of
   telecommunication service without the consent of the telecommunication
   service provider; or
   
   (ii) to conceal or to assist another to conceal from any [supplier of
   telecommunications] telecommunicationservice provider or from any
   lawful authority the existence or place of origin or of destination of
   any telecommunication; or
   
   (2) sells, possesses, distributes, gives or otherwise transfers to
   another[,] or offers, promotes or advertises for sale [any instrument,
   apparatus, equipment or device described in paragraph (1) of this
   subsection,] any:
   
   (i) unlawful telecommunication device, or plans or instructions for
   making or assembling the same, under circumstances evidencing an
   intent to use or employ such [instrument, apparatus, equipment or]
   unlawful telecommunication device, or to allow the same to be used or
   employed for a purpose described in paragraph (1) [of this
   subsection], or knowing or having reason to believe that the same is
   intended to be so used, or that the aforesaid plans or instructions
   are intended to be used for making or assembling such [instrument,
   apparatus, equipment or device.] unlawful telecommunication device; or
   
   
   (ii) material, including hardware, cables, tools, data, computer
   software or other information or equipment, knowing that the purchaser
   or a third person intends to use the material in the manufacture of an
   unlawful telecommunication device.
   
   (b) Grading.An offense under this section is a [misdemeanor of the
   first] felony of the third degree if the person convicted of such
   offense has been previously convicted of any similar crime in this or
   any other state or Federal jurisdiction. Otherwise it is a misdemeanor
   of the [second] first degree.
   
   (c) Restitution.The court may, in addition to any other sentence
   authorized by law, sentence a person convicted of violating this
   section to make restitution under section 1106 (relating to
   restitution for injuries to person or property) or 42 Pa.C.S. §
   9721(c) (relating to sentencing generally).
   
   (d) Civil action.A telecommunication service provider aggrieved by a
   violation of this section may, in a civil action in any court of
   competent jurisdiction, obtain appropriate relief, including
   preliminary and other equitable or declaratory relief, compensatory
   and punitive damages, reasonable investigation expenses, costs of suit

   (d) Inferences.
   
   (1) Any person having possession of or access to the location of a
   public utility meter or service measuring device which has been
   avoided or tampered with so as to inhibit or prevent the accurate
   measurement of utility service and who enjoys the use of or receives
   the benefit from the public utility service intended to be metered or
   measured by the public utility meter or measuring device so avoided or
   tampered with may be reasonably inferred to have acted to avoid or
   tamper with the public utility meter or measuring device with the
   intent to obtain the public utility service without making full
   compensation therefor.
   
   (2) Any person having possession of or access to the location of the
   distribution or transmission lines or other facilities of a cable
   television system which have been tapped, altered or tampered with or
   to which any unauthorized connection has been made or to which any
   unauthorized device has been attached or any person having possession
   of or access to any device installed by a cable television system to
   which an unauthorized modification or alteration has been made, the
   result of which tapping, altering, tampering, connection, attachment
   or modification is to avoid payment for all or any part of the cable
   television service for which payment is normally required, and who
   enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the cable television
   service, may be reasonably inferred to have acted to have tapped,
   altered, tampered with, connected or attached to or modified cable
   television facilities with the intent to obtain cable television
   service without making full compensation therefor. This inference
   shall not apply to the act of a subscriber to cable television
   service, who receives service through an authorized connection of a
   television receiving set at his dwelling, in making, within his
   dwelling, an unauthorized connection of an additional television
   receiving set or sets or audio system which receives only basic cable
   television service obtained through such authorized connection.
   
   (e) Sale or transfer of device or plan intended for acquisition or
   diversion.A person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree if
   he sells, gives or otherwise transfers to others or offers, advertises
   or exposes for sale to others, any device, kit, plan or other
   instructional procedure for the making of such device or a printed
   circuit, under circumstances indicating his having knowledge or reason
   to believe that such device, kit, plan or instructional procedure is
   intended for use by such others for the acquisition or diversion of
   services as set forth in subsections (a) and (b).
   
   (f) Restitution.The court may, in addition to any other sentence
   authorized by law, sentence a person convicted of violating this
   section to make restitution under section 1106 (relating to
   restitution for injuries to person or property) or 42 Pa.C.S. §
   9721(c) (relating to sentencing generally).
   
   (g) Civil action.A telecommunication service provider aggrieved by a
   violation of this section may, in a civil action in any court of
   competent jurisdiction, obtain appropriate relief, including
   preliminary and other equitable or declaratory relief, compensatory
   and punitive damages, reasonable investigation expenses, costs of suit

   service.
   
   "Unlawful telecommunication device." Any electronic serial number,
   mobile identification number, personal identification number or any
   telecommunication device that is capable, or has been altered,
   modified, programmed or reprogrammed alone or in conjunction with
   another access device or other equipment so as to be capable, of
