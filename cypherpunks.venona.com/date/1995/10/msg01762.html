                Mark Twain Bank Launches Ecash
                ==============================

      -----------------------------------------------------
      Mark Twain Bank begins operating DigiCash's ecash(TM)
               on the Internet with U.S. Dollars
      -----------------------------------------------------

     Mark Twain Bank of St. Louis Missouri starts accepting
applications Monday October 23, 1995 for accounts that can be
used to withdraw and deposit ecash over the Internet.
DigiCash(TM) bv, of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, developer of
ecash, is supplying the technology to Mark Twain Bank under
non-exclusive license. The technology has been tested with a
'monopoly(TM) money' currency called CyberBucks(TM), but this U.S.
dollar denominated system is the first time electronic cash is
actually being offered using real currency.

     "This launch marks the beginning of a new era, one in
which the digital equivalent of paper money and coins will
become even more important than their physical precursors are
today," according to Dr. David Chaum, Managing Director of
DigiCash bv and inventor of electronic cash. "It will catalyze
enormous growth in electronic commerce on the Internet, and
prove of enduring value through its improved protection of
consumers and society at large."

     Sweden Post, another ecash licensee, owns the retail bank
that is responsible for more than 50% of value transfers in
Sweden and has direct access to accounts of over 75% of Swedish
households. Sweden Post has not yet announced its launch date.

How does it work
----------------
     Using ecash is like using a virtual ATM (Automatic Teller
Machine). When connecting to it over the Internet, you
authenticate ownership of your account and request the amount of
ecash you want to withdraw, much like in person. But instead of
putting paper cash in your wallet, your software stores the
digital cash it obtains onto the hard disk of your PC.

     When you are asked to make a payment on the net, you
confirm the amount, purpose and payee and then your ecash
software transfers the correct value in coins from your disk.
Sellers, ranging from casual participants in the global Internet
bazaar to mega-retailers, deposit the digital coins they receive
into their accounts.

     Behind the user interface, your computer actually chooses
the serial numbers of the electronic coins based on a random
seed. Then it hides them in special encryption envelopes,
provides them to the virtual ATM for signing, and removes the
envelopes from what is returned--leaving the bank's validating
digital signature on the serial numbers. This way, when the
bank receives from the shop the coins you spend, it cannot
recognize them as coming from any particular withdrawal,
because they were hidden in envelopes during withdrawal. And
thus the bank cannot know when or where you shop or what you
buy.

     The serial number of each signed coin is unique, allowing
the bank to be sure it never accepts the same coin twice. In
case you wish to identify the recipient of any of your
payments, you can also reveal the serial number and prove that
you formed it. And, in case your computer were ever to break
down, if you had written down the secret random seed number you
chose initially when opening your account, future versions
would let you use it to re-create the coins in envelopes and
thereby obtain a free re-issue of the signed coins that were
lost.

How safe is it
--------------
     Security is fundamental to electronic cash. The
cryptographic coding protecting every 5 cent ecash payment is
the same as that routinely relied upon for authenticating
requests to move huge sums between banks and even for national
security. But in principle ecash goes beyond such
communications security to achieve true multiparty security: no
one (buyer, seller, bank) can cheat anyone else, no matter how
they might modify their own software; even if two parties
collude, they cannot cheat the third.

     Replacing paper and coins with ecash would make life much
harder for criminals. Because the payer's computer chooses the
serial numbers of the coins, he or she can later irrefutably
identify blackmarketeers, extortionists, and acceptors of
bribes--were they to take ecash. Paper notes, briefcases full of
which can be received without leaving any record, allow money
laundering and tax evasion today. With ecash, however, all the
amounts each person receives are known to their bank.
Significant criminal activity could thus be thwarted by
completely replacing paper money; moreover, the privacy of ecash
would be essential to widespread acceptance of any electronic
payment system that in effect becomes mandatory.

Early, competing, and future systems
------------------------------------
     Customers of Mark Twain Bank will have to fill out an
application form that is available over the Internet, mail or
fax it in, and receive a password by mail. The bank's unique
multi-currency facilities will allow use from many countries. In
the future, the ability to withdraw funds from ordinary checking
accounts will be as ubiquitous as making withdrawals at physical
ATMs today. Frequent visits to digital branches will give banks
the opportunity to offer a full range of financial services to
their customers.

     The over 60,000 people who registered for the CyberBucks
experiment--more than all the other cyber-payment schemes
combined--suggests a high level of support and interest in
ecash. DigiCash plans to keep the experiment going for those
who wish to continue using it.

     After CyberBucks went live almost exactly one year ago,
and became the first cryptographically protected Internet
payment scheme, a plethora of "me-too" schemes have been
announced. Most are simply account-based, accepting requests
from users to move money from their account to a specified
other account, thereby revealing to the central system exactly
when, how much, and to whom they pay, and putting users at the
mercy of system errors that may result in loss of money or
unexpected lock out. Only ecash works with digital coins,
empowering people with full control over their side of
financial transactions and full control over when and to whom
identifying information is released.

     Ecash is currently software only: once you've opened an
account you just download the software over the net and you're
ready to run. DigiCash is developing chip cards and simple
readers which will give provide even more security and
portability of ecash between machines.

     DigiCash does not aim to operate ecash systems itself, but
rather to continue developing new versions and licensing to
financial institutions.

                  DigiCash Backgrounder
                  =====================

History and Mission
-------------------
     Since beginning operation in April 1990, DigiCash's mission
and primary activity has been: to develop and license payment
technology products--chip card, software only, and hybrid--that
both show the true capability of technology to protect the
interests of all participants and are competitive in the market.

Founder
-------
     Dr. David Chaum, managing director of DigiCash, received
his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California
at Berkeley, then taught at New York University Graduate School
of Business Administration and at the University of California,
and headed the Cryptography Group at CWI, the Dutch nationally
funded center for research in mathematics and computer science,
before taking his current position. He has published over 45
original technical articles on cryptography and also founded the
International Association for Cryptologic Research.
