&gt; &gt; The cryptographic engine of PrivaSoft
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; PrivaSoft uses a pseudo-random generator that is seeded by a 9 digit number 
&gt; &gt; uniformly normalized from the user's secret key.  The engine is proprietary, 
&gt; &gt; designed according to the rules of modern cryptology to make the best use of 
&gt; &gt; the allowable key length.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems paradoxical. PrivaSoft uses a key approximately 30 bits long. It

&gt; Two possible explanations I can imagine are:
&gt; 
&gt; (0) PrivaSoft actually uses a key longer than 9 digits, and someone just made

Could it be 9 hex digits = 36 bits?

Perhaps there's an even bigger paradox in there:
  "
   The engine is proprietary, designed according to the rules of modern
   cryptology.
  "

Now I'm not familiar with the rules cited, but wouldn't proprietary
tend to go against them?

&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt; The use of default keys

...
&gt; meant to resist attacks based on the cryptanalyst gaining access to many 
&gt; ciphertexts, even if all were encrypted with a single key.

Perhaps theirs isn't? Could be a Freudian slip, you know...

&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt; A simple example:  For a short message, increasing the font 
&gt; &gt; size of the text by a factor of 10 will significantly increase the time 
&gt; &gt; required for breaking the encryption.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know how to get 120 point text in LaTeX ?

Don't worry, the whole thing sounds bogus anyway. I'd say a larger
font would make it *easier* to break (more correlation per pixel).
They probably think it'll be harder because there's more pixels.

In the original message (NOTE CHANGE IN INDENT!):

&gt; Introduction
&gt; 
&gt; PrivaSoft is a communication security product, and the user is entitled to
&gt; know how secure it is.  This document addresses the question of cryptographic 
&gt; strength of PrivaSoft.

No it doesn't.

&gt; Export license regulations
&gt; 
&gt; In some advanced countries, cryptographic products are categorized as 
&gt; "munitions" and their use, sale or exportation is controlled by local 
&gt; licensing regulations.  PrivaSoft has obtained an export license from the 
&gt; governments of Israel and the USA.  Licenses in other countries are obtained 
...

All right, I guess it does. USA approved export, so it must be very weak.

...
&gt; The basic intention of this regulation is to protect the state from abuse of 
&gt; too strong cryptographic products by terrorists and criminals.
...

Is it? I think there are one or two people on this list who think the
intention is otherwise...

...
&gt; The use of default keys
...
&gt; This is done by using the pseudo-
&gt; random "key extension" feature which is described in the PrivaSoft user's 
&gt; guide.

Do they mean "salt"? If so why don't they say it?
If not, what *do* they mean?

&gt; The information contents a clear message

This is a strange title (I suspect "of" dropped out), but it might
well sum it all up :-)

&gt; If a cryptographic product is properly designed, then the almost only way to 

A big "if", if I might say so.

...
&gt; a significant 
&gt; portion of the page must be reconstructed, and a significant amount of 
&gt; mathematical correlation must be calculated between neighboring areas of the 
&gt; image, before the cracking software can tell whether the candidate key is 
...

This can at most buy you a constant factor - useful, but not very.
I doubt the two uses of "significant", too. Anybody remember those
diagrams in Typing textbooks about the layout of a letter?

...
&gt; Customized versions of PrivaSoft
&gt; 
...
&gt; The cryptographic engine can be customer-furnished and customer integrated, 
...

What do they mean by this bit?


Sorry about being so negative, but it is necessary when evaluating security.
