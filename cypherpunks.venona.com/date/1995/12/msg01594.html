P L E A S E  D I S T R I B U T E  W I D E L Y 

             InfoWarCon (Europe) '96
        Defining the European Perspective
               Brussels, Belgium
                 May 23-24 1996 


Sponsored by:

  National Computer Security Association
  Winn Schwartau, President and CEO, Interpact, Inc.
  Robert David Steele, Chairman &amp; CEO, OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS 


Information Warfare represents a global challenge that faces all 
late-industrial and information age nation states.  It also represents 
the easiest and cheapest way for less developed nation-states and 
religious or political movements to anonymously and grieviously attack 
major nations and international corporations.

Not only are the definitions of InfoWar unclear, but they span many 
areas and disciplines. This conference will examine the European 
perspectives on all three classes of Information Warfare while 
contributing some American lessons learned, mistakes made and successes 
enjoyed.

	Class I: Personal Privacy
	Class II: Industrial and Economic Spying and Warfare
	Class III: Global Conflict, Terrorism and the Military

As at all other InfoWarCon, this special European Conference encourages 
active audience participation, contribution and debate.

14:30 - 16:00

Breakout I:	Threats to European Civil Prosperity

		Moderator:
			Admiral Lacoste/General Heinrich, France (Invited)
		Panel:
			Belgium
			Germany 
			United Kingdom 

		Europe is becoming as dependent upon its econo-technical 
		infrastructure more than ever with the design and 
		construction of the European Space Initiative. 
		Communications systems create the basis for global 
		commerce, transportation systems permit the distribution 
		of goods, the financial infrastructure is a requisite 
		component of any information based economy and the power 
		grid glues it all together. But, the threats to their 
		stability and integrity are many and must be dealt with 
		on a continent that has a history of war and more recently 
		terrorism. What are the risks? The rewards? 
		And the solutions?

Breakout II:	Information Warfare: Support for Conventional War Fighting

		Moderator: TBD 
		Panel:
			US - Gen. Jim McCarthy USAF (Ret)
			Russia
			Netherlands

		Conventional Wars and regional conflicts are replacing the 
		fear of East-West conflict. Advanced Industrial and 
		Information Age societies will supplement their armed 
		forces with enhanced information processing capabilities. 
		What are they and will they change the face of war?

16:00-16:30	Sponsored Break							

PLENARY SESSION

16:30 - 18:00	"Hackers: National Resources or Merely Cyber-Criminals?"

		Moderator:
			Mich Kabay, Ph.D.
			Director of Education, NCSA and 
			Robert Steele, President, OSS, Inc.

		Panel:
			Hactic and The Digital City Experiment: 
				Amsterdam, Netherlands (Invited)
			Hacker, United Kingdom 
			CHAOS Computer Club, Germany 

		Are hackers merely criminals operating under the guise of 
		Internet freedom? Or are they national resources to be 
		cultivated and who have served as an early warning system 
		for Cyberspace? One group of American hackers have 
		threatened to "Declare War on France" on behalf of American 
		interests. How do we as nations deal with this?

		Mich Kabay and Robert Steele will debate the issue and then 
		you will meet the hackers in person. The first Information 
		Warriors invite your questions, comments and interaction. 
		Learn first hand who they are, what they believe and how 
		they function. 

18:00 - 21:00	Hosted Reception

May 24, 1996

07:00 - 8:30	Sponsored Continental Breakfast 				

08:30 - 9:00	Keynote Speech							

		"Efforts to Maximize Information As New Age Weapon" (TBD)

PLENARY SESSIONS

9:00 - 10:00	"Creating Smart Nations Through National Information 
		Strategies: Intelligence And Security Issues"	

		Robert David Steele, President, OSS, Inc. US

		Planning for the future requires new thinking and a new 
		"triad" of defense: Open Source Intelligence, Electronic 
		Home Defense and Information Warfare. 21st Century realities 
		invite dozens more players whom must be monitored and 
		controlled. Governments and the military should avail 
		themselves of the publicly available open source 
		information as part of their ongoing intelligence 
		operations. Mr. Steele has suggested that nations should 
		"draft" the civil sector by requiring 'due diligence' and 
		very high standards of private sector communications and 
		computing security.

10:00 - 11:15 	"The Convergence of Military and Commercial Vulnerabilities" 	

		Moderator:
			Winn Schwartau, President and CEO, Interpact, Inc.
		Panel:
			Bob Ayers, DISA, Department of Defense, US
			Holland / Belgium 
			UK
			France 

		Much of military success depends upon the reliable operation 
		of civilian and commercial systems. No longer do the 
		government and military and private sector function in 
		isolation. What levels of cooperation are required to 
		assure proper defense and war fighting capability? How much 
		of the private sector must be viewed as a national security 
		asset - to be protected as much as is a forward deployed 
		military unit?

11:15 - 11:45	Sponsored Break							

11:45 - 13:00	Societal Impact of Information Warfare 				

		Moderator:
			Winn Schwartau, President and CEO, Interpact, Inc.

		Society is absolutely dependent upon technology; without 
		networks and computers and communications, portions of 
		society can collapse within days. If major systems fail, 
		what will the reaction of a techno-reliant society be? 
		And, what are the ethics of a military who instigates the 
		collapse of an adversary's civilian infrastructure rather 
		then resort to bombs and bullets? Is a techno-phobic 
		society psychologically prepared for the consequences?

13:00 - 14:30	Lunch 								

13:30-14:00	Special Luncheon Presentation 

BREAKOUT SESSIONS

14:30 - 16:00

Breakout I:	Legislation &amp; Personal Privacy: 
			A Global Electronic Bill of Rights?

		Moderator:
			General Pickering, Canada (Invited) 
		Panel:
			Electronic Privacy International (Invited)
			Sweden 
			The Vatican 

		This panel will examine the different approaches governments 
		take to protect the personal privacy of their citizens and 
		what steps need to be taken to create a global consensus. 
		How do differing privacy laws affect countries ability to do 
		business? How will authoritarian regimes counter the 
		perceived threat of free and open information flow?

Breakout II:	"Industrial Espionage: An Update"

		Moderator:
			DST, France (Invited)  - (RS)
		Panel:
			Surite tells all 
			Kroll Associates US 
			Germany

		122 Countries are actively engaged in industrial and 
		economic espionage to the benefit of their respective 
		states.  It's a lot easier for a third world or agrarian 
		society to steal intellectual and proprietary property than 
		to invest time and resources develop their own. Who's 
		involved and what are they doing? What steps need to be 
		taken to defend such actions?

PLENARY

16:30 - 18:00	Defining War in the Information Age
			"The New National Security"

		Brief comments by Winn Schwartau and Robert Steele - 
		and then a lively interactive audience debate.

		An enemy bomb landing in any country can be easily 
		construed as an act of war.  However, in Cyberspace, 
		anonymous acts of aggression that lead to war or replace 
		conventional attacks are not so simple to classify.

		This highly charged subject will consider what war is 
		and what it isn't: 

		- Is an attack against a financial institution an act of war?
		- What about the intentional collapse of a communications 
			infrastructure?
		- Is human lethality a necessary pre-requisite for war?
		- Do we need to redefine national security for the post 
			Cold-War world?

18:00 - 18:10 	Closing Comments
