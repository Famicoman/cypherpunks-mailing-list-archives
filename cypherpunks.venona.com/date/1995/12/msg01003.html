&gt; &gt; Regarding Fred Cohen, PhD:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cohen's haughty and bombastic style do nothing good for his reputation.  I
&gt; &gt; assume he advertises his PhD to highlight his early accomplishments; he has
&gt; &gt; done little since.
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently you have a reading disability.  I haven't used Ph.D. next to my
&gt; name on this forum for some time.

	.oO( some time = ~3 weeks )

&gt; &gt; Let's also consider the granting institution, a second-rank school.
&gt; 
&gt; When you insult me, that's one thing, but insulting my school is
&gt; something quite different.  The University of Southern California is one
&gt; of the finest educational institutions in the world, and is widely
&gt; recognized as such.

	.oO( So is Alabama State, even says so in the catalog )

&gt;  The engineering school at USC (from which I earned
&gt; my Ph.D.) is commonly ranked in the top 10 in the US, and in the year
&gt; that I graduated, my department was ranked in the top 5 in the US.
&gt; 
&gt; USC, in addition to having a fine athletic tradition, also has many
&gt; unique benefits that sets it apart from many other excellent schools. 
&gt; But I wouldn't want to advertise in this forum - you'll have to contact
&gt; them directly for more extensive information.

	.oO( I see you still have their catalog )

&gt; &gt; Cohen's thesis broke new ground, but how many people have read it, or any of
&gt; &gt; his writings, or know anything about his ideas beyond a single word?  How far
&gt; &gt; did he carry this work?  Where are the conference and journal papers?  Cohen's
&gt; &gt; reputation faded into obscurity long ago.  Now he is building a new reputation
&gt; &gt; as a pig-headed loudmouth, threatening his "defamers."  Shades of Sternlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Some people are ignorant because they haven't had a chance to learn, but
&gt; other people are ignorant because they choose to be.  In your case, it is

	.oO( Some people just don't have two clues to rub together )

&gt; apparently the latter.  But I will answer your questions nonetheless:
&gt; 
&gt; How many people have read it, or any of his writings, or know anything
&gt; about his ideas beyond a single word?
&gt; 
&gt; 	The thesis has only sold a few hundred copies, however, over
&gt; 	20,000 people have read my books on the subject.  My two
&gt; 	articles in "The Sciences" reached about 25,000 people each.

	   ( I once told an OJ Simpson joke on Usenet )
	   ( that was supposedly seen by 40 million people )
	.OO( including a dozen messaiahs, three space men, )
           ( and a hermathadite. )

&gt; 	But I don't think thatr the value of peoples' work is a
&gt; 	function of how many people know about them.
&gt; 
&gt; How far did he carry this work?
&gt; 
&gt; 	I have published over 30 refereed journal articles on the subject,
&gt; 	about 50 conference papers, about 100 invited talks, and today,
&gt; 	over 1/2 of all computers in the world run virus defense software
&gt; 	using techniques I first published.  That's more refereed papers
&gt; 	than anyone else in the world on that particular subject.

	   ( Also gives Jerry Pournell something to talk about besides )
	.oO( Wing Commander, hope you add that to your resume )


&gt; Where are the conference and journal papers?
&gt; 
&gt; 	They are listed on the Web site listed below.  They include
&gt; 	IEEE, ACM, and IFIP papers, invited papers at IEEE, ACM,
&gt; 	DPMA, IFIP, and NIST conferences (as well as many others).

	   ( What? No WiReD magazine? How did he escape the crackpot )
	.oO( visionary center of the universe? )
	

&gt; So, now that we have a very brief history of my work, let us all know
&gt; where you went to school, how many journal and conference papers you
&gt; have published, how many books you have written.
&gt;
&gt; We already know that you won't tell people your name because you are
&gt; afraid to have it associated with you personally, but maybe you can help

	   ( Dr. Fred hides behind a post office box to people can't )
	.oO( drop by and tell him hes a loon )

&gt; us all understand how expert you are and what you have contributed to
&gt; the world so we can appreciate your point of view.

	.oO( I ain't no Ph.D, but even I can see Fred is a loon )

&gt; -&gt; See: Info-Sec Heaven at URL <A  HREF="http://all.net/">http://all.net/</A>

	   ( Someone told him he was missing the /, was fun while it lasted )
	.oO( Wonder if he will write a paper on URL grammar now )
