	So, I shouldn't take the opportunity to tell those non-technical people 
about the other "hole" they most likely have?  After all this only 
effects Windows users and it is a problem with windows.

	Read what I wrote, I did not say the original post was in error about 
not queuing mail and saw no reason to repeat what appears to be a fact. 
And, if the non technical people don't know about the swap file 
problem, and just assume that if they don't queue mail they are no 
worse off then they have been don a serious disservice.

	BTY, did you check it out?  Or just take what you saw as an 
opportunity to rant?

: 
: &gt; 	Pegasus will indeed save your key with your message in the
: &gt; outgoing queue.  This is a problem with the design of
: &gt; pegasus, not with the design of the add on encryptor.  
: 
: How about saying something USEFUL, like yes or no to the
: question of whether sending WITHOUT queueing will make any
: difference? How about agreeing that if David Harris hopes to
: provide a useful interface to external "encryptors" he will
: have to do something about this?  How about cc'ing David?
: 
: Somebody else could as well point out that we're all full of 
: crap because we don't use Amigas, and while he might have a 
: point, it wouldn't be a very useful one.
: 

	Yes, it would have been a WONDERFUL opportunity to drop a O/S v. O/S 
troll on the list, notice I didn't.

	What I did do, was write up a problem description and mail it to David 
Harris.  This based on the likelyhood that he doesn't read cypherpunks.
