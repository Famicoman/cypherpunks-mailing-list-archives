&gt;&gt;Subject: Political Cleanup program
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Politics is traditionally corrupt, it appears, because donors to politicians
&gt;&gt;and political campaigns expect a quid pro quo for their donations.  Various
&gt;&gt;unsatisfactory solutions include campaign spending limits, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It occurs to me that it would be a major advance if a system could be set up
&gt;&gt;that would "blind" campaign donations as to their source:  The donor could
&gt;&gt;be satisfied that his donation gets to the candidate or cause, but the
&gt;&gt;candidate couldn't know  who actually paid the money (and the donor would be
&gt;&gt;unable to prove that he made a donation, for example).  Admittedly there are
&gt;&gt;a lot of details that need to be worked out, but if this could be
&gt;&gt;accomplished it would change politics as we know it.
&gt;
&gt;If you'll give it some more thought, Jim, you'll see that it has a loophole
&gt;in it you could drive a semi through. There is no way to keep a donor from
&gt;passing the word to the recipient. No matter how you work out the details,
&gt;it's impossible to keep the information from passing. It could never work.

It is absolutely true that you couldn't stop a person from communicating
claims of a donation to a politician.   But what you COULD do is to ensure
that the donor couldn't PROVE that he made such a donation.  In other words,
_I_ could claim that I gave $1K to Senator Sludgepump (a lie) and the good
senator would have no idea that I wasn't telling the truth.  The people who
REALLY made such donations would be helpless.


&gt;Consider a more radical, and possibly workable, solution to the thorny issue
&gt;of campaign finance. If we go back to the root of the problem, it seems
&gt;clear that it is the high cost of a campaign. If a typical campaign were to
&gt;cost a tenth or a twentieth of what it presently costs, we'd have gone a
&gt;long way towards ameliorating the situation. How to do it? Simply ban all
&gt;paid political spot ads - TV, radio, newspaper - all of them. Write it so
&gt;that there's damned little wiggle room - a candidate can use lawn signs, but
&gt;not billboards. They can use personal appearances, but not commercials.
&gt;They can spend all the gas money they want running around their state or
&gt;district, but not a dime for media spots.
&gt;

Well, I have an even better and cheaper solution to the problem of
government and politics.  At an average of $20,000 per Congressman, we could
clean up Washington for $10 million dollars.
