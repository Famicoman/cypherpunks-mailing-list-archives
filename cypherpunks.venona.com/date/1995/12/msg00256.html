&gt; &gt; People employing systems like PGP are already advised to use them
&gt; &gt; on private machines, with only one user, and untampered-with
&gt; &gt; binaries.
&gt; 
&gt; Timings like the ones listed are trivial to take in establishing
&gt; things like SSL sessions, or Photuris sessions. The danger is to
&gt; online protocols, not to PGP.
&gt; Perry

Loathe as I am to disagree with Perry :-), is it really 'trivial' to take these 
timings in an online protocol? Paul writes on the DH example:

-------------------------
A preliminary implementation of the attack using the RSAREF toolkit[8] 
has been written. RSAREF scans across the exponent from MSB to
 LSB and does two exponent bits at a time, so corresponding 
adjustments to the attack were made. Using a 120-MHz PentiumTM 
computer running MSDOSTM, a 512-bit modulus, and a 256-bit secret 
exponent, processing times ranged from 392411 microseconds to 
393612 microseconds and closely approximated a normal distribution
with a mean of 393017 microseconds and a standard deviation of
188 microseconds.
--------------------------

Note that the range is 1201 microseconds

and for RSA:

--------------------------
RSAREF's modular reduction function with a 512-bit modulus on the 
same 120-MHz PentiumTM computer takes an average of 
approximately 17 microseconds less time if c is slightly smaller than 
p, as opposed to slightly larger than p. Timing measurements of 
many ciphertexts can be combined to detect whether the chosen 
ciphertexts are larger or smaller than p.
-------------------------
The range here is 17 microseconds.

Paul notes:
---------------------------
Random delays added to the processing time may increase the 
number of ciphertexts required, but do not completely solve the
problem since attackers can compensate for the delay by collecting 
more measurements. (If enough random noise is added, the attack 
can become infeasible.)
--------------------------

In a 'real' system, there is a lot of unpredictable variation
in the timing of the signal. Sources of such noise include
routers,  and other sessions on the server (any decent server these
days is multi-tasking, and can handle multiple connections 
simultaneously). On top of that, real protocols have a lot of
processing overhead, looking up certificates and keys, generating
MAC hash values, etc, many of which are difficult to predict.

I tried pinging some machines to look at the slop in the roundtrip
times. I have not checked traceroute, but for what it's worth,  I'm in 
central Massachusetts.

elnath (local to my lan)			&lt;10 ms
rtfm.mit.edu (20 miles)			10-21 ms
iii1.iii.net (FreeBSD on a 120MHz P5, 35 miles)	100-200 ms
utopia.hacktic.nl (Netherlands)			190-781 ms

Maybe Paul can give us some figures as to how *much* random
noise is enough to make his (very elegant!) attack unfeasible. Note 
that the range of the random slop I'm getting is hundreds to thousands
of times the range of the signal he needs to detect. Statistical techniques, 
averaging the return times for the same text over many trials may be useful, 
but the number required to detect a less than 1% variation is going to be high.

The attack might be feasible of it can be mounted on a quiet server
from a point 'close' (in network terms) to the timing system, and the 
intervening network segments are also fairly quiet.  I don't think
random users are going to crack the Dilbert Store, however.

Speaking for myself....
