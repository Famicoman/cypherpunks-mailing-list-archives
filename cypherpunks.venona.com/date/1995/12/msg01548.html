&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.  Unless it could be shown there their was an expactation of privacy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the transfer, or that there was an understanding that you intended this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be a confidential matter.  Or in the alternative, that the
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;       I do not understand.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Alice has Alice gives Bob her key.  Cop wants Alice's key.  Cop tells
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob "I want Alice's key, you need to give it to me. I don't have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; warrant."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; How is this different from
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob has key. Cop want's Bob's key. Cop tells Bob "I want your key,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you need to give it to me. I don't have a warrant."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The real concern is this:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bob gives his key to alice.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The cops walk into alice's place and 'convince' alice to turn the key
&gt; &gt; over whithout a warant.  Perhaps alice is more susceptible to
&gt; &gt; persuasion because of some external reasons.  Alice does, Bob has no privacy
&gt; &gt; interest in the key, Bob can no longer argue that it is protected under
&gt; &gt; the 4th amendment.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now let's get more sinister.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The cops mysteriously 'find' the key somewhere without a warrant.
&gt; &gt; Bob cannot argue that the key should be surpressed on the basis of the
&gt; &gt; 4th amendment because he gave it to Alice, and thus clearly it's not
&gt; &gt; information he was interested in protecting.  (This is assuming the cops
&gt; &gt; didn't violate other areas, or break into a house or something, or that
&gt; &gt; if they did, that the court will find out about it).
&gt; 
&gt;   How about if Bob had a contractual agreement with Alice to keep his
&gt; key secret?

Then as a defense attorney, I would argue that Bob had an obvious 
expectation of privacy with Alice, and that the fact that he relayed this 
key to Alice only under those circumstances represents a definite 
expression of his intent to keep the key private, thus triggering 4th 
amendment protections.  My view is that this would be a very strong argument.

Note that this is an academic opinion, not a legal one as I am not being 
paid.
