&gt;
&gt;As Tim May has explained over and over again, "the cypherpunks" do not
&gt;exist.  Cypherpunks is a mailing list, not a society or club.
&gt;"The cypherpunks" as a group can do nothing about what gets posted to
&gt;this list except comment on it.

Precisely.

Some of the many advantages of having no centralized structure/leadership,
and no formal rules/policies, are:

-- less wrangling over leadership and rules (if you think we wrangle and
fight too much, look at organizations that spend *all* of their time
choosing leaders, having boardroom fights, setting policies, fighting,
electioneering, etc...it makes our easily-filtered flame wars pale by
comparison)

-- no leaders means no one in a position of leadership to sue for the many
"infractions" some of our list members commit (violations of export laws,
posting of stolen code, libel, etc., all allegedly, of course)

-- no centralized focus, save for the toad.com machine, which could be
replaced quickly (or cypherpunks could become "alt.cypherpunks" and then
truly have no center, not that I am advocating this, for various reasons).
This lack of a point of pressure, a center, means opponents have nothing to
jab at...they can't write threatening letters to the "Board of Directors"
demanding that certain actions cease, etc.

&gt;Finally, it should be noted that the kind of messages you're posting
&gt;lately are eerily reminiscent of Detweiler's mental deterioration just
&gt;before he went off the deep end.  In fact, the line "How long will the
&gt;cypherpunks put up with this?" may be an exact quote.

Indeed. When I saw this "How long will the Cypherpunks put up with this?" I
initially thought it was tongue in cheek. Apparently not.
