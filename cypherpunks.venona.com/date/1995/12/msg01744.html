YAHOO, ZIFF-DAVIS ANNOUNCE PLAN TO JOIN FORCES

On Tuesday, December 12, Yahoo Corp. and Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. 
announced a strategic relationship that establishes a new, Web-
driven publishing model for delivering content via print, online, 
and CD ROM. The relationship leverages the expertise and brand names 
of Yahoo, operator of the leading directory on the Web, and Ziff-
Davis, the leading publisher of computer magazines and computing 
content online, including ZD Net. 

The new alliance is initially focused on two media products: Yahoo 
Internet Life and ZD/Yahoo Computing. Yahoo Internet Life is an 
interactive magazine based on one of the most popular sites on the 
World Wide Web. ZD/Yahoo Computing seeks to become the ultimate 
value-added, online directory of computing resources on the Web.

Yahoo Internet Life combines a Web site, a print publication, and a 
CD ROM. Each issue of the quarterly magazine will include a CD ROM 
that contains virtually everything in the magazine as well as the 
software that users need to connect to the Web. The print version of 
Yahoo Internet Life will debut on newsstands in February 1996. 

Bill Machrone, Editor-in-Chief of ZD Internet Life and Ziff-Davis's 
Vice President of Technology, was named Editor-in-Chief of Yahoo 
Internet Life.

ZD/Yahoo Computing will be the definitive online guide to finding 
and using computing resources on the Web. It will incorporate an 
enhanced version of The Computing Trailblazer, a popular feature of 
the ZD Net Web site that reviews computing sites on the Internet, as 
well as new features to help people find computing products, 
companies, and services. ZD/Yahoo Computing will be available in 
early 1996.

file and VDOLive video clips, check out the ZD Public Relations site

COMPUTING TRAILBLAZER HELPS YOU "BUY IT ONLINE"

Looking for an easier way to get your hands on the latest hardware 
and software? Why not go online?

Introducing "Buy It Online," the newest category in The Computing 
Trailblazer, Ziff-Davis's guide to computing resources on the Web. 
Each of the nearly two dozen sites that are reviewed in Buy It 
Online offers a strong selection of computer products for sale, and 
many also enable online purchasing (which is likely to become a firm 
requirement for this category in the near future). Some of the sites 
provide links to manufacturers' sites and other Internet resources 
of value to their customers. Others are just plain fun to visit for 
their contests, downloads, and freebies. A few are works in progress 
that show great potential.

What are the common characteristics that mark the better sites? For 
starters, secure credit-card transactions, up-to-date price lists, 
and catalog items that link to product information combining 
overview articles, feature lists, and tech specs. 

If you order computer products on the Web, please click the Feedback 
button tell the Trailblazer editors what your experience was like. 
Good or bad, Trailblazer wants to know about it.

For the latest word on the best computing sites, including more than 
300 (and growing) site-reviews under familiar computer headings, 
check out Trailblazer today at
