I thought people would love to see this.

Note especially "Dr." Fred's threat to have toad.com confiscated as
part of a conspiracy against his reputation.

&gt; &gt; If you mean to imply that I am Alice, that constitutes slander, and I
&gt; &gt; will sue.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd love to see you try. Please, sue me immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; Since you agree in public with Alice practically all the time, the
&gt; damages would be fascinating to assess. "Your honor, my client, who
&gt; has no reputation in the group we are discussing to speak of, feels
&gt; that by being publically conflated with this anonymous personage who's
&gt; opinions he univerasally agrees with that his reputation has been
&gt; damaged, since, well, er, we aren't sure why, but it has. I mean,
&gt; people might ascribe opinions to him that he claims to hold! Obviously
&gt; that must be damaging!"

To the contrary, I have a very good global reputation, and you are
knowingly and maliciously attempting to slander me by claiming that
I use a false identity to support my positions.

&gt; What would the monetary damages be, Fred? I mean, there are some
&gt; people here who would gain a bit of added respect for you since being
&gt; Alice would imply that you knew how to use anonymous remailers, so
&gt; there would be some evidence that you could do *something*, which many
&gt; people here had in doubt up until now. I suspect you actually gain
&gt; reputation that way, so perhaps I should sue you for unjust
&gt; enrichment. (*)

Let's see.  I guess I would start by having the police confiscate the
toad.com computers becfause thay are part of a criminal conspiracy to
daamage my reputation.  Criminal because of the recent changes in the
law that prohibit you from sending me information I don't want to get.

The dollar value would be $1 plus a public apology plus all costs of the
suit plus my time to right the wrong (at my usual fee of course).  Of
course the fact that you have decided to make this posting in public
justifies my extensive efforts to clear my reputation which, unless you
apologize immediately will be surprisingly enjoyable for me.
