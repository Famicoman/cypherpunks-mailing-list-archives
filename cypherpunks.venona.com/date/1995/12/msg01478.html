&gt;jb&gt; 1.  Write a program limited to keysize, carefully constructed to
&gt;jb&gt; isolate those portions of the program which define key size,
&gt;jb&gt; GAKedness, etc.
&gt;
&gt;jb&gt; 2.  Get it export approved.  Export it.
&gt;
&gt;jb&gt; THEN
&gt;
&gt;jb&gt; 3.  Announce that a "US-only" version of the same program is being
&gt;jb&gt; released, and include the minimal component which replaces the
&gt;jb&gt; limited software.  Release it, only in the US of course!
&gt;
&gt;	As has been pointed out, this would prolly doom geting export
&gt;approval for version 2.0.  However, let's keep the developer/publisher
&gt;out of the loop.  How about someone developing a 'binary diff', using
&gt;the functionality of nm to find subroutine entry points, and then doing
&gt;the binary diff from those starting points?  Presumably, for most of the
&gt;program the diff would mostly be changed entry points, with the bulk of
&gt;diff being the crypto module.  Then the bdiff gets exported, and
&gt;bpatch-ed into the export binary.  Of course, this wouldn't work if they
&gt;strip the binary, but who is going to force them to do that?

Okay, that was basically what I was suggesting.  A full binary difference
file wouldn't even need to have any information about the internals of the
program anyway.

Basically, what needs to be achieved is a way to allow the software
manufacturer to sell an approved product outside the country, but allow the
foreign buyer to (easily) convert it into a GOOD encryption product.  Once
that works, laws against the export of encryption are meaningless.  In fact,
the legally-exported program obviously wouldn't even need to HAVE encryption
in it at all, so it won't fall under ITAR classification, and thus won't
need any kind of export license.
