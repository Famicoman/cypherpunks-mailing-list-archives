&gt; He said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widely
&gt; available on the Internet. He said that viewed by crypto experts, not
&gt; much is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where Netscape had
&gt; weak implimentations. He feels that companies will not trust software
&gt; over the 'net. that they "want the US Government to say that 'this is
&gt; good enough'."

  Was he able to name any companies that would not buy products without
the "US Government seal of approval"?  It seems kind of odd that he is
slamming Netscape for having had a weak implementation when he would love
to force everyone to have a "weak implementation".  I'm sure that he will
be happy to know that we have fixed these weaknesses.  :-)

&gt; Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed that
&gt; they were surprized at the industry concern over "one product" for
&gt; worldwide markets. There were lots of questions. He eventually admitted
&gt; that because of the "one product" concern, export regulations will effect
&gt; domestic products. [all the more reason for Netscape to keep building ten
&gt; or whatever it is.]

  Agreed.

&gt; There was a representative from Netscape. He said that they, as a company
&gt; think this is a terrible idea. They oppose it now, and will be issuing
&gt; a company policy soon. I didn't catch his name, and couldn't find him
&gt; to get the obviously carefully prepared text. If someone from Netscape, are
&gt; you listening Jeff W? could get me the text, I'll add it to my writeup.

  I assume you are talking about the exact text of the statement that
our representative made at the meeting.  I will try to get it, but it
may take a day or two since they will be in DC until at least tomorrow.
