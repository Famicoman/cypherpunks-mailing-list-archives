COMPUTER LIFE ONLINE PRESENTS THE HOT SITE OF THE DAY

The editors at Computer Life Online surf the Net like a bad habit. When
they find sites that are hot, fresh, interesting--or just relevant to a
healthy computer life--they share the news with everyone here on the Web.
Then, before the Site of the Day gets warm, they put it on the "Previously
Featured Hot Sites" page and serve up another one. Check these out, and you
may be on your way to developing a few bad Net habits of your own:

INTRODUCING Q&amp;A WITH PC MAGAZINE'S MICHAEL MILLER

PC Magazine Online (<A  HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/~pcmag/">http://www.zdnet.com/~pcmag/</A>) is now giving their readers
the opportunity to ask PC Magazine's editor-in-chief, Michael Miller, frank
questions regarding the ever-changing state of the computer industry. Every
week, this new column will feature questions from readers about a given topic.
You can send questions as well as suggestions for topics you'd like to see
Miller address in future columns.

As Miller puts it: "My print column is really an essay on a particular topic.
I try to focus on a broad variety of things, although most my print columns
have been Internet-related lately. That's not too much of a surprise, as I've
been spending a lot of time working with new tools and content for the
Internet. This column will be more conversational. It will give me an
opportunity to answer reader questions and address their concerns. In
addition, this Q&amp;A will be more timely than my magazine column because it
doesn't have to be printed, bound, and mailed."

Among Miller's first topics: PC Magazine's 1995 Technical Excellence Awards
and reflections on the recent Comdex show.
