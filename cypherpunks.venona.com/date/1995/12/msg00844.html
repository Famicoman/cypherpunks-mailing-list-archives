COMPUSERVE(R) SUSPENDS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC INTERNET NEWSGROUPS

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 28, 1995 -- During the past week, CompuServe Incorporated
temporarily suspended access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups in response to
a direct mandate from the prosecutor s office in Germany.  Each of the
newsgroups that was suspended was specifically identified to CompuServe by the
German authorities as illegal under German criminal law.  CompuServe did not
select any groups or determine the nature of the newsgroups that have been
impacted by this action.  
        German government officials, as part of an investigation of illegal
material on the Internet, ordered CompuServe to do what was necessary with
respect to specified newsgroups in order to comply with German law.  German
authorities are investigating newsgroups and other Internet content that may
contain child pornography, other pornographic material illegal for adults, as
well as content that although not illegal for adults is of such an explicit
nature that it is illegal for minors.  
        While access has been suspended, CompuServe continues to work with
German authorities to resolve this matter.  CompuServe cannot alter the content
on the Internet in any way and has only suspended access to the disputed
newsgroups through CIS.  The issues being investigated in Germany, like those
being addressed across the industry, need to remain focused on the individuals
and groups placing content on the Internet.  CompuServe, as an access provider,
is not responsible for the origination or nature of content on the Internet over
which it has no creative or editorial control.

        The global market is vital to CompuServe.  We currently have 500,000
members in Western Europe and anticipate doubling that number in the next year.
As the leading global service, CompuServe must comply with the laws of the many
countries in which we operate.  
However, laws in different countries are often in conflict, and this creates new
challenges unique to the emerging online industry.  CompuServe is investigating
ways in which we can restrict user access to selected newsgroups by geographical
location.
