Yes it's full of headers, but it's the complete, unexpurgated version.
If this theory is correct, this IS FAR WORSE THAN A 40 bit key.

I saw the livescript on the source code.
I use 1.22 for image stability right now, though.

Yes it's a came from, a came from, a came from kinda deal,
but in the interest of security brevity it "seems real enough" to me.

Love Always,

Carol Anne

&gt;&gt;Subject: Netscape 2.0b2 allows for invasion of privacy
&gt;&gt;Newsgroups: aus.net.announce,comp.privacy
&gt;&gt;Date: Fri, 01 Dec 1995 11:09:06 +1100
&gt;
&gt;Hi 'Net Dwellers,
&gt;
&gt;First off - I've posted this before (however not to this group) and only
&gt;got a response from the Netscape Corp.  They were glad I found the
&gt;problem and said that they would fix it, however I feel that people
&gt;should know about it.  Also I would like people to help me spread this
&gt;document around, i.e. if you know of a newsgroup (or people) that would
&gt;find this interesting then please re-postit.
&gt;
&gt;On with the problem...
&gt;
&gt;I've recently got hold of the latest netscape, and was (at first) very
&gt;excited about the new "LiveScripts" that it supports.  If people don't
&gt;yet know - these "LiveScripts" allow you to put small programs into your
&gt;web page that is then executed by the Netscape client.  There is no
&gt;DIRECT way for these programs to send information back to the owner of
&gt;the web page, however I was able to do it in a not-so-direct way.
&gt;
&gt;The "LiveScript" that I wrote extracts ALL the history of the current
&gt;netscape window.  By history I mean ALL the pages that you have visited
&gt;to get to my page, it then generates a string of these and forces the
&gt;Netscape client to load a URL that is a CGI script with the QUERY_STRING
&gt;set to the users History.  The CGI script then adds this information
&gt;to a log file.  Now if this hasn't quite CLICKED yet lets do a little
&gt;example.
&gt;
&gt;Johnny Mnemonic starts up his newly acquired version of Netscape2.0b2
&gt;to start his daily "surf" session.  First he decides to check his CD-NOW
&gt;purchase and uses the handy Auto-Login URL.  Then he decides to go to
&gt;Lycos and do a search.  In his search he find my page, which he decides
&gt;to visit.  Suddenly he is transported, not to my main page but to one
&gt;of my CGI scripts, which in turn happens to have ALL the URL's he just
&gt;been to in it.  This means that in my log will be:
&gt;
&gt;  - the URL to use to get into CD-NOW as Johnny Mnemonic, including
&gt;    username and password.
&gt;  - The exact search params he used on Lycos (i.e. exactly what he
&gt;    searched for)
&gt;  - plus any other places he happened to visit.
&gt;
&gt;I do this in a way that the user will KNOW that it has happened and
&gt;will _hopefully_ email Netscape and tell them they are NOT impressed.
&gt;But it would be EASY for me to change the CGI script so that the user
&gt;is unaware that it has actually happened, unless they closely examine
&gt;their URL history (in fact they'll probably just think its a netscape
&gt;bug).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If you're skeptical about this then do the test yourself.  Get netscape
&gt;2.0b2 and do some normal surfing, and then go to Lycos.  Do a search for:
&gt;
&gt;  scotts car boot sale
&gt;
&gt;which should return the URL - <A  HREF="http://www.tripleg.com.au/staff/scott">http://www.tripleg.com.au/staff/scott</A>
&gt;
&gt;Click on the URL and sit back an watch.  First my main page will show up
&gt;but a little while later you should be transported to a CGI bin script
&gt;that will show you your URL history.
&gt;
&gt;I have tested this with both the Linux 2.0b2, and Solaris 2.0b2 versions
&gt;and both have done the same thing.  I would be interested in knowing if
&gt;it happens for ALL versions of Netscape2.0b2.  The log file does log
&gt;the User Agent (i.e. the name of the platform you are using) so by simply
&gt;going to the page I will know that your version of Netscape is also
&gt;open to this form of attack.
&gt;
&gt;Currently I can find no way to configure Netscape2.0b2 to NOT run
&gt;LiveScripts - and at the very least this option should be quickly
&gt;added to the next version of netscape to be released.  But a far
&gt;better solution (IMHO) would be for netscape to pop up a window before
&gt;running the LiveScript and let you know what the LiveScript wants access
&gt;to, e.g. if it only wants to print out the current time then that's
&gt;OK, but if it wants to read my history list and then transport me to
&gt;a CGI script and add me to a logfile then maybe I would say NO.
&gt;
&gt;I think I've said enough....
&gt;
&gt;If you've got any further questions, or want some more information just
&gt;email me : scott@tripleg.com.au
