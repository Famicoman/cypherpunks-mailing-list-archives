This turned up on alt.anonymous.  One would need a technical specification
or a working model to be sure, but it sounds like home-grown snake oil
to me.  My guess is that a nineteenth-century cryptanalyst could crack
this, and that the TLAs would have a field day.

What do other people think?

&gt; 
&gt;                 Complete Fax Privacy Draws Closer
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      Individuals receiving faxes, be they of a business or
&gt; personal nature, will soon be able to encrypt the contents and
&gt; make them unreadable to people for whom the messages are not
&gt; intended.
&gt;      The new fax encryption technology has been developed by the
&gt; University of Rochester in New York.  The encryption program
&gt; would make all faxes unreadable to the naked eye.  Only by
&gt; placing a customized transparent plastic sheet over the message
&gt; could it be made readable.  Each individual, employee or manager
&gt; would be issued with his own plastic sheet and encryption key
&gt; ensuring messages are only read by those specified in the message
&gt; itself.  The encryption software would not slow the transmission
&gt; and reception of fax messages and the cost of installing the
&gt; system on to existing machines would be minimal.
&gt;      Such software would be indispensable to those whose
&gt; activities require the utmost confidentiality or privacy.  Nosy
&gt; employees, rivals, those providing faxing services and anybody
&gt; else who has, until now, had a birds eye view of your fax
&gt; communications could be successfully abolished from the security
&gt; equation.
&gt;      Though the software has yet to be refined into a marketable
&gt; commodity, it is set to be introduced for public consumption in
&gt; the very near future.
