I was one of the "naked hippies in the hot tub," for a couple of hours or so.


&gt;This chair now had another guy sitting in it, and, as I had been doing

Yes, I was surprised it was Bob, as I hadn't heard he was there. But, then,
I had been in the hot tub and was in a state of torpor even afterwards.
Also, I tend to sit and not partake of the frenzied shmoozing which so
often occurs at these parties.

I probably would've encountered Bob earlier if people were doing what I
urge them to do at my parties: wear name tags. (I have a pile of name tags
and suggest to people that wearing them is completely "voluntary" in the
true sense--not the Newspeak GAK sense--and that they can of course choose
to remain unknown to others. This helps greatly in recognizing and
remembering names, and it's too bad name tags have been tagged as "uncool"
by so many.)

I guess to an outsider this party at the geodesic dome in the Santa Cruz
mountains must've seemed like the canonical California experience, complete
with hot tubs, redwoods, programmers, writers, etc. To us, it's just
normal.

By the way, in honor of the "geodesic network" and "geodesic payment
systems," and the geodesic dome the party was in, I propose we rename "e$"
with a more fitting name: "buckybucks." Or just "buckys" for short. ("Did
you remember to replenish the buckybits?")
