	Mr. Zimmerman has a fine book on PGP from MIT press (well,
it's the online docs in bound form, but it's still good) that explains
his program very well.  Or get one of the front ends: exmh or mailcrypt
for *nix platforms, Eudora hacks for Mac (and Winblowz?),  any one of
numerous Winblowz front ends.  Privacy is worth a little effort :).

	A lot of the problem is that the AOL-ies and M$N people 
actually belive the marketing hype that they're on the net.

	Why not, in the words of Deion Sanders, "Both"?  A new treehouse
might just hammer home to the clueless politicos that they can't regulate
technology like in the past.

	Maybe I'll get bored and actually play with a UDP Dining
Cryptographer's network.  Just to ship random numbers around, of course.
