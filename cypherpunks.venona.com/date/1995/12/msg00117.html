&gt; John Gave gave an interesting pitch for Java at the CSSI Computer

No comment.

&gt; 	He (John Gage) regularly downloads binary executables from the

He downloads executables and runs them while connected to ...

Oops, ... no comment.

&gt; 	Sun has terrible physical security - unknown people roam the halls

How do they get in the building in the first place??  Someone should 
think about a MEMBERS ONLY sign or something ...

Oops, ... no comment.

&gt; 	In 2 years, you will be able to buy a computer that does more than

&gt; 	bandwidth direct to the Internet, for less than $30.

Now this last one could not pass without a deserved comment.

How will John have my fingers connect with the cell-phone sized keyboard?? 
I guess for LESS than $30, I probably shouldn't be moaning and
complaining, though ... especially if its energy-star compliant.

Dr. Fred, as usual ... you're a hoot.  

Your timing is great.  And as luck would have it, I've got a Sun open
house to go to this Monday for their pre-Christmas shin-dig.  The
President of Sun Canada, (I think) is supposed to be in attendance. 

You just gave me some great material to goad him with.  Thanks.

Even though these social things aren't usually for shop-talk, I think I
might just save some of this stuff for use at the punch bowl. 

(Naah, I wouldn't do that.)-;  

But it is great material ... and perfect timing ... 



Alice de 'nonymous ...

                                  ...just another one of those...
