&gt;&gt;It is not simply an issue of money, it is an issue of national security. If a

&gt;&gt;the comming to power of Rupert Murdoch. Fortunately his influence on the US 
&gt;&gt;political scene has thus far been minor. In his own country he has brought
down 
&gt;&gt;the government more than once.

&gt;[IMO] Rupert has done more for humor than any humor-impaired liberal

Murdoch is bitterly hated by our elites, because things are speakable on
his networks that are unspeakable on other networks.

Hence their perfectly true claim that he has overthrown several 
governments.

I hope he overthrows some more.

I especially love the political humor on "married with children"

Cypherpunk relevance:  Murdoch got in deep shit because of his famous
speech that the communication revolution would profoundly undermine
the power of oppressive governments.

Murdoch sometimes calls himself a libertarian, but he is more a conservative
with bombs.  Still, I am strongly in favor of bombs.   It seems clear to
me that Murdoch, whatever his political beliefs may be, has done much
for liberty.  He has been a powerful disruptive influence.
