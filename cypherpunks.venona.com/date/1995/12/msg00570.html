&gt;&gt; It occurs to me that it would be a major advance if a system could be set up
&gt;&gt; that would "blind" campaign donations as to their source:  The donor could
&gt;&gt; be satisfied that his donation gets to the candidate or cause, but the
&gt;&gt; candidate couldn't know  who actually paid the money (and the donor would be
&gt;&gt; unable to prove that he made a donation, for example).  Admittedly there are
&gt;&gt; a lot of details that need to be worked out, but if this could be
&gt;&gt; accomplished it would change politics as we know it.
&gt;
&gt;Just a straight Chaumian style blinding won't work, as there are too many 
&gt;covert channels available via both timing and amounts; For example, Joe 
&gt;Random Capitalist-Oppressor could arrange to pay a series of relatively 
&gt;small amounts wth different values in the cents field which could be used 
&gt;to confirm their payment (e.g. they could be composed to form a digitally 
&gt;signed value of some kind ("pollution rools" or "lung cancer is kool") :)

Yes, as I suggested a number of details would be necessary to avoid this.
Reporting only cumulative donations, occasionally over a long period of time
(once every three months, for instance), and even then only approximating
the total number would make  doing such a correlation extremely difficult.


&gt;Sen. Dianne Running-Dog could then look for a matching set of donations 
&gt;and confirm that the bribe had in fact been paid. 
&gt;
&gt;There are much better ways of reforming the political system -the 
&gt;formation of proper political parties with real programmes (the one good 
&gt;thing about the newtoid surge); changing the rules for TV advertising, 
&gt;etc. Blinding just makes things worse.

The blinding needs only be temporary; long enough so the politician can't
act improperly on the donation, but  eventually revealed in enough time to
expose political influence before  the next election.


Besides, I have already proposed what I consider to be a _better_ method of
reforming government.  It's called "Assassination Politics."  Perhaps you've
heard of it.
