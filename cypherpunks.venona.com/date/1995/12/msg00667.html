&gt;         This might be relevant. This is a page from the NCCOSC web site

Thanks for posting this.  It was very helpful.  

&gt;         The Naval Command, Control  &amp; Ocean Surveillance Center (NCCOSC)
&gt; is the U.S. Navy's warfare center for command, control and communication
&gt; systems and ocean surveillance and the integration of those systems which
&gt; overarch multiplatforms. NCCOSC is based in San Diego, CA.
&gt; 
&gt;         Note that NCCOSC recently decided to beef up NCI's user
&gt; authentication.  See "Current Initiatives."

Duly noted ... (as long as it don't lead to a false sense of security)

&gt; [* ] NCI net - What it is
&gt; 
&gt;    * An enterprise network serving NCCOSC and other communities of interest
&gt;    * Modelled after the global Internet, logically part of the Internet
         ...
&gt;    * Provides ubiquitous high-speed low-delay TCP/IP connectivity throughout
&gt;      the organization and to the Internet
&gt;    * Provides dialup access from home or TDY via 1-800 number, including
&gt;      SLIP and PPP support

Betchya that WATS line gets a whole lotta billings to it. &lt;p&gt;

&gt;    * MIME adopted as corporate email standard, email systems upgraded
&gt;         o Many user agents upgraded to MIME compliance
&gt;         o Testing gateways for interoperability with non-compliant systems
&gt;         o Performing extensive interoperability tests

MIME??!!??  They adopted MIME??!!?? 

Good grief.  This is not good ... not good at all.  

&gt;    * New sites connected
&gt;         o CINCLANTFLT, Norfolk, VA
&gt;         o The Pentagon
&gt;              + BRAC Office
&gt;              + OSS LAN
&gt;              + DASN/C3I

Oh no ... it's worse ... *sigh* ... 

no wonder that Newt and Dole had such a grim look on their faces when they
emerged from their scheduled one-hour, (went for two) meeting with the US
President -- the one that was the day before the freshman congress persons
did their incredible end-run on their own leadership. 

Impressive.  Truly.

What would have caused both Newt and Dole to flush like they did?  Did
they demo a hack into the personal e-mail of the Vice-Chairman of the JCS? 

&gt;    * New Web server installed
&gt;         o "neelix", a Sun SparcServer 1000, installed outside firewall
&gt;         o "www.nosc.mil" now points at neelix

Pretty firewall ... nice firewall ... &lt;p&gt;

&gt;    * Enhancing Infrastructure to provide ISDN dialup service

Good idea.  ISDN dialup provides significant bandwidth.  Very significant
bandwidth. Almost enought to control a battleship.  (If there were any
battleships, I mean). 

&gt;    * Upgrading D.C. area connectivity to Metropolitan Fiber service at 10
&gt;      Mbps
&gt;    * Getting sites 100% connected (TCP/IP to every desktop)
&gt;    * Developing MIME to X.400 gateway for connectivity to DMS world

Yep.  Perfect.  Just what the doctor ordered.  TCP/IP to every desktop.
And MIME for all.  Oh, and to ice the cake, toll-free ISDN dial-ins.

Hmm, let's see ... for Christmas Santa ... I'd like a packet-switched 
network with a public outdial to a toll-free ISDN dial-in ... oh, that 
and a Gulfstream V under the Christmas tree.

What are they going to do next, give everyone some Czechoslovakian C-4?

Stick a bit of civilian software into all of this, and let's all have a
good look at whether someone can take over something a little more
interesting than a battle ship. 

Like maybe an aircraft carrier?? 

Gee, that oughta harden their drawers ...
