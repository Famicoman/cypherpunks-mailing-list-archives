&gt;It is very strange the way that "Libertarians" are so able to turn all
&gt;rights into property rights. Thus freedom of speech become freedom to have
&gt;influence on the politicial process in direct proportion to wealth.

And what do you propose? Speech in proportion to ability to bitch???

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;When the Web becomes as ubiquitous as the telephone we 
&gt;will still see inequalities of power, the homeless and the poor will still &gt;be underrepresented.

Let me guess, somehow the government can cure this?

&gt;But that situation must be judged against our own where the 
&gt;political process can be bought and traded as if it were any other form of 
&gt;comodity.
&gt;
&gt;It is not simply an issue of money, it is an issue of national security. If a 
&gt;foreigner were to control the majority of the media there would be a significant 
&gt;threat to the national interest. This threat has been realised in the UK with 
&gt;the comming to power of Rupert Murdoch. Fortunately his influence on the US 
&gt;political scene has thus far been minor. In his own country he has brought down 
&gt;the government more than once.

So what??? He gives us "The Simpsons" and "Married, With Children!"
[IMO] Rupert has done more for humor than any humor-impaired liberal
has ever done!

&gt;&gt;And as far as "prevent the political process from being owned by the rich" 
&gt;&gt;goes, there have been brief exceptions over the last 5000 years in which
&gt;&gt;the less-rich have overthrown the rich, but campaign finance laws have &gt;&gt;almost never kept the rich or the politicians from helping each other out.

So??? I'm fighting them, are you???

&gt;In UK politicis the influence of an individual's money is limited to influencing 
&gt;one party. Even that is done behind closed doors. The other major parties both 
&gt;limit the size of individual contributions to a constituency party to a 
&gt;relatively nominal sum. $5000 is a huge sum in UK politics.

They probably bribe in accordance with the marketplace. Big deal.

&gt;&gt;I also don't believe freedom of speech should be limited by national 
&gt;&gt;boundaries.
&gt;
&gt;Nor do I. But I only vote in one country. If we take the question outside &gt;the US 
&gt;it would not on the whole be a good thing if the Prime Minister of Tobago (say) 
&gt;were provided with a campaign contribution of $1M by a foreign company with &gt;an 
&gt;interest in strip mining the entire island. similarly it would be a bad &gt;thing if 
&gt;Columbian drug lords were to make massive contributions to politicians &gt;committed 
&gt;to continuing the prohibition on drugs.

They do, right now. Do you think the Libertarians have gotten any
contributions from the drug-smugglers??? If so, please tell me what you
are on and where I can get some. Otherwise, kwitcherbitchin.
