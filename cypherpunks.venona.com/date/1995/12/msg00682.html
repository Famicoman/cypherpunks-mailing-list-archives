Look, Ma!  Java code!

Real cyph3rpunks, of course, flame each other anonymously.

(Incidentally, I got tired of Alice making it to my noise box, and the
following seems to work well.  Deleting the leading ^ characters would
cause all responses to go into the junk box; perhaps a good idea.
This is, for those of you who don't recognize it, procmail code.  My
mail filter of choice for hacking in.)

&gt; Subject: Java implementation of secure login protocol
&gt; Date: 19 Dec 1995 23:12:52 -0800
&gt; Organization: QUALCOMM, Incorporated; San Diego, CA, USA
&gt; Lines: 64

&gt; 
&gt; Please note that this article is cross-posted both to comp.lang.java and
&gt; sci.crypt.  If you follow up, please trim the newsgroups appropriately.
&gt; 
&gt; Since a number of people expressed interest, I'm releasing an initial
&gt; implementation of a secure login protocol in Java.  This is still very
&gt; much a work in progress (it's not really even of alpha quality), but
&gt; the protocol itself is functional.
&gt; 
&gt; It's intended that the classes in crypto.* and qualcomm.qbs.login.*
&gt; live on the client; any other classes needed would be downloaded over
&gt; the encrypted link.  Hopefully, the client-resident classes will be
&gt; few in number and change rarely; they are just intended to bootstrap
&gt; up the connection.  In the long run, the classes in crypto.* could be
&gt; provided by the vendor of the Java VM.
&gt; 
&gt; The distribution consists of two files:
&gt; 	<A  HREF="ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/pub/gnoel/java.login.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/pub/gnoel/java.login.tar.gz</A>
&gt; 	<A  HREF="ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/pub/gnoel/java.no-export.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/pub/gnoel/java.no-export.tar.gz</A>
&gt; The first file contains the logic to execute the protocol and launch
&gt; the splash screen (see below); it also contains the base classes from
&gt; crypto.* but no cryptographic functions.  The second file contains the
&gt; base classes and the actual implementations of a few cryptographic
&gt; functions to demonstrate how the base classes can be used.
&gt; 
&gt; For sci.crypt, I've tried to capture the essence of what cryptographic
&gt; functions can do in the base classes, without being specific to any
&gt; particular protocol.  I'm not completely happy with it, and would welcome
&gt; any comments people might have on what might be missing.  It's as minimal
&gt; as I could make it and still provide a basis for whatever protocols need
&gt; to be implemented.
&gt; 
&gt; My motivation here is that Sun and Netscape are talking about defining
&gt; a standard way of incorporating cryptographic functions in Java; it would
&gt; be nice if the specification were usable for a lot more than the security
&gt; protocols that come with Netscape.  (I wouldn't object to having access
&gt; to SSL from Java---in fact, I'd really like it---but I'd also like access
&gt; to MD5 and the like.)
&gt; 
&gt; This implementation of the secure login protocol uses short text strings
&gt; to identify the packets being exchanged; that's for convenience while
&gt; debugging---in a production implementation, it would be done differently.
&gt; Other than that, I'd appreciate any suggestions as to how to improve the
&gt; implementation.  (A MAC digest prefixed to the packets is something I'm
&gt; considering, for example.)
&gt; 
&gt; For comp.lang.java, the splash screen is loaded over the secure connection
&gt; but attempts to instantiate a member of the class cause a NoSuchMethodError
&gt; to be thrown.  The class itself seems to be defined correctly, and it should
&gt; be no different from how an applet would be loaded and instantiated, but it
&gt; still fails.  If anyone can tell me what is going wrong and what I can to
&gt; to fix it, the pizza and beer will be on me.  (This has been a showstopper
&gt; for four days now and I'm getting very frustrated by it.)
&gt; 
&gt; The class design tries to minimize the number of classes that must be
&gt; present in the bootstrap set; this led to a somewhat, ah, baroque set of
&gt; functionality.  If anyone has suggestions on how this could be done better,
&gt; I'd be pleased to hear about it.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any questions about this, don't hesitate to drop me a line
&gt; or post something in one of the newsgroups.  I'm going home for some sleep
&gt; now, but I'll be banging my head against it again in the morning.
