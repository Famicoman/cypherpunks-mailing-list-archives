&gt;&gt;There are (basically) no restrictions on the use or distribution
&gt;&gt;of the (very simple) code.
&gt;
&gt;This is simply untrue. Read the fine print in the file. Use this code
&gt;and you owe them big. They'll "reach out and touch" you big time.

You're wrong.

Direct from the shar file:

Nothing, but nothing in there restricts you from doing anything you like
with the software, as long as you provide attributation.

&gt;If they were serious, they'd gpl it.

Maybe they don't like the terms of the gpl?  Maybe they don't want
to restrict *you* to having to give it away?  (And before you jump
my ass for being anti-gnu, go check the various GNU sources for work
I've submitted in the past.)

&gt;I don't understand why this group continues to tolerate these blatently
&gt;commercial messages from att (and netscape.) (The message is
&gt;really just an ad for the cryptolib product, as it says). I've also said
&gt;this b4 but I'll say it again: why would anyone in their right mind trust
&gt;binary code from att after the clipper fiasco.

Is this where we point out that it was Young Master Blaze who pointed out the
technical failure in Clipper?

&gt;And why do we tolerate Jeff Weinstein and Mat Blaze calling themselves
&gt;cypherpunks, when they are so clearly just working us for their
&gt;corporate interests? I wonder how much they get paid to monitor this
&gt;list?

"Cypherpunks write code."  (Where is yours?)
