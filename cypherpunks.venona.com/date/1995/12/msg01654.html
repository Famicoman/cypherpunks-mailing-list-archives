&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   How about if Bob had a contractual agreement with Alice to keep his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key secret?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then as a defense attorney, I would argue that Bob had an obvious 
&gt; &gt; &gt; expectation of privacy with Alice, and that the fact that he relayed this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; key to Alice only under those circumstances represents a definite 
&gt; &gt; &gt; expression of his intent to keep the key private, thus triggering 4th 
&gt; &gt; &gt; amendment protections.  My view is that this would be a very strong
&gt; &gt; &gt; argument.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bob's Fourth Amendment rights are not triggered by his contract with 
&gt; &gt; Alice.  Alice can be compelled to give up the key (by testimony or 
&gt; &gt; production) and giving up that key does not tend to incriminate *Alice* 
&gt; &gt; in a violation of law.  Alice can't invoke Bob's rights against 
&gt; &gt; self-incrimination for obvious reasons:  Alice isn't Bob.
&gt; &gt; ^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; You've taken the narrow answer I was trying to give out of context.
&gt; As for fifth amendment questions, That's another discussion entirely.  If 
&gt; this was not an error, then you have still taken the question way beyond the
&gt; narrow scope I was addressing.

You are correct:  I didn't realize/remember/whatever that you were 
limiting the remarks to the narrow scope you set forth below.
And on the point you were addressing, I agree with you.

Sorry to have added the fog ...

&gt; I was answering only as to how the manifestation of Bob's privacy
&gt; interest might impact the argument that the key was no longer a protected 
&gt; interest acording to the Smith v. Maryland ruling, and thus unprotected 
&gt; by the fourth amendment on those grounds.  (Assuming it would even be
&gt; applied to the Bob - Alice relationship in terms of crypto keys).
&gt; 
&gt; Your statement "Bob's Fourth Amendment rights are not triggered by his 
&gt; contract with Alice."  Is probably correct in the event the key is 
&gt; obtained from Alice.  It may not be if the key is obtained by electronic 
&gt; measures or otherwise without a warrant and then the argument is made 
&gt; after the fact that Bob has exerted no expectation of privacy over the 
&gt; key.  This is the key question which bears on the key escrow's 
&gt; effect on Bob's protection (Alice in that example being the escrow 
&gt; agent).  Clearly Alice in that circumstance is unlikely to give up the 
&gt; key without a warrant.  The real worry is that the authorities are given 
&gt; free reign to obtain the key by other methods from Bob, or Bob's 
&gt; communications without a warrant by the mere fact that Bob has "tendered" 
&gt; the information to Alice (the escrow agent).
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I'm addressing the narrow issue of voluntary surrendering of key 
&gt; information to an escrow agent and it's effect on the 'third party' 
&gt; rule in Smith v. Maryland, not the eventual outcome of an exclusionary 
&gt; hearing.
