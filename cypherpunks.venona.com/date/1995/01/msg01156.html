&gt;Subject: Re: Why emoney? Why not a web of debt?

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Many companies are already founded on "a web of debt".
&gt;&gt;"Sallie Mae (Student Loans), Ginnie Mae (General Loans), and Freddie Mac
&gt;&gt;(Real Estate Loans)," all come to mind at the moment. They're nicely
&gt;&gt;formatted, processed and make even more money for investors as the
&gt;&gt;interest rates change.
&gt;
&gt;Of course the ultimate IOUs these webs of debt are (implicitly, if not
&gt;explicitly) based on are those of the American taxpayer -- which means
&gt;Uncle Sam is playing collection agency, which the usual supporting cast
&gt;of guns and goons.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So maybe the remailer IOU's, could be traded for the data haven IOU's,
&gt;&gt;and so forth. I think someone does have a credit card IOU situation.
&gt;&gt;The systems, and precedence for debt trading are there (and interest
&gt;&gt;rates are going up again soon, indicated the Fed last week!).
&gt;
&gt;Of course, someone's going to have to package up those IOUs (and make
&gt;people pay interest if anyone is going to make money out of it... (Even
&gt;students pay interest.) Which is why I'm pushing (endlessly, tediously)
&gt;the idea of a special purpose corporation whose job it is to issue IOUs
&gt;(in return for an equivalent amount of cash). The people who buy the IOUs
&gt;get anonymous ecash that anyone (remailers, data vaults, data havens) will
&gt;accept (because it is credible that it will be repaid), and the corporation
&gt;that issues the IOUs gets to use the money it got paid to earn interest
&gt;until the IOUs are cashed in.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I just wonder who wants to play "collection agency"?
&gt;
&gt;Which is the big problem for community action generally -- as the community
&gt;gets bigger (and more anonymous?) the effectiveness of communal
&gt;disapprobation diminishes (:-)). A special purpose corporation, on the other
&gt;hand, not only has a reputation to protect, and can be sued, but has an
&gt;interest in making its financial/credit rating details as public as possible
&gt;(reassure the customers, and make more intersest income -- although the real
&gt;income is likely to come from fees...)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;D.
