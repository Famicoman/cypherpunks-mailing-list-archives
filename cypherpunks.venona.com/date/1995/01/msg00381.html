No, sometimes you don't learn till you've made a mistake.
As you could see I hurt really badly yesterday.

And now, so I can occupy myself quietly for a few days, are there
some good files to read so I can understand, and become a good remailer?

&gt; The value of anonymity, both on the nets and off, seems to be poorly
&gt; understood, even among its strongest defenders.  The positive value of
&gt; anonymity is not merely about protecting a few special groups such as
&gt; sexual-abuse victims and whistleblowers.  While these are certainly
&gt; valuable uses, if I believed that anonymity's positive impact were
&gt; limited to these outside-the-mainstream groups, then I probably
&gt; wouldn't accept the benefits of anonymity as outweighing its costs.
&gt; 
&gt; But in fact, I believe that anonymity has crucially important benefits
&gt; for nearly everyone.  There are several good arguments to be made, but
&gt; in the interest of brevity I'll focus on only one:
&gt; 
&gt; The explosive development of such personal data industries as targeted
&gt; marketing and consumer and demographic profiling, have demonstrated
&gt; that the business community considers personal data to be of great
&gt; economic value.  (There's a parallel observation to be made here about
&gt; governments, but I won't go into that now.)  There are also myriad
&gt; uses being made of personal data throughout the professions, from
&gt; labor negotiators to house burglars.  It is something of a truism that
&gt; anyone who knows enough about you can probably find a way to beat you,
&gt; either legally or illegally, often at great profit to themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; In an information-age society without extremely strong privacy
&gt; protections, the chief factor which makes the difference between
&gt; winners and losers may be how much information each of us has on
&gt; others, and how much they have on us.  Given this degree of economic
&gt; and social motivation, it is easy to imagine the sort of panopticon
&gt; which will soon arise on the Internet (and its descendants), unless
&gt; the strongest possible protections are adopted.  (And it is equally
&gt; easy to imagine who the biggest winners and losers will be.)
&gt; 
&gt; Relying on government to protect personal privacy is like appointing
&gt; the fox to guard the henhouse (or, as I seem to recall John Perry
&gt; Barlow once putting it, "... getting a peeping tom to install your
&gt; window blinds," or something like that).  In addition to the
&gt; government's own motivations for eroding privacy, all the above
&gt; economic considerations enter into government through lobbying,
&gt; desires to maximize tax revenues, fund-raising considerations, and a
&gt; whole raft of other avenues.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, the only tools which government could bring to bear would
&gt; be a complex web of laws and regulations governing the circulation of
&gt; personal data.  Such laws and regulations would have to constantly
&gt; shift in a never ending cat-and-mouse game with business; and what's
&gt; more, many of these laws and regulations would necessarily conflict
&gt; with the free speech rights of private organizations.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line: Anonymity is the only available tool which puts control
&gt; over my own privacy firmly into my own hands, where it belongs, and
&gt; does so without infringing on anyone's freedom of speech.  Certainly
&gt; there are drawbacks, and anonymity may invite some abuses; but we have
&gt; survived anonymity's problems in the past, and 'tis better to suffer
&gt; in the hell we know than to be dragged into a new and hotter one.  The
&gt; only society without any crime is a society without any freedom.
&gt; 
&gt; My ($.02) conclusion: For preserving meaningful privacy, and for
&gt; preventing an ugly and probably irreversible transformation of our
&gt; world, anonymity is the best, perhaps the only viable tool we have.
