Here is a text version of an essay on Mixmaster and remailers in general.
I am going to try to put this in HTML and stick it on my home page.
If you want the original Mac version (distributed at today's San Diego
Cypherpunks meeting) let me know (Word 5.0). The list software has been
balking when I try to post in MIME encoded. The figures will be in the
HTML, and are in the Mac version.

--------------------------------
**Cypherpunk remailers.

The structure of current remailer messages is a nested set of encrypted
messages. Each message is encrypted to a remailer. The message contains the
instructions for each remailer (such as where to send the message next) and
the message to be forwarded. Each remailer removes a layer of encryption,
and accompanying instructions, takes any requested actions, and sends the
message on to the next destination.

Figure 1

The figure above graphically represents a message that will be sent through
3 remailers (A,B,C) and finally to Bob. The boxes represent encryption,
with the name of the person to whom the message is encrypted is outside the
upper left corner of the box. One important fact is immediately clear from
this diagram; the message shrinks after each hop.

Cypherpunk remailers do several things:
        Send a message to another email address or post it to a new group.
        Accepts encrypted messages with instructions for processing hidden
          inside the encrypted envelope.
        Strip of all (or at least some) mail headers.
        Add new headers (like subject lines).
        Remove some information from the end of the message.
        Encrypt part of the message using a key specified in the message.

Some but not all remailers can also do the following:
        Hold messages for some fixed or random time (latency).
        Reorder messages keeping a fixed minimum number in the remailer at
all times.


**Attacks on Cypherpunk remailers.

Since anonymous remailers are designed to prevent traffic analysis, the
best way to understand their weaknesses is to study various attacks that an
opponent might use against them. I will assume a very powerful opponent,
both to present a worst case scenario, and because it is possible to resist
these attacks using second generation remailers.

*Threat model.
I assume that an attacker is able to record the contents of all messages
into and out of all remailers, along with the times they arrive and depart.
All messages are monitored as they leave the sender's machine, and as they
arrive at the destination. The attacker is able to send an unlimited number
of messages through the remailers, including previously intercepted
messages. Messages can also be prevented from arriving at their
destinations (denial of service). The attacker has compromised some (but
not all) of the remailers, and knows the source, destination, and contents
of all messages passing through the compromised remailers. This set of
attacker abilities and resources is the threat model.

*Trivial Attacks.
From the threat model it is prima facie obvious that unencrypted messages
can be tracked, so I will consider only encrypted communications.
The use of only one remailer is also insecure. If that remailer is
compromised, you have no security because the operator knows both the
originating and final addresses.

*Reordering.
Chains of remailers with encryption are better, but still vulnerable.
Messages can be traced through these remailers, because incoming messages
are forwarded directly after processing. When a message arrives, another
leaves immediately.  With no further information the attacker knows that
these are the same message despite any precautions that may have been
taken. This can even be done retroactively using mail logs (if those are
kept).

This is the biggest problem with standard Cypherpunk remailers. The first
fix proposed was to delay incoming messages for some random length of time.
If this time were longer than the time between message arrivals, then it
would be impossible to know (with certainty) which incoming message
corresponded to which outgoing message. This proposal Is weak in several
respects. The exact amount of protection provided by latency is unknown. It
depends on the traffic through the remailer at that time. If there are many
messages arriving in the average holding time, then the identity of the
message is reasonably well disguised, but if there is very little traffic
(due to normal fluctuations, network outages, or denial of service attacks)
then little or no protection is provided. To provide some minimum level of
protection, considering only normal traffic variations, the latency must be
much larger than it would have to be at times maximum traffic.

Although reordering solves this problem, it also opens up another possible
attack. Reordering always involves keeping some number of messages in the
remailer at all times. These messages are called the message "pool." The
most efficient reordering scheme is to keep N messages in the pool, and to
send out one of the (N+1) messages in the pool (including the one that just
arrived) chosen at random. Unfortunately this scheme is susceptible to a
"spam" attack.
An attacker sends many more than N messages to the remailer. These messages
will displace all the real messages in the pool, leaving only messages
which the attacker can recognize.If many more than N messages are sent to a
remailer then the its pool of messages will contain only planted messages
(which can be recognized). If the attacker sends another batch of messages
after your message arrives, your message will be flushed back out of the
pool. Since the attacker can recognize his own message, yours will be
obvious.

Combining latency and reordering gives some resistance to this attack.
Rather than sending out one message from the pool each time a new message
arrives, periodically all but N messages in the pool are sent. If, during
an average period, several real messages have arrived then even if the pool
of messages if flushed out, there will be more than just your message mixed
in with the attacker's messages.
If the attacker combines the spam with a denial of service attack, then
your message would be the only non-attacker message again. There is nothing
you can do if the attacker can ensure that yours is the only message
traversing the entire network of remailers. With ideal remailers your
message could be any one of the messages passing through any remailer at
the same time. If yours is the only message passing through the remailer
network, then you are toast.

*Size &amp; Distinguishability.
Suppose now that your message is chained through remailers that are
delaying and reordering at every hop. Your messages can still be tracked by
size.  By default messages decreases in size by a small (and approximately
known) amount at each hop. Even if your message is well mixed with the
other messages in the remailer, and even if they are all different sizes,
they are still distinguishable. It is possible to have the remailer remove
padding from the message at each hop, but this only to decreases the size
of the message, and only to a minimum established by the size of the actual
message you want to send. You are also limited by the fact that extremely
large messages will stand out, since your message must change size by a
large fraction of its own size at each hop to ensure maximum confusion.
While removing padding at each step makes traffic analysis much more
difficult, it does leak information. All messages that leave a remailer
larger than your message was when it arrived are known not to be yours, and
if the use of this feature is unusual, then your message will stand out as
being the only one to change size by a nonstandard amount. The solution is
clear; All messages should be exactly the same size.

*Replay attacks
Unfortunately reordered, indistinguishable messages, can still be tracked.
This attack can be used to follow a message to its final destination, or to
backtrack from the end to the original sender. Both of these techniques use
a type of spam attack. To trace a message forward through the chain of
remailers, the attacker captures your message and sends many copies of it
to the first remailer. Many identical messages will then emerge from the
remailer and move on to the next remailer. This bump in remailer traffic
will show the rout of the message. When it becomes too dispersed from
reordering, the message can be captured between two remailers, and many
copies re-introduced at that point.

To prevent this attack remailers must refuse to send any message more than
once. This can be done by including a random ID number for each hop, which
the remailer records. Unfortunately this places large storage demands on
the remailer, but the impact can be limited if old IDs are removed from the
list, or the remailer's key is changed periodically (at which point the
list can be cleared). A better solution is to require anonymous ecash
postage in each layer. If the message is resent, then the cash has been
doubly spent, and the remailer would refuse to send it. This also has the
benefit of making spams expensive, and of motivating remailer operators to
provide superior services.


**Mixmaster.

The only type 2 remailer is Mixmaster. Its design philosophy is strongly
influenced by Chaum's paper on digital mixes (the origin of its name).
Below is a diagram of the structure of a Mixmaster packet. Rather than 4
there are actually 20 headers. Messages are sent as one or more packets
(messages consisting of multiple packets are called multi-part messages).

Figure 2

When remailer A gets this message, it will decrypt the PGP encrypted packet
at the top, and check to see if it has seen the ID number before. If so,
the message is discarded. The first header (before decryption) is added to
the end of the list of headers, and all the others are shifted up one. All
headers and the body packet (the section at the end with the text to be
sent) are decrypted with the IDEA key in the header. This reveals a PGP
encrypted header for the next remailer at the top, and obscures the old top
header (now at the bottom of the stack).

The header for the last remailer in the chain contains a flag indicating
that it is the last hop, and if it is part of a multipart message. If this
packet contains the entire message (it is not a multi-part message), the
body is decrypted and the plain text is placed in the reordering pool,
ready to be sent on. If it is only one part of the message, the Message ID
number is used to identify the other parts as they arrive. When all the
parts have arrived the message is reassembled, and placed in the pool. If
not all parts arrive within some time limit, then the message is discarded.
Only the last remailer in the chain can see that a group of remailer
packets are all part of a single message. To all the others, they are
completely independent.

All Mixmaster packets are exactly the same length, and all bits are
encrypted with an IDEA key at every hop, so no information about the
identity of the message is visible to the observer. Even a compromised
remailer can only know the previous and next locations in the chain. It can
not know how many hops have preceded it, or how many will follow (unless it
is the final hop).

These messages are rather large. Each of the 20 headers are 512 bytes, and
the body is 10k. The plain text is compressed to minimize the need for
multipart messages, which offer somewhat less security because all parts
follow the same chain of remailers.

*Future features
In the near future the Mixmaster user front end will allow the individual
packets of a multipart message to be routed independently.
Mixmaster remailers that indicate that they can accept socket connections
will exchange messages directly. The messages will be superencrypted with
an IDEA key derived from a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This provides
forward security against remailer operators being asked to decrypt
intercepted messages.


**Nothing is perfect.

Even if you are using a perfect network of remailers, you can still be
tracked. Only so many messages pass through the network of remailers in any
given day. If Alice sending a message usualy correlates with Bob receiving
a message, it is likely that she is sending messages to him. This was
discussed in some detail in several messages by Hal and Louis Cypher. One
defense is to send dummy messages in to the remailer "bramble" so your
messages correlate with everything. These must be sent at random times so
that your real messages do not stand out.
