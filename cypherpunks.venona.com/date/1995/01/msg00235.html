&gt; ten is not a large number when it comes o cross-posting on soem topics, I 
&gt; can think of at lezast tewenty newsgroups where the PRZ letters and such

&gt; soemtimes reactionar steps people take to control spamming.  it leads to 
&gt; people getting hurt, especially whent he sysop at your site is nto 
&gt; intelligent enough to look aat the article, and see wether or not it was 
&gt; cross-posted to valid groups etc..and not only that, but to completely 
&gt; pull your account for such a small thing(ten groups?  that's nothing in 
&gt; comparison to some aticles out there still going) What is the name of the 
&gt; sysop at that site your account was pulled form?  
&gt;  
His name is Michael Horwath, root@winternet.com

&gt; &gt; But to take my account away for crossposting to 10 groups is not right.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I agree, ten groups is a small amount, especially if they are at least 
&gt; amrginally on topic.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is soemthing that we need to watch out for tho, it makes people 
&gt; fearful of spreadung information, when evenif you spread it in a nice 
&gt; manner, to on-topic groups etc.. that you face the chance of some bozo 
&gt; net-vigilante complaining to your sysop and having your account yanked. 
&gt; &gt;From teh evidence here it seems the sysop acted in a reactionary manner, 
&gt; probably out of fear of some asshole mailbombing your account.  
&gt; 
&gt; I heartily reccomend that those of you who do not know your sites 
&gt; policies for such, become aquainted with them, or at least contact the 
&gt; syspo and talk about this issue.  If you contact him and talk to him(her) 
&gt; about it then they are less likely to react so quickly and IMO stupidly.  
&gt; It's amazing how much just knowing your sysops first name helps in such a 
&gt; situation.
&gt; 
&gt; As for MCs, I am not sure of their policies but Karl is very reliable, 
&gt; and I doubt he would be so reactionary, in any case, I'll contact him 
&gt; about such policies.
