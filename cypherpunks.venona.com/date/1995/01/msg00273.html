&gt;Robert H. has asked that we reply in e-mail to him, to avoid

Got that right. No one can be more chagrined than I about this, because
I've seen it happen. I remember Way Back in Ancient History (1985) when
someone who couldn't remember the name of the movie posted the plot to
"Slient Running" to net.sf(?), and asked for e-mail answers, so it
"wouldn't clog the newsgroup". He was begging for mercy as little as 4
hours later... How soon they forget. I'm lucky it didn't happen to me.
Thanks Tim, for saving my bacon.

Nonetheless, I *am* thankful to Jim Gillogly, who sent me a great bunch of
stuff about what the pentium.whistleblower, Dr. Nicely, was working on. Jim
said he got it out of WWW, and maybe he'll post the URL here and that will
be that. Nicely was working with finding multiple primes: Prime twins,
prime triplets, etc.

I will now proceed to post the relevant bits of Jim's and Tim's stuff to
the newsgroup I got "called" in. Thanks to everyone who sent me comments,
pointers, etc.

&gt;Not to sound strident, but if folks would keep copies of articles and
&gt;spend some time organizing them in data bases or in other searchable
&gt;forms, this would help the list. In my opinion, having personal access
&gt;to past posts is several orders of magnitude more important than
&gt;having MIDI-MIME JPEG-II TeX players that can display "Cypherpunks R
&gt;Us" in the correct font and with the "R" reversed according to spec.

Indeed.

Having limited space on my poor PowerBook, I have kept mostly the "excrable
e$" types of files, to wit: anything mentioning money, finance, economics,
and whatever crypto is specific to those areas.

Since I started hanging out here this spring, I've accumulated about 10
megs of stuff between this list and www-buyinfo. I just archived everything
from November backwards into Stuffit-compressed Eudora mailboxes. If you
want those, I've got 'em. I did search the files I have after the "great
squeeze", but to no avail. Unfortunately, I did not think I would have to
keep anything to do with WIntel and their potential tribulations. I am,
after all a Certified Macintosh BigotÅ.

Thanks again, everyone.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
