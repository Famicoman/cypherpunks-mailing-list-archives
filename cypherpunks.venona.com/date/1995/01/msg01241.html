This came to the machttp_talk list and though it was appropriate here:
******************************
&gt;&gt;Subject: Modem Use Fees
&gt;
&gt;Here is some info that was forwarded to me that all Arts Mgt
&gt;List readers will find interesting. Please act accordingly. Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;Two years ago the FCC tried and (with your help and letters of
&gt;protest) failed to institute regulations that would impose
&gt;additional costs on modem users for data communications. Now,
&gt;they are at it again. A new regulation that the FCC is quietly
&gt;working on will directly affect you as the user of a computer and
&gt;modem. The FCC proposes that users of modems should pay extra
&gt;charges for use of the public telephone network which carry their
&gt;data. In addition, computer network services such as CompuServ,
&gt;Tymnet, &amp; Telenet would also be charged as much as $6.00 per hour
&gt;per user for use of the public telephone network. These charges
&gt;would very likely be passed on to the subscribers. The money is
&gt;to be collected and given to the telephone company in an effort
&gt;to raise funds lost to deregulation.  Jim Eason of KGO newstalk
&gt;radio (San Francisco, CA) commented on the proposal during his
&gt;afternoon radio program during which, he said he learned of the
&gt;new regulation in an article in the New York Times. Jim took the
&gt;time to gather addresses which are given below.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Here's what you should do (NOW!):
&gt;
&gt;1-Pass this information on. Capture the information which
&gt;contains the text you are reading now. Find other BBS's that are
&gt;not carrying this  information. Upload the ASCII text into public
&gt;message on the  BBS, and  also upload the file itself so others
&gt;can easily get a copy to pass along.
&gt;
&gt;2-Print out three copies of the letter which follows (or write
&gt;yours down) and send a signed copy to each of the following:
&gt;
&gt;       Chairman of the FCC
&gt;       1919 M Street N.W.
&gt;       Washington, D.C. 20554
&gt;
&gt;       Chairman, Senate Communication Subcommittee
&gt;       SH-227 Hart Building
&gt;       Washington, D.C. 20510
&gt;
&gt;       Chairman, House Telecommunication Subcommittee
&gt;       B-331 Rayburn Building
&gt;
&gt;Here's the suggested text of the letter to send:
&gt;
&gt;Dear Sir:
&gt;
&gt;Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC
&gt;proposal which would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems
&gt;on the telephone network. This regulation is nothing less than an
&gt;attempt to restrict the free exchange of information among the
&gt;growing number of computer users. Calls placed using modems
&gt;require no special telephone equipment, and users of modems pay
&gt;the phone company for use of the network in the form of a monthly
&gt;bill.
&gt;
&gt;In short, a modem call is the same as a voice call and
&gt;therefore should not be subject to any additional regulation.
&gt;
&gt;       Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;                              ***************
&gt;
&gt;It is important that you act now. The bureaucrats already have
&gt;it in their heads that modem users should subsidize the phone
&gt;company and are now listening to public comment. Please stand up
&gt;and make it clear that we will not stand for any government
&gt;restriction on the free exchange of information.
&gt;
&gt;Please deal with this in a TIMELY manner. We can't wait and
&gt;watch, or we will be walked over by government regulations that
&gt;are trying to strangle us.
