SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  

I.  Issues for Public Comment

A.   Background 

     The public meetings are part of an ongoing dialogue with the
Administration to assess the security needs and concerns of users
of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  The NII is a
system of high-speed telecommunications networks, databases, and
advanced computer systems that will make electronic information
more widely available and accessible than ever before.  For
example, citizens may be able to learn about federal benefits
programs through public kiosks, or may receive their social
security payments through direct deposit to their bank accounts. 
As the U.S. transportation infrastructure becomes more complex,
Americans will benefit from the application of information
technologies to such operations as toll collection, motor vehicle
registration, and traffic routing.  This increased availability
and accessibility of services and products provided through
information technology will dramatically affect the way in which
individuals conduct their everyday affairs. 

     Consequently, broad public and commercial use of the NII
hinges upon implementing technologies, policies, and practices
that not only ensure that users of information systems have
access to information when and where they need it, but that
subjects of information records are able to protect themselves
from unauthorized or inappropriate use of information.    

     "Americans will not use the NII to its full potential unless
they trust that information will go where and when they want it
and nowhere else," declared Sally Katzen, Administrator of the
Office of Information Regulatory Affairs at OMB and chair of the
Forum.  "The Federal government is a primary user of the NII and
thus a catalyst for change.  Yet the NII will be designed, built,
owned, operated, and used primarily by the private sector, making
it essential that security on the NII be considered in
partnership with the public."

     To address these critical issues, the Vice President formed
the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF).  The IITF is
chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and is comprised of
senior Administration officials having expertise in technical,
legal, and policy areas pertinent to the NII.  The mission of the
IITF is to articulate and implement the Administration's vision
for the NII.  

     The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the
IITF to address the cross-cutting issue of security in the NII. 
The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management
and Budget.  

     In addition to the IITF, the President has established the
U.S. Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure. 
The Advisory Council represents industry, labor, and public
interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce on issues
relating to the NII.  Mega-Project III, one of three work groups
of the Advisory Council, is responsible for addressing security,
intellectual property, and privacy issues as they relate to the
NII.

B.   Structure and Content of Public Meeting

     Security is linked inextricably to broad public use of the
NII.  The technologies, policies, and procedures used to ensure
the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally
produced and transmitted information, information products, and
services on the NII will determine whether, how, and to what
extent digitally linked information services will be broadly used
in such critical applications as providing public information,
supporting the delivery of government services, utilizing
intelligent transportation systems, and conducting trade. 

     Development of policies and procedures that will ensure the
security of public and private information and communications on
the NII requires study from different perspectives, whether that
of the subject of the information, the user of the information,
or the creator of the information.  The Forum and Mega-Project
III seek input from parties representing beneficiaries of federal
information and services and users of intelligent transportation
systems and trade data.

     Solutions to these concerns will come via technical
solutions, as well as legal and policy mechanisms.  The Forum and
Mega-Project III seek input in this area as well.  Specifically,
what legal measures, policy mechanisms, and technological
solutions, or combinations thereof, can be used to effectively
protect the security of federal benefits information or
transportation or trade data, delivered or made accessible on the
NII?  

     A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will be assembled
to discuss the following topics with a panel of senior
Administration officials, members of the Security Issues Forum,
members of the Advisory Council, and policy makers at the State
level, and to field questions and comments from other members of
the public.  

     Position statements for the meeting, "Security in the
Delivery of Electronic Information and Services," should address
four principal questions:  

1.   How do you envision the NII being used to provide services   
  and information electronically to citizens?  Specifically,     
what types of services and information should be delivered     
or made available? 

2.   What risks and threats do you foresee in making services and 
    information available via the NII?  Such threats might     
include fraud, unauthorized access, breach of
     confidentiality or privacy, breach of integrity, and system  
   performance.

3.   What legal, policy, and ethical issues do you foresee
     affecting usage of the NII?  Such issues may include
     liability, information/property rights, access,
     document/records management, legal admissibility/evidentiary 
    requirements, and auditability.  Do some issues, such as     
privacy and open access, tend to countervene each other? 

4.   What kinds of administrative or technical solutions should   
  be developed or promoted to address security, legal, and     
ethical concerns?  Such solutions may include verifying     
recipient and/or vendor eligibility, ensuring operational     
and systems security, and establishing means to facilitate     
settlement, detection, and prosecution.  

     Position statements for the meeting, "Security for
Intelligent Transportation Systems and Trade Information," should
address five principal questions:

1.   Who should be permitted access to sensitive trade and
     transportation information systems?  How can inappropriate   
  access and use be prevented?

2.   What technical and institutional safeguards in electronic    
 data transmission, storage, and retrieval are needed to     
protect the security of trade and transportation data?  Such     
risks might include:  disclosure of proprietary and
     confidential business information, criminal access to trade  
   and cargo records, disclosure of individual travel patterns    
 or vehicle locations, or disclosure of transportation
     dispatch communications regarding sensitive cargo shipment   
  routes, itineraries, and locations.

3.   What does an "appropriate level of security" consist of?  Is 
    there a "one-size-fits-all" solution, or can policies be     
established which flexibly meet diverse needs?
  
4.   Do certain systems merit greater degrees of security
     protection, such as traffic signal control systems, variable 
    message signs, fleet location monitoring, electronic toll     
collection, international trade data, and motor vehicle     
registration records?  
 
5.   Who should establish and enforce security policies?  How can 
    government and the private sector work together to support a  
   secure National Information Infrastructure?

II.  Guidelines for Participation in the Public Hearing

     Individuals who would like to participate on a panel must
request an opportunity to do so no later than January 20, 1995,
