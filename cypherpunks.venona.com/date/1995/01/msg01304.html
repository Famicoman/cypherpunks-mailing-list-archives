[Some initial stuff seems missing, sorry.]

&gt;  ``No.''
&gt;
&gt;  And so it went. Once the security configuration is established and the
&gt;security profiles are put in a database-like protected file system,
&gt;accessing that data to get a full view of the security policy implementation
&gt;is near impossible. An administrator must retrieve individually each piece
&gt;of data stored in the security database, then manually collate and compile
&gt;it into a usable form.
&gt;
&gt;  In a large operation, the security administrator will build a security
&gt;database by virtue of the number of objects and characteristics assigned to
&gt;each object during configuration. But Windows NT offers little way to access
&gt;and manipulate that database for analysis, rapid reconfiguration or global
&gt;views. It appears, and Microsoft engineers agree, someone will have to build
&gt;a utility program to take advantage of the security database via the maze of
&gt;APIs available to third-party developers.
&gt;
&gt;  Kevin Phaup, program manager lead of Microsoft's Business Systems
&gt;Division, put the best spin he could on this first major Windows NT
&gt;shortcoming. ``Pull the data into a database and then massage it,'' he said.
&gt;``We have a new product - System Management Server from the Back Office
&gt;Suite - that could help.''
&gt;
&gt;  I agree, but why would I want to buy a brand-new operating system that
&gt;needs help out of the box?
&gt;
&gt;  What's more, the third-party database solution for security administration
&gt;is a hopeless short-term patch. To be truly effective, it needs a much
&gt;tighter integration with Windows NT's APIs to permit not only systemic
&gt;analysis, but also systemic security changes based on selected criteria.
&gt;
&gt;  If administrators want to change the access rights of every user so they
&gt;can log on at 7 a.m. instead of 8 a.m., they cannot do it with Windows NT
&gt;3.5. They might be able to do it with a third-party product or with Windows
&gt;NT 4.0.
&gt;
&gt;  ``If someone builds an administration product like that, they'll make a
&gt;lot of money,'' Phaup says.
&gt;
&gt;  A  WEEKEND'S  WORK  Windows NT has other security problems, as well. For
&gt;example, it does not have data cryptography, which is essential to make sure
&gt;a network is reasonably secure from eavesdropping and integrity breaches.
&gt;Microsoft, which knows encryption technology, easily could have included the
&gt;appropriate algorithms in software to make Windows NT more secure.
&gt;
&gt;  Microsoft's Phaup agrees it would have been simple to add encryption to
&gt;Windows NT. ``The hooks are all there,'' he said.
&gt;
&gt;  But Windows NT does not need cryptography for C2 certification. And
&gt;perhaps even more telling, Microsoft cannot export cryptography outside the
&gt;U.S. due to export control laws that prohibit it from doing so without
&gt;licensing. Of course, the company could have made two versions of Windows
&gt;NT: one with crytography for domestic use and one without cryptography for
&gt;export.
&gt;
&gt;  According to Phaup, Microsoft was reluctant to do so for two reasons.
&gt;``Security is way down on the list of corporate concerns and desires and
&gt;wants in an OS. It's in the top 20, but not the top 3,'' he says. ``And the
&gt;testing cycle would have been a double killer.''
&gt;
&gt;  Windows NT's last major shortcoming lays in the omission of a feature that
&gt;most security experts consider virtually indispensable: boot control.
&gt;
&gt;  In the DOS/Windows world, third-party PC security is reasonably attempted
&gt;by forcing users to boot from the C drive and making them log on with IDs
&gt;and passwords. However, if a bootable DOS diskette is inserted in the A
&gt;drive, the PC will boot without a logon, and the A:&gt; will appear.
&gt;
&gt;  But if the user attempts to log over to the C drive, the system will come
&gt;back with a message such as: Invalid drive specification. Security experts
&gt;recognize this as an inexpensive technique that will keep out casual
&gt;intruders and nontechnical types.
&gt;
&gt;  One way to mandate boot control is with a hardware or firmware addition to
&gt;the PC in the form of an add-on card. The hardware boot process is
&gt;interrupted, and then even access to the A drive can be restricted until the
&gt;actual logon process through the legal boot drive has been successfully
&gt;completed.
&gt;
&gt;  In Windows NT, boot control does not even exist as an option. Again, this
&gt;suggests that Microsoft's security effort was driven by C2 certification,
&gt;not by security itself.
&gt;
&gt;  In its defense, there is a lot to like about Windows NT and the plethora
&gt;of functionality it offers from the application standpoint. But Windows NT
&gt;sorely lacks in security, so much so that it almost would be safer not to
&gt;use any security.
&gt;
&gt;  Windows NT must evolve quickly to garner a spot in the secure operating
&gt;system arsenal or somehow steal market share from the likes of Novell. It
&gt;just is not there yet. But Microsoft's Phaup left me with one closing
&gt;thought. ``Have you talked to the Cairo [Windows 95.5] guys yet?''
