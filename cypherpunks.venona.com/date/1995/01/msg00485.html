                               Keep Out
                  The Journal of Electronic Privacy
                           January 10, 1995


    ** Keep Out Volume 1, Number 2 now available electronically **
            ** Keep Out Volume 2, Number 1 coming soon **
                  ** FREE sample issues available **


I am pleased to announce the electronic availability of Volume 1,
Number 2 of Keep Out, the Journal of Electronic Privacy.

To receive a copy, simply send e-mail to
keep-out-current@expressnet.org.  The subject and body of the message
do not matter.  You will receive an ASCII-text copy of the issue in
reply to your message.  You can also do a Fidonet file request to
1:102/903 and request VOL1-NO2.TXT, or call the Sprawl BBS at
+1-818-342-5127 and download it.

Volume 1, Number 2 had stories on the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
signature bug, a how-to story on anonymous remailers, an interview
with remailer operator Erich von Hollander, and of course, a
continuation of our PGP beginners' series with an introduction to
digital signatures and the web of trust.

While Keep Out is primarily a paper magazine, the text of each issue
is released electronically to make sure the information is
disseminated widely.  This information is too important to limit it
to those who can afford a subscription.

I am sending this message instead of posting the full text of Keep
Out because the electronic edition contains the same commercial
advertisements that the paper version does.  It would be
inappropriate to post it here.

To encourage people to subscribe, and to ensure that Keep Out remains
solvent, the electronic edition is released roughly one month after
the paper version.

It seems to be the lot of new magazines to have deadline troubles.
Keep Out has unfortunately been no exception.  The second issue of
Keep Out was released quite late.  To bring the magazine's date of
issue back in touch with reality, the next issue (Volume 2, Number
1) will be dated March/April, and will be released in paper form on
February 27.

For that issue, we are working on a review of steganography software
(programs for hiding data in sound and picture files), an in-depth
report on Tempest technology (which allows an eavesdropper to view
your computer screen from a distance without using wires), a story
telling the current state of the government's Clipper (wiretap) Chip
initiative, and a continuation of our PGP for beginners' series.

To receive a free, sample issue of Keep Out, with no strings
attached, simply send your postal address to one of the addresses
below.  You will receive a copy of the next issue when it is mailed
out.  Keep Out's mailing list is completely confidential.  No
information about you will be released for any reason, except for
court orders, of course.

Subscriptions to Keep Out are $15 a year for six issues in the U.S.
and Canada, $27 elsewhere.  Back issues of the first two issues
(Volume 1, Numbers 1 and 2) are available at $7 each inside the U.S.
and Canada, $9 elsewhere.  U.S. funds only, please.  Unfortunately, we
can not accept credit cards, but checks and money orders payable to
"Keep Out" are welcome.
