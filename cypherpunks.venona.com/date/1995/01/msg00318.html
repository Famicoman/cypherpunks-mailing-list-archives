&gt; &gt;Phil,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Could you repost here the address where we can send our support?

&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;             Phil Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund Appeal
&gt; 
&gt;     In November, 1976, Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie announced
&gt; their discovery of public-key cryptography by beginning their paper
&gt; with the sentence: "We stand today on the brink of a revolution in
&gt; cryptography."
&gt; 
&gt;     We stand today on the brink of an important battle in the
&gt; revolution they unleased.  Philip Zimmermann, who encoded and released
&gt; the most popular and successful program to flow from that discovery,
&gt; Pretty Good Privacy ("PGP"), may be about to go to court.
&gt; 
&gt;     It has been over fourteen months now since Phil was first informed
&gt; that he was the subject of a grand jury investigation being mounted by
&gt; the San Jose, CA, office of US Customs into the international
&gt; distribution, over the Internet, of the original version of the
&gt; program.  On January 12th, Phil's legal team will meet for the first
&gt; time with William Keane, Assistant US Attorney for the Northern
&gt; District of California, who is in charge of the grand jury
&gt; investigation, in San Jose.  An indictment, if one is pursued by the
&gt; government after this meeting, could be handed down very shortly
&gt; thereafter.
&gt; 
&gt;     If indicted, Phil would likely be charged with violating statute 22
&gt; USC 2778 of the US Code, "Control of arms exports and imports."  This
&gt; is the federal statute behind the regulation known as ITAR,
&gt; "International Traffic in Arms Regulations," 22 CFR 120.1 et seq. of
&gt; the Code of Federal Regulations.  Specifically, the indictment would
&gt; allege that Phil violated 22 USC 2778 by exporting an item listed as a
&gt; "munition" in 22 CFR 120.1 et seq. without having a license to do so.
&gt; That item is cryptographic software -- PGP.
&gt; 
&gt;     At stake, of course, is far more than establishing whether Phil
&gt; violated federal law or not.  The case presents significant issues and
&gt; will establish legal precedent, a fact known to everyone involved.
&gt; According to his lead counsel, Phil Dubois, the US government hopes to
&gt; establish the proposition that anyone having anything at all to do with
&gt; an illegal export -- even someone like Phil, whose only involvement was
&gt; writing the program and making it available to US citizens and who has
&gt; no idea who actually exported it -- has committed a federal felony
&gt; offense.  The government also hopes to establish the proposition that
&gt; posting a "munition" on a BBS or on the Internet is exportation.  If
&gt; the government wins its case, the judgment will have a profound
&gt; chilling effect on the US software industry, on the free flow of
&gt; information on the emerging global networks, and in particular upon the
&gt; grassroots movement to put effective cryptography in the hands of
&gt; ordinary citizens.  The US government will, in effect, resurrect
&gt; Checkpoint Charlie -- on the Information Superhighway.
&gt; 
&gt;     By now, most of us who are reading this know about Phil and the
&gt; case, whether by having the program and reading the doc files or by
&gt; seeing reports in the Wall Steet Journal, Time, Scientific American,
&gt; the New York Times, Wired, US News and World Report, and hundreds of
&gt; other news outlets; on Usenet groups like talk.crypto.politics or
&gt; alt.security.pgp; or by listening to Phil give talks such as the one he
&gt; gave at CFP '94 in Chicago.  We know that PGP has made great strides
&gt; since version 1.0, and is now a sophisticated encryption and
&gt; key-management package which has become the de facto standard in both
&gt; micro and mainframe environments.  We know that Phil and the PGP
&gt; development team successfully negotiated a commercial license with
&gt; Viacrypt, and, through the efforts of MIT, a noncommercial license for
&gt; PGP with RSA Data Security, the holders of the patent on the RSA
&gt; algorithm on which PGP is based, thus freeing the program from the
&gt; shadow of allegations of patent infringement.  We know that programs
&gt; such as PGP represent one of our best bulwarks in the Information Age
&gt; against the intrusions of public and private information gatherers.  We
&gt; know that PGP is a key tool in insuring that the "Information
&gt; Superhighway" will open the world to us, without opening us to the
&gt; world.
&gt; 
&gt;     What we may not all know is the price Phil has had to pay for his
&gt; courage and willingness to challenge the crypto status quo.  For years
&gt; now Phil has been the point man in the ongoing campaign for freely
&gt; available effective cryptography for the everyday computer user.  The
&gt; costs, personal and professional, to him have been great.  He wrote the
&gt; original code for PGP 1.0 by sacrificing months of valuable time from
&gt; his consulting career and exhausting his savings.  He continues to
&gt; devote large amounts of his time to testifying before Congress, doing
&gt; public speaking engagements around the world, and agitating for
&gt; "cryptography for the masses," largely at his own expense.  He is now
&gt; working, still for free, on the next step in PGP technology, PGP Phone,
&gt; which will turn every PC with a sound card and a modem into a secure
&gt; telephone.  And we know that, just last month, he was searched and
&gt; interrogated in the absence of counsel by US Customs officials upon his
&gt; return from a speaking tour in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt;     Phil's legal team consists of his lead counsel, Philip Dubois of
&gt; Boulder, CO; Kenneth Bass of Venable, Baetjer, Howard &amp; Civiletti, in
&gt; Washington, DC, first counsel for intelligence policy for the Justice
&gt; Department under President Carter; Eben Moglen, professor of law at
&gt; Columbia and Harvard Universities; Curt Karnow, a former assistant US
&gt; attorney and intellectual property law specialist at Landels, Ripley &amp;
&gt; Diamond in San Francisco; and Thomas Nolan, noted criminal defense
&gt; attorney in Menlo Park.
&gt; 
&gt;     While this is a stellar legal team, what makes it even more
&gt; extraordinary is that several of its members have given their time for
&gt; free to Phil's case.  Still, while their time has been donated so far,
&gt; other expenses -- travel, lodging, telephone, and other costs -- have
&gt; fallen to Phil.  If the indictment is handed down, time and costs will
&gt; soar, and the members of the team currently working pro bono may no
&gt; longer be able to.  Justice does not come cheap in this country, but
&gt; Phil deserves the best justice money can buy him.
&gt; 
&gt;     This is where you and I come in.  Phil Dubois estimates that the
&gt; costs of the case, leaving aside the lawyers' fees, will run from
&gt; US$100,000 - $150,000.  If Phil's team must charge for their services,
&gt; the total cost of the litigation may range as high as US$300,000.  The
&gt; legal defense fund is already several thousand dollars in the red and
&gt; the airline tickets to San Jose haven't even been purchased yet.
&gt; 
&gt;     In September, 1993 I wrote a letter urging us all to support Phil,
&gt; shortly after the first subpoenas were issued by Customs.  Today the
&gt; need is greater than ever, and I'm repeating the call.
&gt; 
&gt;     Phil has assumed the burden and risk of being the first to develop
&gt; truly effective tools with which we all might secure our communications
&gt; against prying eyes, in a political environment increasingly hostile to
&gt; such an idea -- an environment in which Clipper chips and digital
&gt; telephony bills are our own government's answer to our concerns.  Now
&gt; is the time for us all to step forward and help shoulder that burden
&gt; with him.
&gt; 
&gt;     It is time more than ever.  I call on all of us, both here in the
&gt; US and abroad, to help defend Phil and perhaps establish a
&gt; groundbreaking legal precedent.  PGP now has an installed base of
&gt; hundreds of thousands of users.  PGP works.  It must -- no other
&gt; "crypto" package, of the hundreds available on the Internet and BBS's
&gt; worldwide, has ever been subjected to the governmental attention PGP
&gt; has.  How much is PGP worth to you?  How much is the complete security
&gt; of your thoughts, writings, ideas, communications, your life's work,
&gt; worth to you?  The price of a retail application package?i  Send it.
&gt; More?  Send it.  Whatever you can spare: send it.
&gt; 
&gt;     A legal trust fund, the Philip Zimmermann Defense Fund (PZDF), has
&gt; been established with Phil Dubois in Boulder.  Donations will be
&gt; accepted in any reliable form, check, money order, or wire transfer,
&gt; and in any currency, as well as by credit card.
&gt; 
&gt;     You may give anonymously or not, but PLEASE - give generously.  If
&gt; you admire PGP, what it was intended to do and the ideals which
&gt; animated its creation, express your support with a contribution to this
&gt; fund.
&gt; 
&gt;                            *    *    *
&gt; 
&gt;     Here are the details:
&gt; 
&gt;     To send a check or money order by mail, make it payable, NOT to Phil
&gt; Zimmermann, but to "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account."  Mail the
&gt; check or money order to the following address:
&gt; 
&gt;     Philip Dubois
&gt;     2305 Broadway
&gt;     Boulder, CO USA 80304
&gt;     (Phone #: 303-444-3885)
&gt; 
&gt;     To send a wire transfer, your bank will need the following
&gt; information:
&gt; 
&gt;     Bank: VectraBank
&gt;     Routing #: 107004365
&gt;     Account #: 0113830
&gt;     Account Name: "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"
&gt; 
&gt;     Now here's the neat bit.  You can make a donation to the PZDF by
&gt; Internet mail on your VISA or MasterCard.  Worried about snoopers
&gt; intercepting your e-mail?  Don't worry -- use PGP.
&gt; 
&gt;     Simply compose a message in plain ASCII text giving the following:
&gt; the recipient ("Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"); the bank
&gt; name of your VISA or MasterCard; the name which appears on it; a tele-
&gt; phone number at which you can be reached in case of problems; the card
&gt; number; date of expiry; and, most important, the amount you wish to do-
&gt; nate.  (Make this last item as large as possible.) Then use PGP to en-
&gt; crypt and ASCII-armor the message using Phil Dubois's public key, en-
&gt; closed below.  (You can also sign the message if you like.)  E-mail
&gt; the output file to Phil Dubois (dubois@csn.org). Please be sure to use
&gt; a "Subject:" line reading something like "Phil Zimmermann Defense Fund"
&gt; so he'll know to decrypt it right away.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bona fides: My relation to Phil Z. is that of a long-time user and
&gt; advocate of PGP and a personal friend. For over a year I moderated the
&gt; (no longer published) digest, Info-PGP, on the old lucpul.it.luc.edu site
&gt; here at Loyola. I am in no way involved with the administration of the
&gt; PZDF. I volunteer my time on its behalf.
&gt; 	Phil Dubois is Phil Z.'s lawyer and lead counsel in the Customs case.
&gt; He administers the PZDF.
&gt; 	To obtain a copy of my public key (with which you can verify the
&gt; signature on this doc), you have a number of options:
&gt; 	- Use the copy which I will append below.
&gt; 	- Send mail to me at hmiller@luc.edu with the "Subject:" line
&gt; reading "send pubkey"
&gt; 	- Get it by anon ftp at <A  HREF="ftp://ftp.math.luc.edu/pub/hmiller/pubkey.hm">ftp://ftp.math.luc.edu/pub/hmiller/pubkey.hm</A>
&gt; 	- Obtain it from an Internet PGP keyserver machine such as
&gt; pgp-public-keys@pgp.ai.mit.edu. Just send a mail message to this
&gt; address with the "Subject:" field "GET hmiller". Other keyserver
&gt; machines on the Net which accept the same message format (and
&gt; automatically synchronize keyrings with each other every 10 minutes or
&gt; so) include:
&gt; 
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@demon.co.uk
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@pgp.ox.ac.uk
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@ext221.sra.co.jp
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@kub.nl
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@pgp.iastate.edu
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@dsi.unimi.it
&gt; 		pgp-public-keys@pgp.dhp.com
&gt; 
&gt; 	You can verify my public key by calling me at 312-338-2689 (home)
&gt; or 312-508-2727 (office) and letting me read you my key fingerprint
&gt; ("pgp -kvc hmiller" after you have put my key on your pubring.pgp keyring).
&gt; I include it also in my .sig, below, if that's good enough for you.
&gt; 	You might also note that Phil Zimmermann has signed my public key.
&gt; Hopefully he is Node #1 in your Web-of-Trust! His key is available on
&gt; the net keyservers and in the 'keys.asc' file in the PGP distribution
&gt; packages.
&gt; 	Phil Dubois's pubkey can also be obtained from the keyservers, if
&gt; you prefer that source to the text below, and from 'keys.asc'. Phil Z.
&gt; has signed his key as well.
