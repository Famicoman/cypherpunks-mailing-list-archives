First of all, I hope you don't mind me posting this to a couple of 
lists as I find your questions pertinent and should be of value to many 
readers.

	Good question. I don't have an answer at the moment. Maybe someone 
else out there could take this up. (Tim, Eric, Matt??)

> Any way to avoid this?

	See above.

	This is true. The concept of the MX record is to hopefully assist in 
foiling traffic analysis on a casual basis. The MX record idea was not 
meant to totally hide a remailer. It was meant to act as a "casual" 
mask for the remailer.

	I'm open to suggestions on methods to strengthen the masking process.

> To what extent can the operator of such a remailer really hide his
> actual site?

	It depends on the level of control the remailer operator has on the 
site that the remailer operates from.
