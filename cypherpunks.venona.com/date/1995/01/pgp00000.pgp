Hello Everyone,

        Ever since I was forced to discontinue the anonymous remailer
service at jpunix.com, I've been trying to think of a way to continue
servicing the anonymous remailer cause while not having jpunix.com crash
due to remailer overload. Truth be told, as I stating in my parting
announcement, I had to shut down the remailer purely due to load
problems. I didn't shut down the remailer because of any legal threats
or any kind of political issues. I had to shut it down because
jpunix.com is not a Cray with gigabytes of disk space. The issue was a
problem of system load. I received in excess of 1800 spam messages from
various subnets on the Internet during the Christmas holidays.
Jpunix.com crashed every several hours due to this load. Anyway, I hope
this helps to explain my reasons for shutting down.

        Now to the meat of this message... I've been trying to think of
a way that I could still help the remailer cause without actually
having to run a remailer. Tim May and others in Cypherpunks have
alluded to the idea of domain hiding for anonymous remailers. This
sounds like something that an anonymous remailer could benefit from if
the operator chose to do so.

        I would like to offer MX services on jpunix.com for anyone that
would like to make at least a nominal effort to hide the true identity
of their anonymous remailer. How does this work? Let's say that
operator X wants to set up a remailer at invisible.com, but wants to
have it look like it exists elsewhere. Operator X applies for the
domain name pluto.jpunix.com with me. I set up an MX record in my
nameserver so that email sent to pluto.jpunix.com will actually be sent
to invisible.com. That way the remailer at invisible.com can advertise
it's address as being remailer@pluto.jpunix.com.

        If you would like to set up a remailer, or you already have a
remailer and would like to do some simple domain hiding, drop me email
and we can set it up.
