Given the recent discussion on WireD, I thought some of you
might enjoy this editorial (read: rant) authored by Erik Bloodaxe.

Enjoy.

&gt; &gt;Subject--Open Letter to Wired Magazine
&gt; &gt;Date--13 Jan 1995 00:51:09 GMT
&gt; 
&gt; To Whom It May Concern:
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing this under the assumption that the editorial staff at
&gt; Wired will "forget" to print it in the upcoming issue, so I am also
&gt; posting it on every relevant newsgroup and online discussion forum
&gt; that I can think of.
&gt; 
&gt; When I first read your piece "Gang War In Cyberspace" I nearly choked
&gt; on my own stomach bile.  The whole tone of this piece was so far
&gt; removed from reality that I found myself questioning what color the
&gt; sky must be in Wired's universe.  Not that I've come to expect any
&gt; better from Wired.  Your magazine, which could have had the potential
&gt; to actually do something, has become a parody...a politically correct
&gt; art-school project that consistently falls short of telling the whole
&gt; story or making a solid point.  (Just another example of Kapor-Kash
&gt; that ends up letting everyone down.)
&gt; 
&gt; I did however expect more from Josh Quittner.
&gt; 
&gt; I find it interesting that so much emphasis can be placed on an issue
&gt; of supposed racial slurs as the focus of an imaginary "gang war,"
&gt; especially so many years after the fact.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also interesting to me that people keep overlooking the fact that
&gt; one of the first few members of our own little Legion of Doom was
&gt; black (Paul Muad'dib.)  Maybe if he had not died a few years back that
&gt; wouldn't be so quickly forgotten.  (Not that it makes a BIT of
&gt; difference what color a hacker is as long as he or she has a brain and
&gt; a modem, or these days at least a modem.)
&gt; 
&gt; I also find it interesting that a magazine can so easily implicate
&gt; someone as the originator of the so-called "fighting words" that
&gt; allegedly sparked this online-battle, without even giving a second
&gt; thought as to the damage that this may do to the person so named.  One
&gt; would think that a magazine would have more journalistic integrity
&gt; than that (but then again, this IS Wired, and political correctness
&gt; sells magazines and satisfies advertisers.) Thankfully, I'll only have
&gt; to endure one moth of the "Gee Chris, did you know you were a racist
&gt; redneck?" phone calls.
&gt; 
&gt; It's further odd that someone characterized as so sensitive to insults
&gt; allegedly uttered on a party-line could have kept the company he did.
&gt; Strangely enough, Quittner left out all mention of the MOD member who
&gt; called himself "SuperNigger."  Surely, John Lee must have taken
&gt; umbrage to an upper-middle class man of Hebrew descent so shamefully
&gt; mocking him and his entire race, wouldn't he?   Certainly he wouldn't
&gt; associate in any way with someone like that...especially be in the
&gt; same group with, hang out with, and work on hacking projects with,
&gt; would he?
&gt; 
&gt; Please, of course he would, and he did.  (And perhaps he still
&gt; does...)
&gt; 
&gt; The whole "racial issue" was a NON-ISSUE.  However, such things make
&gt; exciting copy and garner many column inches so keep being rehashed.
&gt; In fact, several years back when the issue first came up, the
&gt; statement was cited as being either "Hang up, you nigger," or "Hey,
&gt; SuperNigger," but no one was sure which was actually said.  Funny how
&gt; the wording changes to fit the slant of the "journalist" over time,
&gt; isn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I could say for certain which was actually spoken, but alas, I
&gt; was not privy to such things.  Despite the hobby I supposedly so
&gt; enjoyed according to Quittner, "doing conference bridges," I abhorred
&gt; the things.  We used to refer to them as "Multi-Loser Youps"
&gt; (multi-user loops) and called their denizens "Bridge Bunnies."  The
&gt; bridge referred to in the story was popularzed by the callers of the
&gt; 5A BBS in Houston, Texas.  (A bulletin board, that I never even got
&gt; the chance to call, as I had recently been raided by the Secret
&gt; Service and had no computer.)  Many people from Texas did call the
&gt; BBS, however, and subsequently used the bridge, but so did people from
&gt; Florida, Arizona, Michigan, New York and Louisiana.  And as numbers do
&gt; in the underground, word of a new place to hang out caused it to
&gt; propagate rapidly.
&gt; 
&gt; To make any implications that such things were strictly a New York
&gt; versus Texas issue is ludicrous, and again simply goes to show that a
&gt; "journalist" was looking for more points to add to his (or her)
&gt; particular angle.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not to say that I did not have problems with any of the people
&gt; who were in MOD.  At the time I still harbored strong feelings towards
&gt; Phiber Optik for the NYNEX-Infopath swindle, but that was about it.
&gt; And that was YEARS ago.  (Even I don't harbor a grudge that long.)
&gt; Even the dozen or so annoying phone calls I receied in late 1990 and
&gt; early 1991 did little to evoke "a declaration of war."  Like many
&gt; people, I know how to forward my calls, or unplug the phone.  Amazing
&gt; how technology works, isn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; Those prank calls also had about as much to do with the formation of
&gt; Comsec as bubble-gum had to do with the discovery of nuclear fission.
&gt; (I'm sure if you really put some brain power to it, and consulted
&gt; Robert Anton Wilson, you could find some relationships.)  At the risk
&gt; of sounding glib, we could have cared less about hackers at Comsec.
&gt; If there were no hackers, or computer criminals, there would be no
&gt; need for computer security consultants.  Besides, hackers account for
&gt; so little in the real picture of computer crime, that their existence
&gt; is more annoyance than something to actually fear.
&gt; 
&gt; However, when those same hackers crossed the line and began tapping
&gt; our phone lines, we were more than glad to go after them.  This is one
&gt; of my only rules of action:  do whatever you want to anyone else, but
&gt; mess with me and my livelihood and I will devote every ounce of my
&gt; being to paying you back.  That is exactly what we did.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not to say that we were the only people from the computer
&gt; underground who went to various law enforcement agencies with
&gt; information about MOD and their antics.  In fact, the number of
&gt; hackers who did was staggering, especially when you consider the usual
&gt; anarchy of the underground.  None of these other people ever get
&gt; mentioned and those of us at Comsec always take the lead role as the
&gt; "narks," but we were far from alone.  MOD managed to alienate the vast
&gt; majority of the computer underground, and people reacted.
&gt; 
&gt; All in all, both in this piece, and in the book itself, "MOD, The Gang
&gt; That Ruled Cyberspace," Quittner has managed to paint a far too
&gt; apologetic piece about a group of people who cared so very little
&gt; about the networks they played in and the people who live there.  In
&gt; the last 15 years that I've been skulking around online, people in the
&gt; community have always tended to treat each other and the computers
&gt; systems they voyeured with a great deal of care and respect.  MOD was
&gt; one of the first true examples of a groupthink exercise in hacker
&gt; sociopathy.  Selling long distance codes, selling credit card numbers,
&gt; destroying systems and harassing innocent people is not acceptable
&gt; behavior among ANY group, even the computer underground.
&gt; 
&gt; There have always been ego flares and group rivalries in the
&gt; underground, and there always will be.  The Legion of Doom itself was
&gt; FOUNDED because of a spat between its founder (Lex Luthor) and members
&gt; of a group called The Knights of Shadow.  These rivalries keep things
&gt; interesting, and keep the community moving forward, always seeking the
&gt; newest bit of information in a series of healthy one-upsmanship.  MOD
&gt; was different.  They took things too far against everyone, not just
&gt; against two people in Texas.
&gt; 
&gt; I certainly don't condemn everyone in the group.  I don't even know a
&gt; number of them (electronically or otherwise.)  I honestly believe that
&gt; Mark Abene (Phiber) and Paul Stira (Scorpion) got royally screwed
&gt; while the group's two biggest criminals, Julio Fernandez (Outlaw) and
&gt; Allen Wilson (Wing), rolled over on everyone else and walked away free
&gt; and clear.  This is repulsive when you find out that Win in particular
&gt; has gone on to be implicated in more damage to the Internet (as Posse
&gt; and ILF) than anyone in the history of the computing.  This I find
&gt; truly disgusting, and hope that the Secret Service are proud of
&gt; themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine if I wrote a piece about the terrible treatment of a poor
&gt; prisoner in Wisconsin who was bludgeoned to death by other inmates
&gt; while guards looked away.  Imagine if I tried to explain the fact that
&gt; poor Jeff Dahmer was provoked to murder and cannibalism by the mocking
&gt; of adolescent boys who teased and called him a faggot.  How would you
&gt; feel if I tried to convince you that we should look upon him with pity
&gt; and think of him as a misunderstood political prisoner?  You would
&gt; probably feel about how I do about Quittner's story.
&gt; 
&gt; 'Hacker' can just as easily be applied to "journalists" too, and with
&gt; this piece Quittner has joined the Hack Journalist Hall of Fame,
&gt; taking his place right next to Richard Sandza.
&gt; 
&gt; Quittner did get a few things right.  I do have a big cat named Spud,
&gt; I do work at a computer company and I do sell fantastic t-shirts.  Buy
&gt; some.
&gt; 
&gt; With Love,
