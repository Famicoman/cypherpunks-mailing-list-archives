January 27, 1995 1030 PST                                        Number F-09
_____________________________________________________________________________

PROBLEM:       The Unix /bin/mail utility contains security vulnerabilities.
PLATFORMS:     DEC OSF/1 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0
               DEC Ultrix 4.3, 4.3A, and 4.4
               SCO Unix System V/386 Release 3.2 OS Version 4.2
               SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
               SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0
               SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0
               SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
               Solbourne OS4.1x
               SunOS 4.x
DAMAGE:        Local users may gain privileged (root) access.
SOLUTION:      Apply appropriate vendor patch as described below.
_____________________________________________________________________________

VULNERABILITY  The vulnerabilities in the /bin/mail program have been openly
ASSESSMENT:    discussed in several Internet forums, and automated scripts
               exploiting the vulnerabilities have been widely distributed.
               These tools have been used in many recent attacks.  CIAC
               recommends sites install these patches as soon as possible.
_____________________________________________________________________________

          Critical Information about Unix /bin/mail Vulnerabilities

The /bin/mail utility on several Unix versions based on BSD 4.3 Unix contain
a security vulnerability.  The vulnerability is the result of race conditions
that exist during the delivery of messages to local users.  These race
conditions will allow intruders to create or modify files on the system,
resulting in privileged access to the system.

Below is a summary of systems known to be either vulnerable or not
vulnerable.  If your vendor's name is not listed, please contact the vendor
or CIAC for more information.

   Vendor or Source                   Status
   ----------------                   ------------
   Apple Computer, Inc.               Not vulnerable
   Berkeley SW Design, Inc. (BSDI)    Not vulnerable
   Cray Research, Inc.                Not vulnerable
   Data General Corp.                 Not vulnerable      
   Digital Equipment Corp.            Vulnerable
   FreeBSD                            Not vulnerable
   Harris                             Not vulnerable
   IBM                                Not vulnerable 
   NetBSD                             Not vulnerable
   NeXT, Inc.                         Not vulnerable 
   Pyramid                            Not vulnerable
   The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO)     Vulnerable
   Solbourne (Grumman)                Vulnerable
   Sun Microsystems, Inc.             SunOS 4.x vulnerable
                                      Solaris 2.x not vulnerable

Patch Information
-----------------

DEC          The /bin/mail patch is a part of a comprehensive Security
             Enhanced Kit that addresses other security problems as well.
             This kit was released on May 17, 1994 and was described in
             DEC Security Advisory #0505 and CIAC Notes 94-03.

             OSF/1 users should upgrade to a minimum of version 2.0 and
             install Security Enhanced Kit CSCPAT_4061 v1.0.  Ultrix users
             should upgrade to at least version 4.4 and install Security
             Enhanced Kit CSCPAT_4060 v1.0.

             Both kits are available from your Digital support channel or
             electronically by request via DSNlink.


SCO          Vulnerabilities in SCO's /bin/mail utility are removed by
             applying SCO's Support Level Supplement (SLS) uod392a. It is
             available via anonymous FTP from ftp.sco.com in the /SLS
             directory:

Sun          Sun has made patches available to remove vulnerabilities in
             /bin/mail.  These patches address all vulnerabilities CIAC has
             seen exploited to date, and CIAC recommends they be installed.
             However, the patches will be updated again in the near future
             to remove additional vulnerabilities that have recently come
             to light.  CIAC will announce the availability of the new
             patches when they are released.

             The patches may be obtained from your local Sun Answer Center
             or through anonymous FTP from sunsolve1.sun.com in the
             /pub/patches directory:

             SunOS    Filename         MD5 Checksum
             -------  ---------------  --------------------------------
             4.1.x    100224-13.tar.Z  90a507017a1a40c4622b3f1f00ce5d2d
             4.1.3U1  101436-08.tar.Z  0e64560edc61eb4b3da81a932e8b11e1
                 

Alternative Solution
--------------------

For those sites unable to obtain a vendor patch for a vulnerable version of
/bin/mail, a replacement package called mail.local has been developed and
made freely available on the Internet.  The /bin/mail program is relatively
complex software, serving both as a mail delivery agent and a user interface,
allowing users to send and read E-mail messages.  Complex system software,
like /bin/mail, is more likely to exhibit security vulnerabilities.

The mail.local package was written to perform only one task: the delivery
of mail to local users.  It is comparatively small, and the code has been
examined carefully by experts in the security community.  While it has not
been formally evaluated, it is probable that mail.local addresses all
vulnerabilities currently being exploited in /bin/mail.
