I stopped a Target department store and bought 7 Maxell URL 90 tapes.

As I am writing this note to you, I am both listening to the master copy
Hans Buehler sent me
on January 5, 1995.  

I will make a copy of the envelope I received the tape in.

  Best Mr. Bill Payne

  Yes, I am interresting of receiving the tape.
  I have toddy putted a printout of this email into an
  envelope with our company logo, and my bissnescard
  and sent it to your adress below.
 
  I must admit that I do not understand the purpose
  of want a postcard from me, but I guess that you have your
  reasons, and I have no problems to follow your instructions.
  So, the papermail is today sent to you.  If you prefer, I could also
  sent you a PGP-signed request for the broadcast.  Just let me know.

  It guess that it is the single missing reference that remains in order
have
  the whole story of Crypto AG documented.

  My intentions with the tape is to 
  1) make it publicy awalible on Internet, as sound, transcript in
Germany
  I will search for some fluid in German) and a translation to engish.

  2) I will contact Swiss Radio, in order to get as much as possible
verified about
  the tapes authentication.  I would also streangthens the tapes
authentication if I
  have your permission to mentioned that I received it from you.  Is
that OK? 

  &gt;Again, if you don't have     
  &gt; 
  &gt;broadcasts about the Buehler case that were on Swiss Radio 
  &gt; International on May 15, 1994 and     July 18, 1994.     
  &gt; send me a postcard at pob 14838, abq, nm 87191, usa.      
  &gt; I will make a copy and send.
  
  With best regards Laszlo baranyi 
  --- 
   
Let me respond

   I must admit that I do not understand the purpose
   of want a postcard from me, but I guess that you have your
   reasons,

I have not been reading e-mail since about 1 April 1997 when Patty and I
went to Zurich.

PRIMARY REASON is that the US government is a MASTER at messing with
minds.

Here is a reference

        ...  rise of acid fascism in America, including material    
       on Charles Manson, Mel Lyman, Victor Baranco, and their
followers    
       by David Felton    
    
seen at <A  HREF="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</A>.     

  "The Agency [CIA] is not an intelligence agency.  It is a         
  covert action agency whose role is to overthrow governments.         
  Disinformation is a major part of its covert action role.  The         
  American people are the primary target of its lies."         
         
  - Ralph McGehee, who worked for with the CIA for twenty-five
years         
         
  "Have we gone beyond the bounds of reasonable dishonesty/"         
  A CIA memo         
         
page 55  Wierd History 101  by  John Richard Stephens  
<A  HREF="http://www.adamsmedia.com/">http://www.adamsmedia.com/</A>         

So the idea is that if I do not read what the Great Satan wrote, then
the Great Satan cannot
mess with my mind.

Morales and I BOTH have some interesting stories of when the Great Satan
WAS SUCCESSFUL
messing with our minds.  Each incident cost us MONEY.

  1) make it publicy awalible on Internet, as sound, transcript in
Germany
  I will search for some fluid in German) and a translation to engish.

Suzy, who sent you the email in Hungarian, BY COINCIDENCE had a message
on our recorder
when I returned from Target with the blank tapes.

I told Suzy about your letter and enclosures.

Suzy is FLUENT IN GERMAN, she told me this morning.

The German translation problem may be solved.  

I am making a copy of the Swiss Radio International broadcast tape for
her at her request.

  2) I will contact Swiss Radio, in order to get as much as possible
verified about
  the tapes authentication.  I would also streangthens the tapes
authentication if I
  have your permission to mentioned that I received it from you.  Is
that OK? 

Absolutely.  

NOTHING IS SECURE ON INTERNET.

And as a result it SURE WORKS well for some applications where
visibility is CRITICAL.  I  attach
a message that went out this morning.  

I read at <A  HREF="http://www.aci.net/kalliste/">http://www.aci.net/kalliste/</A> this morning

      PESHAWAR: Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden for the first time on
Thursday denied his involvement
      in the August 7 bombings at the US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. 

      The 42-year-old Bin Laden contacted this correspondent on
satellite phone at 9:00 pm on Thursday to
      convey his statement through another Islamic leader Dr Ayman
Al-Zawahiri, head of Egyptian Islamic
      Jehad organisation which was held responsible for the murder of
Egypt's president Anwar Sadaat. 

      Following is Bin Laden's message: "Osama Bin Laden calls on the
Ummah to continue Jehad against
      Jews and Americans to liberate their holy places. In the meantime,
he denies any involvement in the
      Nairobi and Dar es Salaam bombings."  ...

      The News International Pakistan, August 21, 1998

US president Bill Clinton claims that Osama Bin Laden WAS INVOLVED.

We all have to decide WHO WE BELIEVE:  Bill Clinton or Osama Bin Laden.

      Barely 45 minutes after Dr Al-Zawahiri's telephonic conversation
with this correspondent, the
      Americans struck and reportedly hit both Khost, where he had held
his press conference in May this
      year, and Jalalabad, where he first took refuge after arriving
from Sudan in May 1996. 

NBC reported this morning that as many as 100 cruise missiles were fired
yesterday. <A  HREF="http://www.cdiss.org/devils.htm">http://www.cdiss.org/devils.htm</A>

---
10:47 AM  first tape finished.  I am making the second tape from the
first so as not to wear-out the
original Buehler sent me.
---

FIRING those cruise missile is SIMPLY GREAT for BUSINESS.  The military
can now write MORE
PURCHASE orders for NEW missiles.

What you are posting at your site is related to TERRORISM.

I accidentally stumbled into this mess at the time of the retaliatory
attack on Libya for the bombing of
the La Belle disco.

NSA employee Tom White told me that NSA regarded former president Ronald
Reagan as the US’s
greatest traitor.  Naturally, I had to learn more about why.

So perhaps you might think of tracing terrorist attacks starting with
the La Belle at your site.

My SPECULATION is that after what OUR LEADERS did yesterday you will
HAVE LOT OF MATERIAL to post.

             "Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat
it."    
                              -- George Santyana, 1905 

Thank you so much for the letter.  

And I hope you don’t mind my attempted EXACT transcription of the major
portion of your letter COMPLETE with English mistakes.  WE ALL MAKE
MISTAKES.

But intelligent people read-through or correct mistakes.  And move on to
the NEXT MISTAKE.

Several years ago I took a beginning course in Japanese.  Azusa Takegami
was the SWEET instructor.

For part of the final exam students had to GIVE A SPEECH IN JAPANESE.

Takegami and Hisako Yamada had the AUDACITY to videotape each student! 
Talk about embarrassment!

Patty and I were in Zurich last April.  I interviewed at IBM Zurich
forschungslabortorium.

Patty and I were IMPRESSED how well about EVERYONE is Switzerland spoke
English.

Most of the people at IBM are Germans.  

We asked how they learned to speak English so well.

They responded that ALL Germans are REQUIRED TO TAKE 12 years of English
in school!

For probably the same reasons Iranians have NO TROUBLE reading this.

America is adopting a new NATIONAL LANGUAGE.

Yo hablo y entiendo la idoma nacional nueva de los estado unidos.  Mas
or menos. 

NEAT to meet you on the Infobahn.  

I’ll get the package with the tape into the mail this afternoon.

Best
bill

We will be doing a Privacy Act violation/defamation lawsuit soon IF WE
don’t get this matter settled.

I lived in the basement apartment in the Luce’s home in Walla Walla in
1958-59 during my last year at Whitman college.

<A  HREF="http://www.mgovg.com/ethics/index.html">http://www.mgovg.com/ethics/index.html</A>

Charlie Jr was REAL SMALL THEN.

I might establish TWO-WAY e-mail contact with Charlie Jr.  

Looks like we might have ANOTHER "happy confluence of interests."       

I think my previous settlement offer

/\/\/\/\

Thursday 6/11/98 7:06 AM  
  
Robert Nordhaus  
Chief Counsel, DOE  
  
Monday May 22, 1994 I wrote  
  
Steve Dillingham, Senior Adjudicator  
Office of Contractor Employee Protection   
Department of Energy  
  
a settlement letter.  
  
  Here are initial non-negotiable portions of any   
  possible settlement agreement:  
  
     1    Back pay with interest from the day I was               
          fired,  
  
     2    Back benefits with interest from the day I              
          was fired,  
  
     3    Recovery of 401K losses, with interest, I and   
          my family  have suffered,  
  
  to the date settlement is complete.  
  
     4    Payment of my salary, with increments, and              
          benefits until I retire at age 65. ...  
  
  As a result of Sandia's and the US Government's   
  irresponsible and unintelligent actions from which I   
  was forced to defend,  I have almost no chance of   
  future employment in my profession or elsewhere.  
  
  Here is a list of my initial negotiable damage   
  payments. ...  
  
 4    Privacy Act violations regarding irrelevant         
      material  about my past employment taken from   
      my personnel security file were broadcast by   
      some Sandians.    
  
  Retired Sandia senior fellow Gustavus Simmons in   
  publications gave the impression that he was somehow   
  involved in my work on data authentication for the   
  seismic portion of the US/USSR Comprehensive Test Ban   
  Treaty (CTBT).  
  
  Simmons was not involved in seismic data authentication   
  work.    
  
  Funds obtained by Sandia for my successful National   
  Security Agency proposal on software voting were used   
  for other purposes.  
  
  My viewgraphs and papers on the CTBT data authenticator   
  were plagiarized by defendants Wright and Sellars for   
  their personal profit.   
  
     5    I feel that I was underpaid for my                      
           contributions to  Sandia and DOE.  A                           
           retroactive adjustment to my salary             
           should be negotiated.  
  
I spoke to my former PhD student Lewis last week.  
<A  HREF="http://www.friction-free-economy.com/">http://www.friction-free-economy.com/</A>  
  
Lewis advised in addition to the above point to ask for a minimum of 
$1,000,000 punitive damages.  
  
/\/\/\/\

is  TOO LOW.  

The meter is running, I am advised to continue to say.
<A  HREF="http://www.mhpcc.edu/general/john.html">http://www.mhpcc.edu/general/john.html</A>

Aletha L. Brown 
Inspector General
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
POB 18858
Washington, D.C. 20036-8858
202-663-4375
800-849-4230

Dear Inspector General Brown:

Purpose of this letter is to file  Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests.

JUL 15, 1998 I received the attached FOIA response letter from A Jacy Thurmond.

Thurmond's JUL 15 letter and attachments were included in an envelope postmarked WASHINGTON JUL 
23'98 DC.

Included in the envelope were two attached pages labeled COMMENTS.

Final paragraph of the COMMENTS two pages states

  You would have no claim under the Privacy Act for the disclosure of this charge file to the charging party.
  To maintain a suit for a violation of the Privacy Act's prohibition against disclosure, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b), a
   plaintiff must prove that the information disclosed is covered as a "record" contained within a "system of 
   records," as defined in 5 U.S.C §§ (sic)  552a(a) (4) and (5).  Davis v. Runyon, 142 F.3d 433 (6th Cir.   
  1998):     Quinn v Stone, 978 F2.d 126, 1`31 (3d Cir. 1992).  The Privacy Act defines a "system of records" 
  as  "a  group of any records under control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of 
  the  individual or by some identifying . . . particular . . . assigned to the individual."  5 U.S.C § 552(a)(a)(5).
  Our charge files are indexed by the name of the charging party.  They are not indexed, an no records are
  therefore retrievable, by the names of third parties mentioned in the charge file.  Under these circumstances,
  third parties mentioned in the charge file cannot invoke the Privacy Act's prohibition on disclosure with n    
  respect to that charge file because the file is not a record retrievable by the their party's name.  See
  Crumpton v United States, 843 F. Supp. 751, 756 (D.D.C. 1994).

Inspector General Brown,  the final paragraph in COMMENTS appears to be a legal opinion written by
some anonymous EEOC lawyer(s).

COMMENTS appears to be an ATTEMPT to convince me that I have no recourse to remedy under the law for 
release of the false and defaming documents seen at <A  HREF="http://www.jya.com/snlhit.htm">http://www.jya.com/snlhit.htm</A>.

Contrary opinion appears on Intenet at <A  HREF="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/FOIA/Foiaintro.htm">http://www.bxa.doc.gov/FOIA/Foiaintro.htm</A>

  Two district courts have gone even further. In Connelly v. Comptroller of the Currency, 673 F. Supp. 1419, 
  1424 (S.D. Tex. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, 876 F.2d 1209 (5th Cir. 1989), the court construed the broad 
  "any record" language contained in 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(C) to permit a damages action arising from an 
  allegedly inaccurate record that was not incorporated into a system of records. In a subsequent opinion, the 
  court in Connelly went on to find a cause of action under subsections (e)(5)and (g)(1)(C) with regard to 
  records not in a system.

Here are the FACTS surrounding the ATTACHED 11 pages beginning with Sandia National 
Laboratories   director  Michael Robles writing EEOC Director Charles Burtner. 
 
    A  I never saw the documents until Sandia employee Richard Gallegos gave me a copy in 1997.  
    B  Sandia denied that the documents existed.   
    C  The documents contain factually incorrect information.  I did NOTHING WRONG.  I followed all        
         Sandia procedures known to me and obtained all required Sandia approvals.
    D  I was never given an opportunity to defend myself.  <A  HREF="http://jya.com/greene.htm">http://jya.com/greene.htm</A>  
    E  Neither Sandia nor EEOC had my permission in writing for release  of the information.  

Ms Brown,  under 5 USC 552, the Freedom of Information Act, and 5 USC 552a, the Privacy Act, I request 
access to copies

1  All records, including phone conversation notes and memoranda, relating the creation of the COMMENTS 
document.

2  Name of the person or persons or any documents containing name(s) of person or persons which reveal who 
authored the COMMENTS document.

If all or any part of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption(s) which you think justifies your 
refusal to release the information and inform me of your agency's administrative appeal procedures available to 
me under the law.

I would appreciate your handling this request as quickly as possible, and I look forward to hearing from you 
within 20 working days, as the law stipulates

Sincerely,  
  
  
  
William H. Payne
