INVISIMAIL INTERNATIONAL LTD. ANNOUNCES  RPK InvisiMail™ ENTERPRISE EDITION

RPK InvisiMail Adds Strong and Fast Public Key Encryption Security to 
Internet E-Mail Products

SAN FRANCISCO, CA. August 18, 1998 — InvisiMail International, Ltd. (www.InvisiMail.com), announced today the release of RPK InvisiMail Enterprise Edition, a globally strong corporate e-mail security add-in.  RPK InvisiMail Enterprise Edition's flexible design allows corporate IT managers to configure e-mail security for individual users, networks and gateways.  RPK InvisiMail automatically and transparently encrypts e-mail messages and attachments, authenticates the sender and verifies that the contents have not been changed in transit. 

RPK InvisiMail integrates seamlessly with any Internet e-mail protocol-compliant product (SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4), to provide transparent, behind-the-scenes security that is easy to install and simple to use.  Unlike other e-mail security systems, InvisiMail operates through a local proxy service allowing it to be configured for a variety of environments.  Developed outside the U.S., RPK InvisiMail is the first e-mail security product with strong encryption, available worldwide and not subject to U.S. export restrictions.  RPK InvisiMail has been tested and certified by the International Computer Security Association (www.icsa.net).

 "Several of our clients have asked us to encrypt their e-mail communications.  We have not used encryption up to now because of the difficulty in finding a program that worked with all e-mail software packages and was highly secure.  We recently installed and tested InvisiMail's Enterprise Edition which is very effective and easy to install.  Most of the e-mail encryption packages we evaluated originated in the U.S. and because of export restrictions were barely secure.  We now recommend that clients who wish to work with us using encrypted e-mail obtain a copy of InvisiMail," said Martin Fenn, International Law Systems Journal.

"As a leading nationwide ISP with a fast growing market of home users and business customers, we are always looking at innovative tools to include in our Internet software suite to help the user. Security is a hot topic at the moment and we felt that InvisiMail provided a level of security that was second to none in addition to being appropriate for home and business users alike," said Victoria Rosethorn, Marketing Director, Prestel Online PLC.

RPK InvisiMail automatically integrates with client software including Netscape (Navigator or Communicator), Microsoft Internet Explorer (Internet Mail or Outlook Express), Microsoft Exchange or Outlook, Eudora (Light or Pro), Pegasus, Calypso, TurnPike, Parsons E-mail 2000 and Symantec ACT! 4.0.  InvisiMail also integrates with server software including Microsoft Exchange Server, Lotus Notes, Novell GroupWise, cc:mail and any other e-mail server with an SMTP compliant gateway.
