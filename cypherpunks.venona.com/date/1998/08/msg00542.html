Dear Internet Marketer,

Are you tired of endlessly posting your ad to online classified sites that
just don't get the job done? The fact is there are over 300 such sites
scattered about the Web and frankly none of them generate enough traffic
to be worth your while. Even when someone does visit one of these sites,
your ad is hopelessly lost in a myriad of similar offerings.

The true professionals of online marketing have known for some time that
nothing creates results the way a direct bulk email campaign does. We have
assembled a complete package on one CD-ROM that will enable to get your
message out to millions for surprisingly little cost and effort.

INTRODUCING...MILLIONS VOL. 1

We took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the 
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!  We
added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we combined them
all, we had in  excess of 100+ million addresses in one huge file. 

We then ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this huge list. 
It cut the file down to less than 25 million!!! Can you believe that? It
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public by
putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This created
many duplicate addresses. They also had many program
 "generated" email addresses like Compuserve, MCI, ANON's, etc. 
This causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables, and for  those 
that use Stealth programs, clogs up servers quickly with trash, etc. 

We then ran a program that contained 150+ keywords to remove 
addresses with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster,
 webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .edu,
mil, .org, .gov, etc.   After that list was run against the remaining
list, it  reduced it down to near 16 million addresses! 

So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all
others that are out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like
using the 100+ million that we started with, but a lot less money and a
lot less time!!  

Besides the 16 Million general email address we include over 400,000
TARGETED addresses of Business Opportunity Seekers, MLM'ers and
other Internet Marketers. These are people EAGER to hear about your
products and services. 
Other services charge upwards of 5 cents per address for this type of
list. We include it at no extra extra charge when you purchase Millions
Vol. 1

We also included a 5+ million "Remove/Flamer" file broken into seperate
files for ease of  extracting and adding to your own database of removes. 

To help you manage your email lists, you'll find a fully functional
evaluation copy of BulkMate 4.05 on your CD. BulkMate is an indispensible
tool for the serious bulk mailer. Among its 10 utilites are the ability to
filter any address list against a remove list, sort any list
alphabetically and automatically remove dupes, remove specific domains
from any list and count the number of addresses in each list.


 "You can buy from the REST or you can buy from the BEST.   Your choice.

What our clients are saying:

"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I
immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over the
course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I received
less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied with my
purchase!!  Thanks Syrynx!!"

product and received 185 orders!  

Ann Colby

"I am absolutely delighted! Your support is first rate. When I needed help
you were there for me. I got a real person on the phone. I've been
