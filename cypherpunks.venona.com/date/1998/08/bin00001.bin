agreement with QUALCOMM allowing it to create a Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) version for the company's RadioCamera wireless caller-location
system. The agreement stipulates, according to U.S. Wireless, that QUALCOMM
will supply the CDMA technology, technical assistance, and access to components
and equipment. Each company's technology will be cross-licensed, although
terms and conditions still need to be negotiated. U.S. Wireless will acquire
a commercial license for wireless location systems, while QUALCOMM will
gain a commercial license for integration within its CDMA infrastructure
products. Providing wireless caller location data that reinforces E-911
and other enhanced mobile services, the AMPS model of the RadioCamera will
provide geolocation data for the IS-95 CDMA standard and will be ready
for outdoor field trials by the end of the year. (<A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980813/u_s_wirele_1.html">YAHOO</A>)</FONT></TD>
