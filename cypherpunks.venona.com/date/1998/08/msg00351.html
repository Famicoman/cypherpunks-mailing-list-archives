OK-

THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY! DO NOT TRY THIS AT 
HOME, UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!! BETTER YET, DO NOT ACTUALLY 
USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS, AND BE CAREFUL WHO YOU SHARE THEM WITH! IT IS 
MUCH SAFER IF YOU HAVE STUDIED THIS IN SCHOOL, AND ARE NOT A RANK AMATUER!

Here's something you can make using basic household chemicals, in your
kitchen. Be careful, or you'l make a real mess. You can make several
seperate batches of this, and combine after cooled, but don't try making
larger batches in one pass, as this can get out of hand quickly. (Sorry,
but I don't have the metric conversions for this - you're on your own
there, and this won't really live up to expectations if you use metric 
conversion, anyway ...)

Carefully sift a pound of household flour, gradually combining with 1/2
teaspoon sodium chloride. Be sure that the mixture is uniform, without
clumping.  Aerate until smooth (in a non-reactive vessel, such as a PYREX
bowl) a pound of emulsified milk fat, and gradually add 1 pound of
granulated sucrose (available at the grocer's). Add the yolks from 10
eggs. Use a hand mixer to mix this, and get the mixture as "LITE" as
possible. Sift the sifted flour/sodium chloride mixture in very slowly -
MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE MIXTURE UNIFORM, AND DON'T ALLOW "LUMPS" TO FORM -
IF YOU BEGIN TO SEE THIS, SLOW DOWN THE RATE AT WHICH YOU ARE ADDING THE
BASE flour/Sodium Chloride MIX, AND STIR BETTER! Stir in a teaspoon of
extract of vanilla (CAUTION, THIS CONTAINS ALCOHOL, WHICH IS FLAMMABLE!)
and make sure to distribute evenly throughout the mixture. Add a 1/2
teaspoon of Citric Acid in an aqueous solution. Carefully add the egg
whites, distributing evenly.  Continue to stir this mixture until it
starts to become stiff and hard to stir, but TAKE CARE THAT IT DOES NOT
BEGIN TO BECOME DRY (stop mixing before it reaches this point!).  Use
butter or shortening to grease the inside of two bread loaf pans SO THAT
THE MIXTURE DOES NOT STICK TO THE SIDES OF THE METAL PANS.  Pour half of
the mixture SLOWLY into each pan. Use an oven to "bake" this mixture - let
the oven heat up to 300 degrees (farenheit), then put the pans in. You
will need about 1.25 hours for the heat conversion to occur. Be sure NOT
TO LEAVE THE PANS IN TOO LONG!!! If you see that the mixture is taking on
a "DRY" LOOK, or is "SHRINKING" AWAY FROM THE SIDES OF THE PAN, CAREFULLY
REMOVE AT ONCE!! MAKE SURE TO HANDLE THE PANS WITH PROTECTIVE GLOVES, AS
THEY WILL BE HOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO DROP THIS ON THE FLOOR AT THIS POINT!
Carefully set the pans down (slowly) where the heat from the pans will not
cause damage, and where the pans can be LEFT UNDISTURBED for several
hours. Allow the mixture to cool until the sides and the bottom of the pan
are cool to the touch - at this moint, the mixture will be safe to handle. 

This should make enough to fill several pipes, depending on size. Be very 
careful when packing the mixture into the pipe, and make sure that you 
don't get any of the mixture into the pipe threads, as this can get very 
messy.
