Hi-my name is Chris; I have been through this program 2 times already...  you
have no idea how profitable it is.  It is definitely the fastest thing
available.  We are talking' about thousands of dollars in 2 weeks time... send
it to as many as you can (even though it says 20...  trust me) I've-bought a
car, taken the kids to Florida (Disney), upgraded my CPU, and next on the list
is buying a nicer home...  GOOD LUCK...  you can't lose!

Don't JUDGE TOO quickly this might be the answer to all of your problems!

If you need to make a few thousand dollars REALLY FAST, then please take a
moment to read this simple program I am sharing with you.  No, it is NOT what
you think!  YOU DO NOT have to send $5.00 to five people to buy a report, buy
a recipe, or any other product.  Nor will you need to invest more money later
to get things going.  THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!
Complete it in ONE HOUR and you will never forget the day you first received
it.  If you are doing other programs, by all means stay with them, but do this
program as well if you CAN'T WAIT two to three months while you other programs
start to work for you.

The following is a plan to benefit you and your future.  To those interested
in at home minimal work to earn profits- this is a great option and much less
complicated than the average ad seen in classifieds for "email processor."

BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED...  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!  
******************************************************************************
********
Read the following and you will agree this is a very exciting opportunity.
Only invest a little bit of time and your reward could mean thousands of
dollars!  Good luck!

"IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!  With 2 hours of work I have made over US $11,000.00 in the
last three weeks... and my investment was just US$5.00!  I LOVE IT!  THANK YOU
11,000 X's!"
                      						-Julie M. St. Louis
________________________________________________________________      

  $$$ ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY? RIGHT NOW? $$$
 $$$ HOW DOES US$10,000 IN TWO (2) WEEKS (or less) SOUND? $$$
 
Don't laugh!  Try this for a change while you wait for the others to start
working.  One (1) hour of work to get started and NO MAILING LISTS!

Note: This is a service and is 100% legal (Refer to US Postal &amp; Lottery Laws,
Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code,
also in the Code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436,
which state that "a product or service must be exchanged 
for money received.")

                           --------This Is How It Works--------
 
Unlike many other programs, this three-level program is more realistic and
much, much faster.  Because it is so easy, the response rate for this program
is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST, and you will see results in two weeks or less!
Just in time for next month's bills!
 
You only mail out 20+ copies.  You should also send them to PEOPLE WHO SEND
YOU THEIR PROGRAMS because they know THESE PROGRAMS WORK and they are already
believers in the system!  Besides, this program is much, much FASTER and has a
HIGHER RESPONSE RATE.
 
Even if you are already in a program, STAY WITH IT, but do yourself a favor
and DO THIS ONE as well.  START RIGHT NOW!  It's simple and takes a very small
investment.  It will pay off long before other letters even begin to trickle
in!
 
                  Just give ONE person a US $5.00 gift.  That's all! 

Follow the simple instructions and in TWO WEEKS you will have US $10,000 in
your bank account! Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT
POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE. JUST ONE (1) US$5.00
BILL. THAT'S YOUR INVESTMENT!
 
                   +------+ Follow These Simple Instructions +------+
 
1. On a blank sheet of paper write "Please add me to your mailing list." Write
your name and address clearly and include your Email address (if  you have
one) for future mailings and courtesy follow-ups.  Fold it around a US $5 bill
and send this to the FIRST name on the list (#1).  Only the FIRST PERSON on
the list gets YOUR NAME AND A FIVE-DOLLAR GIFT.
 
Note: This is a service and is 100% legal (Refer to US Postal &amp; Lottery Laws,
Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code,
also in the Code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436,
which state that "a product or service must be exchanged 
for money received.")
 
2. Retype ONLY the list, REMOVING the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE LIST.  Move the
other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD (#3) position.
 
3. Send out 20+ copies of this letter.  Note: By sending this letter via
Email, the response time is much faster and you save the expense of envelopes,
stamps, and copying services.  Consider this, MILLIONS of 
people "surf the Internet" everyday, all day, all over the World! FIFTY
THOUSAND new people get on the Internet every month!  An excellent source of
names is the people who send you other programs, and the names listed on the
letter they send you.  Your contact source is UNLIMITED.  It boggles my mind
to think of all the possibilities!  Mail, or should I say Email, your letter
TODAY!  It's so easy, ONE HOUR of your time.  THAT'S IT!
 
To send your newsletter by Email:
 
 1. Go to "Edit" and "Select All"
 2. Go to "Edit" and "Copy"
 3. Start (compose) a new Email message
 4. Address your Recipients and Subject Blocks
 5. Click the Send Button
 
After you have pasted this article in your new Email, delete the old header
and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, Etc.).  Now you can edit the names and
addresses with ease.  I recommend deleting the top name, 
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply changing
the numbers.
 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.  When your name reaches the first position in a
few days, it will be your turn to collect your gifts.  The gifts will be sent
to you by 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself, who are 
willing to invest US$5.00 and one hour to receive US$10,000 in cash.  That's
all!  There will be a total of US$10,000 (or more) in US$5.00 bills in your
mailbox in two weeks.  US$10,000 for an hour's work!  I think it's WORTH IT,
don't you?
 
GO AHEAD...  TRY IT.  IT'S US$5.00!  EVEN IF YOU JUST MAKE 3 OR 4 THOUSAND,
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?  IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY!
 
                            --------TRUE STORY--------
 
    Cindy Allen writes: "I ran this gift summation four times last year.  The
first time I received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks and over
$10,000 in cash in the next three times I ran it.  I can't begin to 
tell you how great it feels not to have to worry about money anymore!  I thank
God for the day I received this letter!  It has truly changed my life!  Don t
be afraid to make gifts to strangers, they'll come back to 
you ten-fold.  So, let's keep it going and help each other in these "tough and
uncertain times."
 
Many of us just want to pay off our bills, buy a new car or buy a new home for
our family.  Whatever your reasons or needs are, this program worked for Cindy
and thousands of others (just like you and I) time and 
time again!  THIS PROGRAM CAN AND WILL WORK FOR YOU!
 
                            --------Can I Do It Again? --------
 
OF COURSE YOU CAN...This plan is structured for everyone to send only twenty
(20) letters each.  However, you are certainly not limited to twenty.  Mail
out as many as you can.  Every twenty letters you send has a return to you of
$10,000 or more.  If you can mail forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR
IT!  THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT, THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT!
 
Each time you run this program, just follow the steps (1) through (3) and
everyone on your gift list benefits!  Simple enough?  You bet it is!  Besides,
there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), no further trips to the
printer or copiers, and you can do it again and again with your regular groups
of gifters, or start up a new group.  Some people produce a mailing list of
opportunity seekers and send out 200 or more.  Why not?  It beats working!
Each time you receive a MLM offer in the mail, respond with THIS letter! Your
name will climb to the number one position at dizzying geometric rates.
 
Follow the simple instructions and above all, please "PLAY FAIR."
 
That's the key to this program's success.  Your name must run the "full gamut"
on the list to produce the end results.  "Sneaking" your name higher up on the
list WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it 
only cheats the other people who have worked hard and earned the right to be
there.  So please, play by the rules and the $$, $$$ will come to you!
 
           --------Mail Your Letters Out Today--------
 
 $$$ TOGETHER, WE WILL PROSPER $$$

Mail your US$5.00 "Gift" to the first name on the list ONLY.  Remove the first
name and move the other two up one place and put your name in the #3 position.
 
 GOOD LUCK!

 "I'm money conscious, but I also knew that I would just as easily spend $5.00
on junk food or something else that wouldn't amount to much.  You probably
don't believe this will work, but if you don't try it you will never know.
That's the way I felt. Try it.  You won't be sorry.  Best wishes in all your
ventures.
