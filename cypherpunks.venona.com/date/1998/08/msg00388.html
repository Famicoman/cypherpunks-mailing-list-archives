&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;OK-
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY! DO NOT TRY THIS AT 
&gt;&gt;HOME, UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!! BETTER YET, DO NOT ACTUALLY 
&gt;&gt;USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS, AND BE CAREFUL WHO YOU SHARE THEM WITH! IT IS 
&gt;&gt;MUCH SAFER IF YOU HAVE STUDIED THIS IN SCHOOL, AND ARE NOT A RANK AMATUER!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Here's something you can make using basic household chemicals, in your
&gt;&gt;kitchen. Be careful, or you'l make a real mess. You can make several
&gt;&gt;seperate batches of this, and combine after cooled, but don't try making
&gt;&gt;larger batches in one pass, as this can get out of hand quickly. (Sorry,
&gt;&gt;but I don't have the metric conversions for this - you're on your own
&gt;&gt;there, and this won't really live up to expectations if you use metric 
&gt;&gt;conversion, anyway ...)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Carefully sift a pound of household flour, gradually combining with 1/2
&gt;&gt;teaspoon sodium chloride. Be sure that the mixture is uniform, without
&gt;&gt;clumping.  Aerate until smooth (in a non-reactive vessel, such as a PYREX
&gt;&gt;bowl) a pound of emulsified milk fat, and gradually add 1 pound of
&gt;&gt;granulated sucrose (available at the grocer's). Add the yolks from 10
&gt;&gt;eggs. Use a hand mixer to mix this, and get the mixture as "LITE" as
&gt;&gt;possible. Sift the sifted flour/sodium chloride mixture in very slowly -
&gt;&gt;MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE MIXTURE UNIFORM, AND DON'T ALLOW "LUMPS" TO FORM -
&gt;&gt;IF YOU BEGIN TO SEE THIS, SLOW DOWN THE RATE AT WHICH YOU ARE ADDING THE
&gt;&gt;BASE flour/Sodium Chloride MIX, AND STIR BETTER! Stir in a teaspoon of
&gt;&gt;extract of vanilla (CAUTION, THIS CONTAINS ALCOHOL, WHICH IS FLAMMABLE!)
&gt;&gt;and make sure to distribute evenly throughout the mixture. Add a 1/2
&gt;&gt;teaspoon of Citric Acid in an aqueous solution. Carefully add the egg
&gt;&gt;whites, distributing evenly.  Continue to stir this mixture until it
&gt;&gt;starts to become stiff and hard to stir, but TAKE CARE THAT IT DOES NOT
&gt;&gt;BEGIN TO BECOME DRY (stop mixing before it reaches this point!).  Use
&gt;&gt;butter or shortening to grease the inside of two bread loaf pans SO THAT
&gt;&gt;THE MIXTURE DOES NOT STICK TO THE SIDES OF THE METAL PANS.  Pour half of
&gt;&gt;the mixture SLOWLY into each pan. Use an oven to "bake" this mixture - let
&gt;&gt;the oven heat up to 300 degrees (farenheit), then put the pans in. You
&gt;&gt;will need about 1.25 hours for the heat conversion to occur. Be sure NOT
&gt;&gt;TO LEAVE THE PANS IN TOO LONG!!! If you see that the mixture is taking on
&gt;&gt;a "DRY" LOOK, or is "SHRINKING" AWAY FROM THE SIDES OF THE PAN, CAREFULLY
&gt;&gt;REMOVE AT ONCE!! MAKE SURE TO HANDLE THE PANS WITH PROTECTIVE GLOVES, AS
&gt;&gt;THEY WILL BE HOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO DROP THIS ON THE FLOOR AT THIS POINT!
&gt;&gt;Carefully set the pans down (slowly) where the heat from the pans will not
&gt;&gt;cause damage, and where the pans can be LEFT UNDISTURBED for several
&gt;&gt;hours. Allow the mixture to cool until the sides and the bottom of the pan
&gt;&gt;are cool to the touch - at this moint, the mixture will be safe to handle. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This should make enough to fill several pipes, depending on size. Be very 
&gt;&gt;careful when packing the mixture into the pipe, and make sure that you 
&gt;&gt;don't get any of the mixture into the pipe threads, as this can get very 
&gt;&gt;messy. 
&gt;&gt;
