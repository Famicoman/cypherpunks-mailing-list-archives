Everybody Eats Food: and they will always buy GROCERIES! 


Greetings: 
I am sending you this only because Everybody, Everywhere can BENEFIT from this
program. I have received Bags of Testimonials STATING Everybody should Hear of this, 
so if you are Interested in Being Given $215.00 Please Read On. 

That is the bottom Line and one thing you can count on until the Earth stands still. 
If you had a chance to trade $25.00 for $240.00 would you do it, well that is what I 
am offering you today. 

This is how the program works, By using the certificates in the books, you receive 
grocery coupons of your choice, not chance, for products that you regularly purchase 
and use. The benefit to you is substantial savings on your grocery bills, due to 
having far more coupons for the products that you regularly purchase. 

We currently have an inventory in excess of 10 million coupons spanning over 1,200 
national, name-brand products. Product categories include: breakfast cereals and 
products, coffees and teas, frozen foods, paper products, laundry products,
household cleaners, personal care products, pet products, baby care products, and 
dozens of other categories of products purchased by thousands of people every day. 

What makes the program unique is that the Grocery Coupon Certificate Books allows 
you to choose coupons for the products that you already purchase and use. Instead of 
wasting time searching through the Sunday newspaper or magazines to find coupons, 
you simply fill in the product selections on the back of a grocery coupon 
certificate for coupons that you need. 

Then send the completed certificate to the warehouse and receive your grocery 
coupons within ten to fifteen working days. Each Grocery Coupon Certificate Book has 
a suggested retail price of $24.95 and contains twenty, ten-dollar grocery coupon 
certificates. In addition, each certificate book also contains four valuable Bonus 
Certificates. The certificates offer a phenomenal $240.00 in potential savings for a 
one-time, minimal investment.

However, if you take advantage of grocery stores that offer to double or even triple 
the face value of coupons on certain days, the potential savings from using the 
certificate books will be much greater. Because of this unique product, thousands of 
people across the country will have the freedom to choose the coupons they need and 
begin saving up to 50% or more off their grocery bills every time they shop.

"I urge anyone seeking a lucrative, ground-floor business opportunity to contact us 
immediately, so that they may take advantage of our incredible program and realize 
the fantastic savings and profits available to anyone who uses our Grocery Coupon 
Certificate Books."

It's easy to see why several top professionals in network marketing are saying that 
this is "by far the best MLM opportunity to surface in a very, very long time." For 
more information on purchasing a Grocery Coupon Certificate Book or becoming a 
distributor please call, Toll Free   1-888-512-6113, if busy or no answer. It is
