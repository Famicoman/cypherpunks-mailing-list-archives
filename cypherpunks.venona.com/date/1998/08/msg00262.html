attendance at the last Computer/Internet Expo or when you 
purchased the software from one our business affiliates.



I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE
And it will change your world soon...       
 
I receive a lot of telephone calls.  All of them interesting-some 
of them fascinating. Seldom though, do I receive a call that
I would truly refer to as "compelling." 

That is, of course, until my phone rang about 3 weeks ago. 
I still can't believe it. Odd call. 
Gentleman wanted some information-specific information.
Of course I had a few questions that I needed answered first.

"What's the product?"
"Can't tell you," came a rather hollow reply.
"Can't tell me? Why not?"  I pressed, becoming increasingly 
more curious-and irritated-by the moment.
Seeming to change the subject he said, "We want you to come 
take a look, and give us your opinion."
"Come where? And give you my opinion on what?"
"We'll send you a plane ticket."

Three days later, I found myself staring out the window 
of that early morning Delta flight as we made our final approach, 
wondering what in the world I have got myself into.

Met with the founders and the young man who had 
invented the technology. I guess it was about 
55 minutes into the presentation that I 
understood what these guys were up to,
and the profound effect this was going to have
upon the world-our world.  

While I sat there riveted on the CEO's every word, 
transfixed by the passion emanating from his steel blue eyes, 
I felt like some character in a spy novel, 
conspiring on a plot to overthrow the government.  
One day, I'll tell you the whole story.      

What you ask could have such a profound effect upon our world?


THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE TELE-COMMUNICATION INDUSTRY
AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS!!

I've recently been invited to the high technology company 
discussed above. It is a new publicly traded company.
It will be the Microsoft of the telephone industry. 
It is extremely well funded and has patented high technology.

The proprietary technology is the most significant advance 
in over 100 years of tele-communications. 
Protected by 2 patents covering 48 applications,
we have a private network infrastructure at a pre-opening 
investment of approximately 23 million dollars. 
We are not re-sellers of Long Distance time; rather a 
direct competitor to AT&amp;T and  others.

To illustrate the potential of this proprietary technology: 
the internal cost of AT&amp;T to complete a call is calculated
at approximately 3 cents per minute; 
MCI and Sprint the second and third largest competitor based on 
cost of approximately 4 cents per minute.  
Our private network "compression technology" can accomplish 
the same call for as little as 2/ 100th of a cent per minute.  

For example, AT&amp;T and MCI just announced they were going to 
cut their basic rates by 5% during the daytime and 15% during 
the nighttime. On a 15 minute coast to coast call AT&amp;T's 
new price will be $4.65 during the day for their 
average customer, our regular price to every customer 
every day (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) is $1.18.  
We can afford to beat AT&amp;T pricing because of our technology.  

But you ask, do I have to use any special equipment. 
Absolutely not.  Just pick up the phone and call the party
you want to reach. Pricing is only the tip of the iceberg 
with our new technology.  Our multimedia products are going 
to make your life so much easier. Star Trek is here, 
right now and our smart communications platform will bring it to 
you.  
AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint, look out there is a new major player in 
town.

We will only work with a limited number of individuals to launch
this company. If you think you have what it takes or have
proven that you do, do not wait a moment longer. This is a 
ground floor business opportunity, with a compensation package
potentially 300% more lucrative than our nearest competitors. 

Would you agree I have something here that spells opportunity? 
If yes, we need to talk further, immediately.
     
Call for information and cassette 1-800-741-6240
Please Leave your name and telephone number and the best time to 
reach you.

Removal Instructions...
It is in no way my intention to send anything to anyone 
who is not interested in the information; 
If you would like to receive future updates, 
simply called 1-800-741-6240
and indicate your name, address, and telephone number 
 Please complete all information.
If we do not hear from you, you will be automatically 
removed from future updates and will not be contacted again.
