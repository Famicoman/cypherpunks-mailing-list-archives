&gt;   The incredible shrinking Java alliance

&gt;
&gt;     A year ago there were four of them, members of a new alliance
&gt;   touting a potent new weapon designed to end Microsoft Corp.'s
&gt;   growing dominance in the computing industry.
&gt;     Now the Java Gang of Four is the Gang of Two and a Half.
&gt;     Java creator Sun Microsystems, Inc., of course, is still fully
&gt;   committed to the programming language, as is IBM. ...
&gt;
&gt; Not looking good for Java future.
&gt;
&gt; Java is similar to FORTH.  FORTH executes super-slow on high-level
&gt; in most machines.  About 10% of the speed of a compiled-language
&gt; program - such as Visual Basic.
&gt;
&gt; Specialized Forth and Java machine can be made to run fast.

&gt;
&gt; But I am not confident Java or Forth machines are going anywhere.
&gt; May be hard to get parts in the future.
&gt;
&gt; But I'm confident about the 80C32 supply!

&gt; Counterfeiting Wiegand Wire Access Credentials
&gt;
&gt;                                    Bill Payne
&gt;
&gt;                                  October 16,1996
&gt;
&gt;                                     Abstract
&gt;
&gt;                   Wiegand wire access credentials are easy and
&gt;                   inexpensive to counterfeit.
&gt;
&gt;         Access Control &amp; Security Systems Integration magazine, October
&gt;         1996 [<A  HREF="http://www/securitysolutions.com">http://www/securitysolutions.com</A>] published the article,
&gt;
&gt;              Wiegand technology stands the test of time
&gt;
&gt;              by PAUL J. BODELL, page 12
&gt;
&gt;              Many card and reader manufacturers offer Wiegand (pronounced
&gt;              wee-gand) output.  However, only three companies in the
&gt;              world make Wiegand readers.  Sensor Engineering of Hamden
&gt;              Conn., holds the patent for Wiegand, and Sensor has licensed
&gt;              Cardkey of Simi Valley, Calif., and Doduco of Pforzheim,
&gt;              Germany, to manufacture Wiegand cards and readers. ...  A
&gt;              Wiegand output reader is not the same thing as a Wiegand
&gt;              reader,  and it is important to understand the differences.
&gt;
&gt;                 In brief, Wiegand reader use the Wiegand effect to
&gt;              translate card information around the patented Wiegand
&gt;              effect in which a segment of a specially treated wire
&gt;              generates an electronic pulse when subjected to a specific
&gt;              magnetic field.  If the pulse is generated when the wire is
&gt;              near a pick-up coil, the pulse can be detected by a circuit.
&gt;              Lining up several rows of wires and passing them by a cold
&gt;              would generate a series of pulses.  Lining up two rows of
&gt;              wires - calling on row "zero bits" and the other "one bits"
&gt;              - and passing them by two different coils would generate two
&gt;              series of pulses, or data bits.  These data bits can then be
&gt;              interpreted as binary data and used to control other
&gt;              devices.  If you seal the coils in a rugged housing with
&gt;              properly placed magnets, and LED and some simple circuitry,
&gt;              you have a Wiegand reader.  Carefully laminate the special
&gt;              wires in vinyl, and artwork, and hot-stamp a number on the
&gt;              vinyl, and you have a Wiegand card.
&gt;
&gt;              IN THE BEGINNING
&gt;
&gt;                Wiegand was first to introduce to the access control
&gt;              market in the late 1970s.  It was immediately successful
&gt;              because it filled the need for durable, secure card and
&gt;              reader technology.
&gt;                Embedded in the cards, Wiegand wires cannot be altered or
&gt;              duplicated. ...
&gt;
&gt;         Bodell's Last statement is incorrect.
&gt;
&gt;         Tasks for EASILY counterfeiting Wiegand wire cards are
&gt;
&gt;         1    Locate the wires inside the card to read the 0s and 1s.
&gt;
&gt;         2    Build an ACCEPTABLE copy of the card.
&gt;
&gt;         Bodell's clear explanation of the working of a Wiegand card can
&gt;         be visualized
&gt;
&gt;              zero row    |     |   |
&gt;
&gt;              one row        |          |
&gt;
&gt;              binary      0  1  0   0   1
&gt;              representation
&gt;
&gt;         Solutions to Task 1
&gt;
&gt;              A    X-ray the card
&gt;
&gt;              B    MAGNI VIEW FILM,  Mylar film reads magnetic fields ...
&gt;                   Edmunds Scientific Company, catalog 16N1, page
&gt;                   205, C33,447  $11.75
&gt;
&gt;         is placed over the top of the Wiegand card.
&gt;
&gt;         COW MAGNET,  Cow magnetics allow farmers to trap metal in the
&gt;         stomachs of their cows.  Edmunds, page 204, C31,101 $10.75
&gt;         is placed under the card.
&gt;
&gt;         Location of the wires is easily seen on the green film.
&gt;
&gt;         Mark the position of the wires with a pen.
&gt;
&gt;         Next chop the card vertically using a shear into about 80/1000s
&gt;         paper-match-sized strips.
&gt;
&gt;         Don't worry about cutting a wire or two.
&gt;
&gt;         Note that a 0 has the pen mark to the top.  A 1 has the pen mark
&gt;         at the bottom.
&gt;
&gt;         Take a business card and layout the "paper match"-like strips to
&gt;         counterfeit the card number desired.
&gt;
&gt;         Don't worry about spacing.  Wiegand output is self-clocking!
&gt;
&gt;         Tape the "paper-match - like" strips to the business card.
&gt;
&gt;         Only the FUNCTION of the card needs to be reproduced!
