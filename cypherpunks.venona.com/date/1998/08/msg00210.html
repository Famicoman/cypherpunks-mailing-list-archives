One of the changes I made this morning to 

  RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE MEMORANDUM BRIEFS 
  ADDRESSING JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES

was to include <A  HREF="http://www.qainfo.se/~lb/crypto_ag.htm">http://www.qainfo.se/~lb/crypto_ag.htm</A>

Your work is a major contribution to getting to story OUT THERE.

Morales will sign at about 07:30 this morning and I will mail at about
08:00.

Let's all hope for PEACEFUL settlement of this STUPID TRAGIC BLUNDER.

 MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE MEMORANDUM BRIEFS ADDRESSING 
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES  [MOTION] was served on August 3, 1998 by Jan E Mitchell [Mitchell], 
Assistant US Attorney by mail.  Exhibit A.

2 Mitchell writes

  The Defendant-Appellee, National Security Agency [1], moves this Court for an Order extending the time
  to and including twenty-one (21) days following the date Plaintiffs-Appellants file their memorandum brief
  in which to file it memorandum briefs discussing jurisdictional issue in the above-referenced appeals. ...

    3.  Defendant-Appellee is not seeking an appeal and therefore, will NOT seek a certification for   
  interlocutory appeal from the District Court's memorandum Opinion and Order entered April 30, 1998, nor
  will Defendant-Appellee seek an order explicitly adjudicating all remaining claims.

    4.  On July 22, 1998, Plaintiffs-Appellants were granted an extension until September 1, 1998 to respond to   
  the Court's show cause orders of June 30, 1998.

    5 .  Defendant-Appellee seeks an additional twenty-one (21) days from the date in which Plaintiff's-
  Appellants' memorandum must be served in which to serve the memorandum briefs.  According to the Show 
  Cause Order, if Appellants do not seek and obtain a certification for interlocutory appeal or a final dispositive 
  adjudication concerning appeal N. 9821257, the appeal may be dismissed, in which case a jurisdictional brief 
  would not be required as to that appeal.  Should Plaintiffs-Appellants seek and obtain a certification for 
  interlocutory appeal pertaining to No. 2157, in the interest of economy, Defendant-Appellant seeks to file the 
  two memorandum briefs on the two very related jurisdictional issues at one time.

    6.  Undersigned counsel for Defendant-Appellee has contacted Plaintiff-Appellant William H. Payne who   
  has concurred on his own behalf and own behalf for Plaintiff-Appellant Arthur R. Morales in granting of this   
  motion. ...

  Dear Ms Mitchell:

  Purpose of the fax is to 

  1  review points covered in our 8/3/98 14:18 phone conversation
  2  suggest settlement.

  You phoned me today.

  You told me that you planned to file a motion or response to the Tenth circuit's
  request Morales and my response to the jurisdictional issue on the 21st of August.

  I told you that this was premature on your part since we had moved for a second time
  for an extension of time.

  I told you also that this matter was now before congress.

  You appeared to indicate to me that you were in the process of adding both Morales and
  Minihan as named parties in this appeal.

  You asked me if it would be agreeable to us if you filed a response to the Tenth circuit
  21 days AFTER Morales and I filed our response to the Tenth circuit on the jurisdictional
  issue.

  I AGREED.

  I spoke to Morales on the phone shortly after our phone conversation.

  Arguing points of law before court clerks and judges who have outstanding criminal complaint
  affidavits for crimes COMMITTED IN WRITING against them would be unproductive on Morales and my 
  part.

  Therefore, we will proceed to resolve the criminal conduct on the part of judges and court clerks
  before we proceed further in this matter.

  We will do this at the Congressional level.

  Senate Judiciary Committe chairman Orrin Hatch, unfortunately, failed to properly process a valid
  complaint on New Mexico district court chief judge John Conway in 1995.  
  <A  HREF="http://www.jya.com/whp071598.htm">http://www.jya.com/whp071598.htm</A>

  Hatch's failure to properly respond in 1995, in large part, caused our current legal conflict with DIR NSA 
  Minihan.

  We foresee an unfortunate escalation of hostilities if this matter proceeds as it is.  

  We do not wish this.

  We seek settlement of the UNFORTUNATE matter at the earliest time.

  We ask your and Congressional help to settle this UNFORTUNATE matter before it gets WORSE.

  If I have made any essential material errors in reporting my impression of the contents of our conversation, 
  then I would appreciate you giving your impression of possible errors.  

  You can do this in the letter you said you would write to us.

  Sincerely,

    I have received Mr. Payne's FAX dated August 3, 1998 at 4:22.  I want to clarify a few points. ...

    As to the caption of the appeal, I have noted in the motion for extension of time which has been filed with  
  the Tenth Circuit that there was an additional Defendant numbed in the District Court case.  However, I am

5  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <A  HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/overview.htm">http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/overview.htm</A>  Rule 54(b) states

(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties.

  When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim,   
  or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment 
  as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is 
  no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such 
  determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates 
 fewer   than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the   
 action as to  any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any
  time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.

Interpretation of meaning of 54(b) is

  RULE 54(b) JUDGMENTS UPON MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR INVOLVING MULTIPLE PARTIES

  CORE CONCEPT
     A judgment entered as to less than all claims in a lawsuit, or as to less than all parties in a lawsuit,
  is not immediately appealable.  Instead, the appeal must generally await the entry of judgment as to all 
   remaining claims and parties.  However, the district court can make a judgment as to less than all claims or 
  parties "final", and thus immediately appeals, by expressly certifying that no just cause exists to delay the 
  appeal and by directing the entry of judgment.

  APPLICATIONS
     Prerequisites to Rule 54(b)

    There are three prerequisites for obtaining an immediately appealable judgment from the district court 
  entered as to less than all claims or parties.

  1:  Multiple Claims or Parties Fully Resolved:  To be eligible for immediate appeal under Rule 54(b), a   
  partial adjudication must either (a) finally resolve at least one claim or (b) finally resolve the rights and 
  liabilities of  at least one party.  A claim or a party's interest MUST be adjudicated to finality, such that there 
  is nothing more to do that claim or that party but await the conclusion of the remaining portion of the 
  litigation.  This limitation is a pivotal one.  Rule 54(b) does not alter the normal rules of appellate finality for 
  individuals claims, and no appeal may be taken from district court ruling or any particular claim until the 
  court finally resolves that claim.

  Multiple claims exist where each claim is factually separate and independent, or where each claim could be 
  enforced separately.

  2:  No just Cause for Delay:  The district court must state, in clear and unmistakable language, that there is  
  no just cause to delay the appeal of the adjudicated claim or the adjudicated right and liability of a party.  
  Whether "just cause" exists is a determination made on a case-by-case basis.  Certain criteria guide the 
  court's consideration:

  o  The relationship between adjudicated and unadjudicated claims;

  o  The possibility that the need for appellate review might be mooted by future developments in district court;

  o  The possibility that the district court might be obligated to consider the same issue on a later occasion;

  o  The presence (or absence) or a claim or counterclaim that could result in a set-off against the judgment 
  now sought to be made final and appealable; and

  o  Other factors, including delay, economic and solvency concerns, shortening of trial time, frivolity or 
  competing claims, and expense.

  3:  Entry of judgment:  In clear and unmistakable language, the district court must also direct that judgment   
  is entered as to that one claim or one party.

  Explanation by the District Court

    In its order entering a Rule 54(b) judgment, the district court must clearly explain why it has concluded that 
  an immediate appellate review of that order is advisable.

  Burden of Proof

    The moving party bears the burden of establishing that a partial judgment should be entered under Rule 
  54(b).

  Discretion of District Judge

    Whether to enter a judgment under Rule 54(b) is reserved to the sound discretion of the district judge.  Such    
  arguments are contrary to the historic federal policy against piecemeal appeals.  For this reason, Rule 54(b) 
  orders are not granted routinely or an accommodation to counsel.  Instead, the district court must carefully 
  balance the needs of the parties for an immediate appeal against the interests of efficient management of the 
  litigation.

   Motions for Rule 54(b) Judgments

    A party may file a motion with the court to certify under Rule 54(b), or the court may do so on its own 
  initiative.

  Effects of Rule 54(b) Judgments

    Once entered, the time for appeal on the judgment begins to run, and does post-judgment interest.

  Appealability of Denials for Rule 54(b) Requests

    Allowing immediate appellate review of "partial" final judgments is a practice that departs from the federal
  courts' traditional opposition to piecemeal appeals.  Rule 54(b), thus, represents an unusual exception to this 
  settled policy.  Predictably, the court reject immediate attempt to challenge denials of Rule 54(b) judgments   
  as premature and unappealable until a final ruling his entered on the merits.

   Federal Civil Rules Handbook  1996, Baicker-McKee, Janssen, Corr, West Publishing Company

6  Appellants-Plaintiffs assert that there is NO REASON to seek a Rule 54 (b) certification for the 

REASON THAT New Mexico district judge Santiago Campos [Campos] already issued such certification.

FACT 1   4 May 1998  Campos writes

  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that sua sponte, Defendant is DEEMED by the Court to be the NSA, 
  and not Lt. Gen. Kenneth A. Minihan. Future captions for this case should reflect this change.

  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Morales is GRANTED.

1: [A] claim or a party's interest MUST be adjudicated to finality ... has been satisfied.

FACT 2   2:  is satisfed.   [N]o just Cause for Delay:  

Dismissing Minihan and Morales have nothing to do with the remaining claims of whether AppelleeS-

DefendantS Minihan and NSA provide lawfully requested documents on

	1  Iran messages given to Iraq during the Iraq/Iran war. <A  HREF="http://www.aci.net/kalliste/speccoll.htm">http://www.aci.net/kalliste/speccoll.htm</A>

              2  Libyan message intercepted by the US
	3  deficient NSA cryptographic algorithms

FACT 3    3: In clear and unmistakable language, the district court must also direct that judgment   
                     is entered as to that one claim or one party.

  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that sua sponte, Defendant is DEEMED by the Court to be the NSA, 
  and not Lt. Gen. Kenneth A. Minihan. Future captions for this case should reflect this change.

  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Morales is GRANTED.

   <A  HREF="http://jya.com/whp043098.htm">http://jya.com/whp043098.htm</A> is QUITE CLEAR.

FACT 4   Motions for Rule 54(b) Judgments

    A party may file a motion with the court to certify under Rule 54(b), or the court may do so on its own 
    initiative.

Campos issues Rule 54(b) certification ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE.

     However, I shall await decision on the appeals before the Tenth circuit prior to setting a date for   
     presentment of the classified Declaration or before taking any further action in this case.

FACT 5  Therefore, no Rule 54(b) certification needs to be sought by Appellants-Plaintiffs.

7  Campos did not explicitly state in Campos's June 29, 1998 letter <A  HREF="http://jya.com/sec062998.htm">http://jya.com/sec062998.htm</A>

or in Campos' MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER <A  HREF="http://jya.com/whp043098.htm">http://jya.com/whp043098.htm</A> that a 

Rule 54(b) decision was issued.  Therefore, Appellants-Plaintiffs seek to clarify Campos intention

  Re: William H. Payne v. National Security Agency
  Civ. No. 97-0266 SC/DJS

  Dear Judge Campos,

  We assume that your statement

    However, I shall await decision on the appeals before the Tenth circuit prior to setting a date for   
    presentment of the classified Declaration or before taking any further action in this case.

 in your June 29, 1998 letter seen at <A  HREF="http://jya.com/sec062998.htm">http://jya.com/sec062998.htm</A> is a sua sponte Rule 54(b) certification
 for immediate appeal.

  If we are incorrect in our assumption, then we ask that you write us and explain why we would need to 
  wait to appeal.

  Clearly we have satisfied the three conditions required for immediate appeal which we are sure you are
  acquainted.  

  If not, however,  these conditions are included  in Federal Civil Rules Handbook  1996, Baicker-McKee,   
  Janssen, Corr, West Publishing Company

  Also, we would ask that you justify seeking permission for appeal from a judge who has issued a  
  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER when appellants have satisfied Rule 54(b) conditions if you   
  choose to respond negative.

  If we do not hear from you Monday August 31, 1998, then we will treat our assumption as correct.

  Sincerely

         	WEED KILLER computer interface proposal section 7/27/98 10:11 AM

Solution to controlling and collecting data from the WEED KILLER involves interfacing a personal computer
running a version of the Windows operating system to the WEED KILLER analog/digital hardware.

Windows is not a real-time operating system, therefore  microcontroller controller/collector hardware 
interface must be installed between a Wintel PC and the WEED KILLER hardware.

Essence of the Wintel data collector problem is that Windows 3.x or 9x responds to a hardware interrupt
usually between 70 to 150 microseconds.  In rare occasions the interrupt latency may extend to 1.5 
milliseconds or even longer.  A microcontroller responds to an interrupt in several microseconds.

Wintel hardware controller interface is even more difficult than collection for the reason that the Windows 
operating system only gives control to an application when Windows decides.  In the collection, mode at
least a hardware interrupt signals Windows that the application wants control.  However, the microcontroller
can send the Wintel an interrupt asking the applications code whether there is any message it needs to
send the microcontroller.

Microcontrollers have specialized timers, serial expansion ports and are, therefore, designed to be interfaced to 
analog and digital hardware. 

An 80C32 family microcontroller is proposed for the WEED KILLER application for reasons.

1  The 80C32 will do the job.

2  Multiple vendors of 80C32 guarantee future supply at a competitive price.  Current suppliers include
 Intel, AMD, Winbond, Dallas, Philips, Siemens, OKI,  ATMEL, ... 

3  High-speed parallel port bi-directional IEEE 1284 enhanced capability port 9 (ecp) communications 
hardware between an 80C32 and PC is in the final stage of development.

4  IEEE 1284 hardware drivers are supplied with Windows NT.  Custom assembler dll drivers are available
for 9x and 3.x.

5  A public-domain Forth 8051 operating system hosting a high-level language and interactive assembler with 
complete source code documentation is available on Internet. <A  HREF="http://jya.com/f86/whpf86.htm">http://jya.com/f86/whpf86.htm</A>

Hardcover book further documenting 5 is available from Academic Press.

Only a Wintel machine is required for both hardware and software for the WEED KILLER project.  

Usually a Forth hardware/software development probject on requres a voltmeter, logic probe, and, 
infrequently, an oscilloscope.  Reason  is the INTERACTIVE control of the hardware and software
from a PC keyboard and diagnostic information easily printed to a PC monitor.

Justification for assertion made in the above paragraph comes from Internet.

NASA uses Forth extensively for its space programs. <A  HREF="http://groucho.gsfc.nasa.gov/forth/">http://groucho.gsfc.nasa.gov/forth/</A>

Ballard used polyForth <A  HREF="http://av.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=polyforth&amp;z=2&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0">http://av.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=polyforth&amp;z=2&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0</A>
to locate wrecks of the Titanic, Bismarck, and Yorktown.

Sun Microsystems workstation boot into Forth then invokes Solaris. <A  HREF="http://playground.sun.com/pub/1275/">http://playground.sun.com/pub/1275/</A>

Adobe Postscript is a version of Forth. 
<A  HREF="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/language/forth-postscript.html">http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/language/forth-postscript.html</A>

Video game software are written mostly in Forth.

The Wintel side of the WEED KILLER project will be most-likely written in a small
amount of assembler interface code and Visual Basic.

While Forth threaded code software technology is extremely valuable in some settings,
it is not in others.

Java is a variation of Forth.  <A  HREF="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/meyer/jvmref/">http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/meyer/jvmref/</A>

Future of Java on Wintel machines is unclear at this time.

For example,

  The hottest items among techies is a browser called Opera.   
  This is a $40 shareware program that in speed and compact   
  size buts both IE and Communicator to shame.  It has a slightly   
  different interface from either of the majors - an interface some find    
  refreshing while other find less than useful.  As it's shareware, you can   
  try and then buy if you like it.  One reason for its speed is that it ignores   
  Java - the Internet's Bandwidth Pig (IBP).   
 
  The Rumor Mill by Paul Cassel
  ComputerScene Magazine  July 1998   
   
Forth executes code High-level at about 10% the speed of a compiled high-level
language.

Speed of execution of small applications is not effected by Forth’s slow execution.

Reason is that initial code is written in high-level Forth.  

Inner loops are then translated into Forth assembler.

Speed is maintained with the advantage that data structures are created an maintained in
high-level language while the interactive operating system is retained for trouble shooting
both hardware and software problem.

Hardware cost of building the 80C32 the WEED KILLER boards is estimated at $10k.

Hardware design is estimated at 1 month labor at $50/hr for a total of $8k.

Software development on the 80C32 side in Forth and Forth assembler, software on the
Wintel side in Visual Basic and assembler, documentation, and training is estimated to
be 4 months for a total of $32k
