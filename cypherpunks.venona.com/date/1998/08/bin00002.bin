<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Developed by Snaptrack, the technology
will allow cellular phone users to transmit their locations to 911 emergency-system
operators. The system involves the employment of special software inside
the cellular handset that will permit a central office system to use global
positioning technology to detect the location of the caller. The trial,
influenced by the FCC mandate requiring wireless service carriers to provide
accurate 911 information by October 2001, is being run by the city of Denver,
Denver County, and Adams County, Colo. The product will be adopted by NTT,
Japan's telecommunication giant, which will install it in a wireless palm
computer set to be released in the second quarter of next year. AirTouch,
Ameritech, Bell Mobility, GTE, PrimeCo, Sprint PCS, and U S WEST are collectively
accessing the technology. (<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/08/biztech/articles/17cellular.html">NEW

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">According to market researcher Dataquest,
digital services' popularity continues to rise. According to the firm,
digital phone sales--which quadrupled last year to 5.6 million--will account
for half of all cellular phone sales this year. Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson
of Sweden was the top maker of digital handsets last year, with 41 percent
of the market share, followed by Nokia with 20 percent and QUALCOMM with
17 percent. However, some analysts expect Ericsson's market share to decrease
because it does not produce one of the three competing types of digital-cellular
phones. Nokia is the only company that makes all three, and Motorola has
plans to produce all three by the end of the year. Dataquest also says
that CDMA was the swiftest growing digital service last year, with approximately
one-third of digital cellular phones being CDMA as compared to three percent
in 1996. (<A HREF="http://interactive.wsj.com/edition/current/articles/SB903302451299742500.htm">WALL
