<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The cellular operators building antennas
in Massachusetts should be focused on the appearance of their communities,
according to a Boston Globe editorial. Operators can appeal any opposing
local decision on an antenna site under the Telecom Act of 1996, which
gives carriers the edge over communities, the Globe says. In February,
the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy gave telcos
the same protection as public service corporations, allowing them to surpass
local zoning. Because wireless service is not a requirement, communities
should be able to control the deployment of towers, the Globe says. (<A HREF="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe/globehtml/239/Controlling_antenna_blight.shtml">BOSTON

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Construction by five cellular phone companies
of a $1 million recreation building for the West Bloomfield Township Parks
and Recreation Commission in exchange for a land-lease permit from the
parks panel to build 120-foot-towers at the township's Drake Road Sports
Park has been delayed. The director of parks and recreation says the holdup
is the result of pending negotiations with the cellular tower attorneys
over a lease for the towers and a construction agency agreement, which
would address such issues as what kind of insurance will be provided and
who will pay for damages. (<A HREF="http://www.freep.com/news/locoak/nupdate27.htm">DETROIT

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Leonid meteoroid storm, scheduled
to hit in 81 days, is expected to be the worst meteor storm in 32 years.
Although there is no risk to human life---the meteoroids will burn up in
the Earth's atmosphere--the storm could damage the estimated 500 satellites
orbiting the planet. The storm will send a 136,000-mile trail of sand and
debris, most of which will be smaller than width of a human hair but will
be moving at three times the speed of the average meteoroid. The sandblasting
could create an electric charge that could possibly impair the satellites'
electronics. (<A HREF="http://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB904194234549984000.htm">WALL

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A $3.50 roaming fee is charged on a monthly
basis anytime a phone is used outside the home service area, the columnist
writes.&nbsp; Other cell-phone companies can charge a similar fee every
day you use your phone in their area. It gets passed on through your company.
And, like other roaming fees, it gets assessed on incoming, as well as
outgoing, calls. (<A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/ctd357.htm">USA
