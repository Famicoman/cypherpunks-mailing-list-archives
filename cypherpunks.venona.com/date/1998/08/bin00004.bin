and on Consumer Reports Online, www.ConsumerReports.org, helps compute
which combination of cell phone and service costs less. The comprehensive
report on cellular phones and phone services also includes a look at: the
pros and cons of analog vs. digital handsets; a comparison of how Omnipoint,
Sprint, and Bell Atlantic performed in one metropolitan area; the new plans
such as AT &amp; T One Rate and prepaid cellular; and the cost of being
connected in the 15 largest U.S. wireless markets. (<A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980817/consumers__3.html">YAHOO</A>)

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Ericsson says its DI 27 is the world's
first snap-on wireless data/fax infrared modem. It eliminates the need
to connect a traditional PC modem card and telephone line to a phone jack,
or using a cable to connect a mobile phone to a modem card. Weighing less
than half an ounce and half the size of a matchbox, Ericsson says it is
also the smallest modem available.&nbsp; (<A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980817/ericsson_2.html">YAHOO</A>)</FONT></TD>

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Since its spin-off two years ago from
AT&amp;T, Lucent has been restricted by the terms of its separation from
the telecommunications giant to acquiring smaller companies. But starting
in October, Lucent will be able to use the "pooling of interests" method
of deal making, an accounting method that will allow for stock-swap takeovers,
which ultimately lower the cost of making acquisitions. Analysts almost
unanimously agree that Lucent's No. 1 takeover target will be Ascend Communications.

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">As more boaters rely on cellular phones
for their communication needs, an informal pole shows that many Toldeo,
Ohio area boaters choose VHF in an emergency situation, columnist Shirley
Levy writes.&nbsp; VHF has greater range--up to 50 miles, compared to 10
to 15 miles for cellular--provides clear, uninterrupted service, facilitates
position tracking, and is the best way to reach the right people immediately.

<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Traverse City, Mich.-based MPI Wireless
has submitted a request to city officials asking for the permission to
erect a 10-foot tower atop a water tower in Alma, Mich. The antenna on
the water tower is less likely to cause problems--such as interference
with other communication devices or 911 radio signals--than building a
new tower altogether, according to some city officials. The issue will
be addressed at the Tuesday, Aug. 25 panel meeting. MPI has suggested paying
$6,600 a year and establishing a 10-year contract. (<A HREF="http://sa.mlive.com/news/tower.htm">MICHIGAN
