<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Denver Treasurer's Office says that
next month it will impose a tax on long-distance companies such as AT&amp;T
Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and other carriers that serve Denver residential
and business customers. The monthly tax, which will equal $1.12 per Denver
customer, is expected to be passed on to consumers and businesses as an
itemized surcharge on monthly bills. Providers of wireless phone and paging
services in Denver also may have to pay, depending on how their network
technology operates. (<A HREF="http://www.denverpost.com/business/biz0812.htm">DENVER

Resellers Association said that it is unnecessary for every cell site in
the United States to be modified in order for wireless number portability
to work.&nbsp; The TRA plan calls for wireless number portability to be
phased-in with implementation in major markets first, and with secondary
and rural markets brought online more slowly but still within a reasonable
period of time. (<A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980811/dc_tra_por_1.html">YAHOO</A>)</FONT></TD>

technology choices, brand names and prices. "All the hype surrounding wireless

calls that don't get through, by poor sound quality and by calls that break
up in progress. Switching services often just means swapping one set of
problems for another," the columnist writes. (<A HREF="http://interactive.wsj.com/edition/current/articles/SB902955459752849500.htm">WALL

much of the cost of the program.&nbsp; (<A HREF="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/wr/story.html?s=v/nm/19980813/wr/subsidies_1.html">YAHOO</A>)
