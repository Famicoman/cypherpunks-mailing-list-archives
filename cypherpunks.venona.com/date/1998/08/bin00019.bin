<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Nextel Communications has filed a lawsuit
in U.S. District Court against the White Oak, Pa., borough and its zoning
hearing board. Nextel's application for a 200-foot tower, which the company
wants to build on 100 acres of undeveloped land owned by a resident, was
rejected because of a borough ordinance that prohibits towers from being
built within 2,000 feet of an existing dwelling. A Nextel legal consultant
claims that the ordinance violates the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which
prohibits local jurisdictions from regulating telecommunications facilities.

vehicle's location, speed, and how much it has been driven. Roswell, Ga.-based
Roadtrac's Ceres Personal Tracking System employs satellite mapping technology
and a cell phone to monitor a car's location. Ceres, retailing at $650
in addition of a $100 installation fee, contacts the police if a car is
in an accident or is stolen; provides lost drivers with directions; and
with an optional $75 CD-ROM, lets users track their car via PC. Milford,
Pa.-based Ease Simulation markets the device, AutoWatch. Retailing for
$295, the system employs a car's diagnostic system to register engine functions.&nbsp;
