First, I'd like to tell you to REALLY read this and REALLY give it some thought 
before you say, "it doesn't work". It works. But you have to follow it and do 
everything just like it says. Read through this a couple of times to fully understand 
how it works.  Once you get the hang of it, it's easy.  If you need extra cash it's worth 
it.

READ ON.......................



 THIS REALLY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY



A little while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just like you are

now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make

thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of

$6.00! So I thought," Yeah, right, this must be a scam", but like most

of us, but I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send

$1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then

place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, and

post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No

catch, that was it. The main difference between this system and others

is that you have a mailing list of 6 instead of 5... This means that

your average gain will be app. 15 times higher!!!



So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought

about trying it. I figured what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and

$6.00, right?



Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the

legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office

(1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!



Then I invested the measly $6.00.............plus postage



Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail!

I was shocked! I still figured it would end soon, and didn't give it

another thought. But the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I

made about $20.00 to $30.00 dollars. By the end of the second week I had

made a total of over $1,000.00!!!!!! In the third week I had over

$10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have

made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly.......



It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I spent more than that on the

lottery!!



Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it

works....also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you

can get the information off of it as you need it. The process is very

simple and consists of 3 easy steps:



STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each

piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST" (include your name 
and address). Now get 6 US$1.00

bills (or equivalent in your local currency) and place ONE inside EACH

of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the

envelope to prevent thievery. Next, place one 

paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6

sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase,

your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating

a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!



Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses





#1 PM 

4855 E. Brown Rd #103

Mesa, Arizona, 85205



#2 D Richardson

4876 Princess Ann Rd # 118  
Box 319
Va Beach, Virginia, 23462



#3 CWright

5384 Liecester Ct

Va Beach, Virginia, 23462



#4 G. Fox

4 Amber Beach Rd

Marietta, NY 13110



#5 s cadwell
po box 5905
rochester,mn 55903


#6  M Evans

P.O. Box 30866

Phoenix, AZ  85036


STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the

other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as

number 6 on the list.




STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as

close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at

least 200 newsgroups. (I think there is close to 24,000 groups) All you

need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make!



Don't know HOW to post in the newsgroups? Well do exactly the following:



-----------------------------------------------------------

DIRECTIONS - HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS

-----------------------------------------------------------



Step 1. You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your

own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this

letter and click and hold down your mouse button. While

continuing to hold down the mouse button, drag your cursor to the

bottom of this document and over to just after the last

character, and release the mouse button. At this point the entire

letter should be highlighted. Then, from the 'edit' pull down

menu at the top of your screen select 'copy'. This will copy

the entire letter into the computers memory.



Step 2. Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the

top of the blank page. From the 'edit' pull down menu select

'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so

that you can add your name to the list. Remember to eliminate the

#1 position, move everyone up a spot (re-number everyone elses

positions), and add yourself in as #6.



Step 3. Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want

to do your postings in different sittings, you'll always have

this file to go back to.



----------------------------------------

FOR NETSCAPE USERS:

----------------------------------------



Step 4. Within the Netscape program, go to the pull-down window

entitled 'Window' select 'NetscapeNews'. Then from the pull down

menu 'Options', select 'Show all Newsgroups'. After a few moments

a list of all the newsgroups on your server will show up. Click

on any newsgroup you desire. From within this newsgroup, click on

the 'TO NEWS' button, which should be in the top left corner of

the newsgroups page. This will bring up a message box.



Step 5. Fill in the Subject. This will be the header that

everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a

particular group.



Step 6. Highlight the entire contents of your .txt file and copy

them using the same technique as before. Go back to the newsgroup

'TO NEWS' posting you are creating and paste the letter into the

body of your posting.



Step 7. Hit the 'Send' Button in the upper left corner. You're

done with your first one! Congratulations...



--------------------------------------------------

INTERNET EXPLORER USERS:

--------------------------------------------------



Step 4. Go to newsgroups and select 'Post an Article'.



Step 5. Fill in the subject.



Step 6. Same as #6 above



Step 7. Hit the 'Post' button.



-------------------------------------------



THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post

away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for

each newsgroup!



**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY 
YOU

WILL

MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**



That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within

day's! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount

of mail you receive. 

**MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**



Now the WHY part:



Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example).

So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the

5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each

with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5,

that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM

posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an

additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the

MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will
make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those

625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each

only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125

persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at

#1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive

$15,625,00! With a original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! And as I

said 5 responses is actually VERY LOW! Average is probable 20 to 30! So

lets put those figures at just 15 responses per person. Here is what you



will make:



at #6 $15.00



at #5 $225.00



at #4 $3,375.00



at #3 $50,625.00



at #2 $759,375.00



at #1 $11,390,625.00



When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest

posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the

list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The

thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all over

the world are joining the Internet and reading these articles everyday,

JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really

works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out

and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that

happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people

who are joining the Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to

give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000

to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the

actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will work.

You just have to be honest.



Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW, also. Try to keep a list

of everyone that sends you money and always keep an eye on the

newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS

THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic idea to make the

money!!



GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from

this, which is tons of extra CASH
