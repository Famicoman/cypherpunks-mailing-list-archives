Hi. If you received this letter by accident, there is no need to ask to be taken off the mailing list, as this letter will ONLY be sent to you ONCE.Thanks This is it folks.  This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.  Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major nightly news 
program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of 
the program described below , to see if it really can make people 
money.  If you saw it, you know that their conclusion was that 
while most people did not make the $50,000 discussed in the plan, 
everyone who followed the instructions was able to make 100 to 
200 times their money at the very least. The show also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings 
proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program.  This has helped to 
show people that this is a simple, harmless and fun way to make 
some extra money at home.  This is for real. I Actually Read a 
Piece of E-Mail &amp; I HAVE NOW QUIT MY JOB!
  
Hello, my name is Bubba and now I will have to change my profile 
to " Retired", as I quit my job of 5 yrs. as Asst. Mgr. in auto 
sales. As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use 
my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was 
this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time. About 
two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy 
subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I 
give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest 
$20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a 
little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after 
receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send 
out some e-mail advertisements for me. After reading the reports,
I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free!
     
I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six 
weeks, my P.O.box has been overflowing with $5 bills. I am 
stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in! I promise you, if 
you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to
eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and 
count your money!), you can make at least as much money as I did. 

You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you 
already are. If you can open an envelope, remove the money, and 
send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.

Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is. 
If I can do this, so can you!

                      GO FOR IT NOW!!    

PS: With the order of report # 1, I will send You some SIMPLE
instructions on how to follow the program effectively.           
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON. PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program 
you may ever see. Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven 
its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This program is 
showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line 
population desirous of additional income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does 
not require you to come in personal contact with people, do any 
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, 
except to get the mail and go to the bank!

This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply 
follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial 
dreams can come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, 
multi-level marketing program WORKS!

Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc.,
    -  Even retire!
This is your chance, so don't pass it up! 

---------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING 
PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do: We send thousands of people a 
product that they paid us $5.00 US for, that costs next to 
nothing to produce and e-mail back to them. As with all multi-
level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new 
partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. 
allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your 
computer).  We are not promising you anything.  You have to put 
forth some effort to make this business work, but come on how 
hard is emailing! The products in this program are a series of 
four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each 
order you receive is to include:
  * $5.00 cash United States Currency
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they 
    ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.
THAT'S IT! The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic 
multi-level marketing business anywhere! 

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND BE PREPARED TO REAP THE 
STAGGERING BENEFITS!   

       ******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell 
   them if you don't order them).
*  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE
   REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
   RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person 
   whose name appears on the list next to the report.
*  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 
   four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can 
   save them on your computer and resell them.
*  Within a few days you are to receive, via e-mail, each of the 
   four reports. Save them on your computer so they will be 
   accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will 
   order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are 
   listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in 
   any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" through 
   "d" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.Once 
   you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it 
   doesn't work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been 
   tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name 
        and address under REPORT #1 with your name and address, 
        moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.

    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down 
        to REPORT #3.

    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down 
        to REPORT #4.

    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed 
        from the list and has NO DOUBT collected large sums of 
        cash!

Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!
        
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
   and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the 
   instruction portion of this letter.

4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
   WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB can be very, very 
   inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to 
   advertise. Another avenue which you could use for advertising 
   is e-mail lists. You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 
   addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you.

     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them 
   the report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY 
   SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This will help guarantee that the 
   e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will 
   be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the 
   report!  To grow fast be prompt and courteous.

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it 
works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on 
your first level.  (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet 
will EASILY get a larger response.)  Also assume that everyone 
else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow
this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
        
1st level--your 10 members with 5 = $50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) = $500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000) = $5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000) = $50,000
THIS TOTALS -----------&gt;$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate 
only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would 
happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Lots of people get 
100s of participants!  THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely 
you can afford $20).  You obviously already have an internet 
connection and e-mail is FREE!!!

REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing 
and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors 
even work on trade! 
        
About 50,000 new people get online every month!

*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS********
TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow 
the directions accurately.
  
*  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them 
   when the orders start coming in because: When you receive a $5 
   order, you MUST send out the requested product/report to 
   comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title 8,Sections 
   1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code, 
   also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, 
   which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for 
   money received."

*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

*  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
   instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be 
   SUCCESSFUL!

*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******
Follow these guidelines to help assure your success: If you don't 
receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue
advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you 
should receive at least 50 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, 
continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 50 or 
more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is 
already working for you, and the cash can continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down 
on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You 
can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people 
are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income,
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again! 
There is no limit to the income you will generate from this 
business!

NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a 
business name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your 
local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal 
agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the

*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! 
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a 
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of 
potential income.  I'm living proof that it works. It really is a 
great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost 
to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program 
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.
                                 Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS    
 
I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to
you.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come 
in.  I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the 
plan was legal.  It definitely is!  IT WORKS!!!
                                  Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this 
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to 
get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached 
several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see 
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
                       Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up 
my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am, 
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there 
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get 
my money back.  Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size 
post office box crammed with orders!  For a while, it got so 
overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. 
I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life 
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter 
where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment with a faster return.
                                 Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

        
I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no 
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I 
was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I 
didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first 
try!!
                                    D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit 
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the 
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will 
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your 
family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck 
and happy spending!
                                Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA

You have great potential for extra earnings that is available at 
your finger-tips!  You have unlimited access to wealth, but you 
must be willing to take that first step!

ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO 
FINANCIAL FREEDOM!!!
