Read this it will change your life.

If you are not interested please excuse me for interrupting your 
day and 
just hit delete and I do apologize for any inconvenience.

This is a letter I received, many, many, many times, and just 
deleted, 
but finally I said to myself what the heck I'll give it a try. 
To my 
amazement DOLLAR BILLS just keep coming in everyday!  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Greetings

I am a retired attorney, and about two years ago a man came to 
me with a 
letter. The letter he brought me is basically the same as the 
letter in 
front of you now. He asked me to verify the fact that this 
letter was 
legal. I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it 
would 
be 100% legal.

When I first read the letter, I thought it was some off-the-wall 
idea to 
make money. I was curious about the letter, so I asked him to 
keep me 
updated as to his results. About two months later he called to 
tell me 
that he had received over $800,000 in cash! I didn't believe him 
so he 
asked me to try the plan and see for myself. I followed the 
instructions 
exactly and mailed out 200 letters. Sure enough, the money 
started 
coming! It came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was 
getting 
more than I could open in a day. I kept a precise record and 
after about 
three months my earnings were $868,439. I decided to try the 
letter 
again, but this time I sent 500 letters out. Well, three months 
later I 
had totaled $2,344,178.00!!! I just couldn't believe it. 

I met my old client for lunch to find out how this exactly 
works. He 
told me that there were a few similar letters going around. What 
made 
this one different is the fact that there are six names on the 
letter, 
not five like most others. That fact alone resulted in far more 
returns. 
The other factor was the advice I gave him in making sure the 
whole 
thing was perfectly legal, since no one wants to risk doing 
anything 
illegal. 

I bet by now you are curious about what little change I told him 
to 
make. To be legal, anyone sending a dollar must receive 
something in 
return. So when you send a dollar to each of the six names on 
the list, 
you must include a slip of paper saying, "Please put me on your 
mailing 
list" and include your name, mailing address, and email address. 
This is 
the key to the program! The item you will receive for a dollar 
you send 
to the six names below, is this letter and the right to earn 
thousands.

Follow the simple instructions below exactly, and in less than 
three 
months you could receive over $800,000.

A) Immediately send US $1 to each of the six people on the list 
below. 
Wrap the dollar in a note saying,"Please add me to your mailing 
list" 
and include your name, mailing address, and email address.

1) HEPALTA - 16406 - 117 Avenue, EDMONTON, Ab. Canada T5M3W2

1) Fred Ball - 1092 Adobe Canyon Rd., Kenwood, California 95452

2) G.W. Smith - 7082 Woolworth Rd., Shreveport, Louisiana 71129

3) T. Perdue 130 Dalzell St. Shreveport, Louisiana 71104

4) S.Hawryluk 5520 Bellechasse, Montreal,Quebec.Canada H1T-2B8

5) Raymond Lal, P. O. Box 1122. Regina. Sk.Canada, S4P 3B4

6) D. Dilley, P.O. Box 551, Wathena, KS  66090

B) Remove the name next to #1 on the list and move the rest of 
the names 
up one position. Then place your name in the #6 spot. This is 
best done 
by saving to a text file and editing it yourself and saving the 
new 
edited copy. Or type a new list and glue it over the old one.

C) You can mail your new letter out in two ways: 

    1) Through the U.S. Postal Service or 

    2) through e-mail. 

This letter has been proven perfectly legal for both ways as 
long as you 
follow the above instructions, because you're purchasing 
membership in 
an exclusive mailing list. To mail this out over the internet, 
you can 
browse through areas and find people to send this to all the 
time. All 
you have to do is cut and paste email Addresses wherever you are 
on the 
Internet. Remember, it doesn't cost anything to mail on the 
Internet. Or 
you can get a bulk email service to mail it out in large volumes 
for 
you. 

One that we recommend is:

Progressive Internet Communications Co specializing in targeted 
and bulk 
mailings (Very reasonable. Call for pricing.) (407) 956-1151 
P.O. Box 
100512, Palm Bay, FL. 32910-0512. 

If you are going to use the traditional U.S. Postal Service to 
do this 
program, you will want to order a minimum 200 names from a 
mailing list 
company. 

For the most effective for these lists are:

Advon Distributors ($28 / 200 names) P.O. Box B-11 Shelly, ID 
83274
(800) 992-3866. 

*Keep in mind- there is no limit to the amount of names you can 
send 
out. The more names you send, the more money you'll make. We 
strongly 
encourage you to mail this letter to family, friends and 
relatives as 
well.*

D) Be sure to send out at least 200. You should receive over 
$800,000.

E) Keep a copy of this letter and all the names you receive. 
Mail it Out 
again in about 6 months. But mail it to the addresses you 
received with 
each dollar. It will work again, only much better.

THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL !

(Refer to title 18, Section 1302 &amp; 1342 of the U.S. Postal and 
Lottery 
Laws). Assume for example you get a 7.5% return rate, which is 
very 
conservative. My first attempt was about 9.5% and my second time 
was 
over 11%.

1)When you mail out 200 letters, 15 people will send you $1
2)Those 15 mail out 200 letters, 225 people will send you $1
3)B29Those 225 mail out 200 letters, 3,375 people will send you 
$1
4)Those 3,375 mail out 200 letters, 50,625 people will send you 
$1
5)Those 50,625 mail out 200 letters, 759,375 people will send 
you $1
6)At this point your name drops off the list at earnings of 
$813,615.00!

It works every time, but how well depends on how many letters 
you send 
out. In the example above, you mailed out 200 letters, if you 
mailed out 
500 letters, you would have received $2,006,917!!

Check the math yourself, I want you to, but I guarantee it is 
correct! 
With this kind of return, you've got to try it. Try it once and 
you will 
do it again!!! Just make sure you send a dollar to each of the 
six names 
on the list with a note to be added to their mailing list. 
Together we 
will all prosper!!!!

PS You've read this far, so let me ask you one simple question:

Q. What do you have to lose??

A. Only $6

What you can gain is an income, like the example in this letter. 
Small Risk, Small Expense, 
HUGE Potential Return!!! 
What do you have to lose? 
I invite you to join our mailing list today!!!

THANK YOU AND I KNOW YOU WILL BE FINANCIALLY 
REWARDED.______________________________________________________
