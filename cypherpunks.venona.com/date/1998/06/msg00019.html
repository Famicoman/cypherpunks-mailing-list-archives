&gt; 
&gt; &gt;WOW.. A dual PII 266... then you will really be elite... because you
&gt; &gt;know.. if you have a fast machine, you don't ahve to know shit.. you can
&gt; &gt;just  fake it.. because your machine will cover up for you..... fuqin
&gt; &gt;moron...
&gt; 
&gt; First...I am not a hacker and don't pretend to be...I phreak a little and
&gt; like phones and shit...I subscribe to Telecom Digest and just like to
&gt; play with phones...I like to blow shit up for fun so you could say I am a
&gt; pyro...I got five bitches on my dick so you could call me a pimp...But I
&gt; never said I was a hacker...I just like to know about how shit
&gt; works...And in order to exploit any system, for fun or money or super
&gt; 3l33t props, you gots to know the system...I want to put linux on my
&gt; system because linux does have bugs and quirks and you have to know how
&gt; to do more than click a mouse button for the shit to work.
hah.. the fact that you are claiming that you are going to write a
"program" that will combine all the good /h/p/v/c apps out there and
combine them into one is simply ridiculous.. 
what you are claiming is that you are going to write a program that will
have builting crackers, sniffers, DoSes, Tone Generators, Virii creation
utils, box plans...etc. This is absolutely ridiculous...
just for the record, what would you consider the "good /h/p/v/c" apps out
there? the uberl33t winnuke.exe.. or perhaps maybe the k-rad linklooker..
it is ppl like you sho seriously make me wonder where society is headed...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;bwhahahhaha....if you can not detect the sarcasm in here, then damn, you
&gt; &gt;are a bigger idiot than I thought..... geez man..
&gt; 
&gt; Ya, sure...Sarcasm...You laugh at me but dude...William is to busy with
&gt; Netscape trying to dick him up the ass for me to call him again...
ok hippy.... why don't you sport your /&lt;-rad pvc pants and vinyl shirt and
talk smack about how you are the uberhacker....
I think you have seen Hackers the movie one to many times there acid
burn...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; And you know this...MAN!  I am wanting to write my own supper
&gt; program...I
&gt; &gt;&gt; want to take all the good h/p/v/c apps out there and make a nice point
&gt; &gt; &gt;and click interface for them all...one in linux and one in win (
&gt; ...fuck
&gt; &gt;&gt; the mac people... ) Put it all on a CD and send free copies to all the
&gt; &gt;&gt; cool hackers out there...Sort of a library O' chaos...Of coarse, I
&gt; would
&gt; &gt;&gt; not send one to just anyone...r00t would get a copy...I would send
&gt; Eric B
&gt; &gt;&gt; one just for kicks...Then I would send one to Death Vegi and the rest
&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the cDc...They got the cool philes....Anywhoo...Let me know who bill
&gt; is.
&gt; &gt;Good Yogi, and while your att it, stop world Hunger, Racism, and poverty
&gt; &gt;with your uberhacker program...
&gt; 
&gt; Again, you laugh at me for sarcasm....
hell ya I laugh at you... either you are too big of an idiot to reaalize
that you are being made fun of.. or you are to stupid to care.... at any
rate, kill yourself... you are breating air I might need someday....

&gt; 
&gt; But back to the real problem...yes, gcc would be ideal...How ever...I am
&gt; not running Linux as of yet...so do you or any of you know any OTHER
&gt; WINDOWS BASED COMPILERS that are worth a shit...I know it is a stretch
&gt; but god...
Not running linux as of yet? hehe so when are you gong to do a search for
linux.exe and start to run it?.. as soon as your superkool P2 266 gets
here... wowwie... I am impressed...... Hey DK.. pass me another beer...

&gt; 
&gt; And J-Dog, what is up with the fucked up lingo...This ain't the movies...
fucked up lingo? gee, I am very sorry if your small mind can not make out
my words.. but I can assure you that this is NOT fucked up lingo... go
read some h4x0r Br0s and then tell me about how fuct up my lingo is....
