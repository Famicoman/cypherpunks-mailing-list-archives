Subject: Jim Bell and anon

John: 

This is [a journalist] whom you called today about Bell. He was
arrested at his parents' home in Vancouver Monday about 1:07 a.m. PDT by five
federal marshals in two cars. The agents went in with guns drawn and came out
with Bell's elderly parents, with whom they talked for a while. A few minutes
later, they brought out Jim, who was handcuffed in front, dressed in a blue T-
shirt and slacks. He was put in the back of a red Jeep, and then leg chained
by an agent. (I tried to ask one of the agents if Jim was going to be taken
directly to Tacoma - my assumption - but the agent was a typical marshals
service jerk and just told me to stay away.)

Jim was in the backseat for about 20 minutes and then two agents came out and
drove him away - after one agent accidentally set off the Jeep "wa-wa" siren -
...just as TV arrived. the other three agents remained in the house, looking
for "evidence," i assume.

I expect him to appear before a federal magistrate in Tacoma tomorrow
morning. His federal defender still has not been provided any paper by the
govt.

so, now yr up to date.

on another matter, I was curious abt the anonymous info sent you. i've been
trying to get an anon remailer for some time, but have been unsuccessful. got
any tips, advice or help?
