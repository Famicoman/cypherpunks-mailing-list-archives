It is my humble opinion that possession of something physical that the
average person does not have the means to manufacture without
significant cost is very different from possession of something anyone
with high school math/CS skills can create from freely available books.

Now, if, next week, someone demonstrates a gun or some other physical
offensive weapon easily manufacturable using off the shelf parts at $10
a pop with less than $50 start-up costs (these numbers must include the
entire mechanism; in the case of a gun, it would include the bullets).

My objection to crypto regulations have nothing to do with rights; it
has to do with enforcement.  If you have almost no hope of enforcing
significant percentages of the violations of a crime law without posting
policemen at every PC and workstation, it would seem that the law is
pointless.  If the behavior is truly undesirable, then other means are
required to minimize the negative consequences of that behavior.

If you or anyone else really really want to follow up on this line of
discussion, please E-Mail me directly, and I will be happy to Cc: anyone
else expressing interest; I suspect I will not want to waste net
bandwidth debating this because it is largely theoretical.

	Same thing (gross lies) happens in the "freedom to own and keep
arms" context...

	Definition:  FACISM: n.:  a political and economic movement,
strongly nationalistic, magnifying the rights of the state as opposed to
those of the individual, in which industry, though remaining largely
under private ownership, and all administrative
	political units, are controlled by a strong central government.

	"One of the ordinary modes by which tyrants accomplish their
purpose, without resistance, is by disarming the people and making it an
offense to keep arms".  - Joseph Story, U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
	        -------------------------------------------------
	the German gun control laws were enacted by the "liberal" Weimar
Republic government that preceded Hitler, and were a strong aid to his
coming to power -- because they disarmed Hitler's opponents, and
Hitler's adherents ignored them -- as criminals have always ignored gun
control laws.

	Disarming the public is a frequent first step toward
dictatorships and genocides.  Once the disarming is complete, the public
is helpless against those who have the guns.
