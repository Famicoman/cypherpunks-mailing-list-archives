Lawyers

Morales and I met for lunch today to discuss legal strategies.

Morales is scheduled for a court hearing on Thursday.  Therefore,
it is time to increase the pressure.

These cases are not going away.

A fellow from Washington DC visited me some months ago.

The fellow told me that LOTS of people fighting with the IRS are
watching this pro se lawsuit seen at <A  HREF="http://www.jya.com/whp052898.htm">http://www.jya.com/whp052898.htm</A>.

Reason I was told is that the IRS is using lawyers to go after
taxpayers.

Taxpayers NOW feel that either they have to pay what the IRS DEMANDS OR
get a lawyer to fight the IRS.

Hiring a lawyer is usually uneconomical.  And an ineffective way to
fight the US
government.

Readers of jya.com want to learn how to do pro se lawsuits EFFECTIVELY.

Morales and I are, of course, showing how to do pro se lawsuits
effectively
and inexpensively.

Morales and I are experienced at WINNING appeals at the Tenth Circuit.

<A  HREF="http://jya.com/whp-10usca.htm">http://jya.com/whp-10usca.htm</A>

But we have yet to address the problem of Tenth Circuits awarding the
win to Sandia
when, in fact, Sandia lost on the common technicality of not filing its
Brief of the Appellees on time.

Sandia did not request an enlargement of time in both our cases.  In my
case Sandia falsified the certificate of service. 

Tenth Circuit rules forbid stamping FILED on late briefs where
permission to
file late is not requested at least five days prior to the deadline
date.

We will be getting around to filing criminal complaint affidavits on the
judges and clerks 
involved.  At the right time, of course.

But the time has come for Morales and I to file attached NOTICE OF
APPEALs.

We really should settle these unfortunate cases before matters get
WORSE.
