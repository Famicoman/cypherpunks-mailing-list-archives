To whom it may concern:

The text between [Start of translation] and [End of translation] lines below
is a verbatim translation of the two drafts of documents which are currently
in the state of approvement by the two Russian ministries: Federal Security
Service (FSB, one of the five special services inheriting to KGB) and State
Committee on Communications (Goskomsvyaz'). The originals (and comments) are
available at the Libertarium Webpages (www.ice.ru/libertarium/sorm).

Inconsistencies of the original texts (including but not restrictive to:
paragraph misnumbering, language vagueness etc.) are left intact. I left the
two Russian abbreviations: SORM for the System of effitient research measures,
and FSB for the Federal Security Service, to avoid confusion in future.

In short: if approved, the rules will provide exKGB with technical facility to
_directly_ and covertly wiretap _any_ information transmitted via
telecommunication networks including telephone, telegraph, Internet etc. and
there will be no means to ensure KGBists obtained a court warrant (required by
Constitution and other federal legislation) before wiretapping.

Any informed comments (of legal and technological, not emotional nature) from
both organisations and from individual experts are welcome.

I am grateful to all involved with obtaining the documents. Hope some day I
will be in a position to mention them by their names...

THE ORDER OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM OF THE EFFICIENT RESEARCH MEASURES
IN THE DOCUMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS 

First Deputy to the Director General 
of the Central Research Institute 
of the State Telecommunications of Russia 
Yu.A.Alekseev

"____"___________1998


Administrations of the telecommunications documental networks (DTC) including
the services of data transmission, telematic services, Internet informational
resources access services that are guided by the "Technical  Requirements To
The System Of Technical Means Providing For  The Fullfilment Of Effecient
Research Measures In The Documental Telecommunications" should conduct the
following technical and administrative operations. A plan of measures to be
taken in order to implement the system of efficient research measures (SORM)
in the network consisting of two stages (the first stage may be missing)
should be developed and coordinated with the Federal Security Service of the
Russian Federation. 

The first stage - implementation of limited functions SORM using standard
equipment of the telecommunications provider, experimental running of the
system and evaluation of its compliance with the main technical SORM
requirements. 

The second stage - full fledged SORM implementation considering the results of
the experimental exploitation. The first stage provides for: 

1. Development and coordination with the FSB of the technological scheme and
SORM functioning algorithms at the telecommunications operator's network based
on the technical requirements. 

2. Correction if necessary of SORM technical requirements considering the
results of the first stage implementation. 

3. Development of the list of SORM hardware and software used at the first
stage and according to the results of the first stage (stating type, cost,
supply conditions and payer for each item). 

4. Preparation of proposals and coordination with the FSB of Russia of the
necessary communication protocols for data exchange between SORM equipment and
standard equipment of the telecommunications provider if the provider complies
with the SORM technical requirements (stage 2). 

5. Purchase and delivery of the SORM equipment in accordance with the list
provided by p. 3 

6. Allocation of necessary technical means for checking and tuning of the SORM
software at the provider's equipment. 

8. Organization of the intercity communication line between
telecommunications operator and the DCC.

9. Preparation of the exploitation and technical documentation for the SORM
including the regulations for the duty services interaction. 10. Testing and
tuning of the SORM hardware and software during interaction with the
telecommunications operator standard equipment. 

The first stage is completed as the SORM acceptance report is signed and it is
accepted for experimental exploitation as the result of the joint tests (FSB
as the contractor and the telecommunications operator as the performer.)

The second stage provides for:

1. Development of the SORM requirements for the telecommunications operator
equipment based on the "Technical  Requirements To The System Of Technical
Means Providing For  The Fulfillment Of Efficient Research Measures In The
Documental Telecommunications" (adjusted if necessary according to the results
of the first stage) containing the list of: 

  hardware and software means providing for the implementation of the SORM
requirements and included into the equipment of the node (nodes) of DTC
network - HSM SORM NDTC; 

  hardware and software means providing for implementation of the SORM
requirements and included into the DCC equipment - HSM SORM DCC; 

  type of channel for communication between NDTC and HSM SORM DCC; 

  type of equipment for the communication channel between the HSM SORM NDTC
and HSM SORM DCC; 

  the data exchange velocity between the HSM SORM NDTC and HSM SORM DCC; 

  protocol of the data exchange in the communication channel between HSM SORM
NDTC and HSM SORM DCC; 

  protocol of junction between HSM SORM NDTC and HSM SORM DCC; 

  information security and privacy protection software for the SORM.
Telecommunications operator should coordinate technical requirements with the
FSB of Russia. 

2. The specification of the specific hardware and software that should be
included as part of the standard equipment of the telecommunications operator
and of the DCC (stating type, cost, supply conditions and payer for each item)
is compiled according to the technical requirements. The specification is
coordinated by the telecommunications operator with the FSB of Russia organs. 

3. Technical design development for the SORM implementation by the
telecommunications operator's enterprise is fulfilled by the organization
licensed for the fulfillment of design works by the order of the
telecommunications operator. 

4. Development of the SORM technical exploitation documentation  including
regulation for duty services interaction. 

5. SORM equipment assembling at the telecommunications operator's enterprise
is fulfilled by the organization licensed for the fulfillment of assembling
works by the order of the telecommunications operator. 

6. Testing and tuning of the SORM software at the telecommunications
operator's equipment. 

7. Conducting joint SORM tests (FSB of the Russian Federation as a contractor
and the telecommunications operator as a performer). The second stage is
concluded with the SORM industrial exploitation acceptance report which is
jointly approved by the telecommunications operator management and the FSB of
Russia representatives.
