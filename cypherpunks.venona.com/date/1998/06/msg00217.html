BloodSausage HogLog - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
___________________________________________________

"The lives of Frank, Gambino, Morel and Serafini ended on 
the gallows of Montreal's Bordeaux Jail on October 24,
1924. Valentino and Davis had their executions commuted
at the last minute."

"No one claimed Frank, Gambino and Valentino were among
the half-dozen gunmen who ambushed the bank car, but
prosecutorn R.L. Calder argued they were still guilty of
murder because of the organized nature of the crime."

~Excerpts from "Blood Brothers" by Peter Edwards.


  MeTheSheeple was glad to learn that these vile, criminal
scumbags, fingered by the person who had actually planned
and committed the crime, were held accountable for the
actions alleged to them by the gang-leader whose life was
spared in return for ratting out alleged coconspirators.
  I was particularly happy because I knew that the same
high standards of justice would undoubtedly be applied to
the criminal scum within the Canadian Justice System under
whose PigSkin Umbrella the Montreal Mobsters ruled the
streets and the citizens who walked them.

"Testimony at the Frank robbery trial showed that police
routinely sipped coffee with hoods and that Montreal's
finest had been tipped off to the armoured car hold-up
well in advance, but did nothing."

  Supreme Court of Canada Justice Louise Coderre (with a
left-handed frog-tongue over the first 'e') said, "Vice
has spread itself across the city with an ugliness that
seemed assured of impunity."

  Rather than bore you with all of the details behind the
criminal scumbag PigsWithBadgesAndGuns being also found
'GUILT OF MURDER BECAUSE OF THE ORGANIZED NATURE OF THE
CRIME', I will just skip ahead in the book and report on
the final outcome of &lt;trumpets blare&gt; JUSTICE &lt;flags fly&gt;
in the case of the police and city officials discovered
to have greased the wheels of organized crime in their
activities of drug dealing, robbery, murder, etc.
  Hmmm....nope...nada....maybe...nope...nope...

  Surprise, surprise! It seems that, following the
Coderre probe, "nothing happened that seriously
threatened the criminals' take. The name of Cadiex 
Street was changed to de Bullion Street after a New
ork play made the old name notorious, but along the 
same pavement the same crimes continued."

  Those without my cynical psychological make-up will
undoubtedly be able to supply you with reasons as to
just why the local citizens felt extremely 'served and
protected' when they came to after being mugged and saw
the new street signs, however, I will merely take a short
break, here, have a good dump, and wipe my butt with yet
another page of the Criminal Code of Canada.


And Silk Badges..?:

"I know who the real public enemies are. But they are
men who have the respect of the public; men who wear
silk hats, who are apparently of standing in the 
community."
~1930's Montreal MobBuster, J.J. Penverne
 (with no frog-licks in his name...)

  Peter Edwards provides the standard journalistic
explaination as to how "The term 'Mafia,' in its truest
form, refers only to organized crime in western Sicily."
and explains how it has been expanded to encompass any
pair of teenagers throwing a rock through a window, as
long as one of them has an Italian name.
  He neglects to explain, as some journalists do, that
the word "Mafia" is becoming increasingly generic, now
including the 'Lebanese Mafia', the 'Columbian Mafia',
etc.
  *All* journalists, however, seem unable to explain why
they continue to avoid naming the continuing organized forces
of armed domination over citizens of *all* ethnic groups the
'Government Mafia'...

  "Blood Brothers" is not the first book to point out that
at the heart of the "honoured society of Calabria" lies the
concept of "omerta" (with a right-handed strand of spaghetti
over the 'a').
  Nor is it the first book to fail to point out that omerta's
"double code of conduct that set different moral codes for 
dealings with those inside and outside one's family circle"
applies not only to Officially Recognized Criminal ScumBag
Organizations, but also to almost every 'gang' larger than
a Cult Of One from the PTA to the CIA to the USA. 
  'Omerta' decrees that when the president of the PTA molests
a child, when the head of the CIA commits treason, when the
president of the USA declares that US citizens will continue
to face imprisonment for exporting the same strength of
encryption that their government is sharing with Communist
China, that a street somewhere be renamed, while everything
else continues on pretty much as before.


  Don't hold your breath waiting for mainstream journalists
to upset the BadAppleCart by referring to the 'PTA Mafia' when 
they deem that your child should be forced to attend school with
a child who can murder them by biting them, while teaching
them that you are a dangerous psycho because of your gun
ownership; or to the 'FBI Mafia' when they murder a mother and
child in attempts to cover their previous unannounced, botched
armed assault on a citizen being charged with civil crimes in
an attempt to persuade him to invent crimes against his friends,
whether they were Jewish or not; or to the 'Government Mafia'
when they spend millions of dollars investigating and/or charging
Phil Zimmerman, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jim Bell, knowing that
the bottomless taxpayer pockets funding their legally unjustified
harassment will guarantee at least moderately successful results,
even if the end result is dropping the matter when the multi-
million dollar stench begins blowing back toward DC.
  Do not expect mainstream journalists to refer to the 'ASPCA
Mafia' when they release a hastily composed 'history' of 
TruthMongrel as a rabid, sharp-toothed, human baby conniseur,
after HeOrShe is cut down by FBI gunfire on Mayonaisse Mountain
during attempts to arrest the Author on 'Dog At Large' charges
filed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Bienfait, Sask.


Silk? We Don't Need No Stinking Silk...:
  The multi-facted PigsEar WebSites that are increasingly
being turned into InterNet Cult of One SilkPurses through
the increasingly efficient and powerful shareware digital
bread-slicers available to Jane and Joe Sheeple in their
quest to serve either God, Mammon, Dog or Mammy, according
to their prediliction, have the capacity, if uncensored 
and uncontrolled, of allowing the individual to rekindle
the creative spark of individuality that reminds them that
the word 'WE' should only be used by Kings, Priests, and
people with tapeworms.
  People with the ability to think for themselves; people
who know that if Timothy McVeigh was really the 'Muenster'
that the mainstream media claimed, then he would have been
in the 'Adams Family' movie; people who demand to know if
Monica Lewinski has a 'bent' pussy; people with conspiring
minds, who want to 'snow'; people who are not afraid to
stand up and cheer for the Officially Recognized BadGuys
on 'Cops' and 'World's Scariest Innocent Bystander
Threatening Police Chases'; people watching 'World's Dumbest
Criminals' who slap their forehead and say, "I hate it when
that happens..."
  People who read the Bienfait Nutly News.
