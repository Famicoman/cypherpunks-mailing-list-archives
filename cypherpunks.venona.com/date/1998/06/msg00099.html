<BR>
A telephone eavesdropping system was recently encountered which is being sold by a <BR>
company in Pomezia, Italy. The system is for use on AT&amp;T System 25, 75, and 85 PBX <BR>
systems (other versions are available for 1030, 3070, Merlin, and Partner systems).<BR>
<BR>
The first element of the system consists of a station card which has been built from <BR>
scratch and appears almost identical to the original cards built by AT&amp;T. There are <BR>
no modifications on the card, and all components appear legitimate<BR>
<BR>
The only visual difference between the cards is several additional integrated <BR>
circuits, and discrete components. Additionally, on the silkscreen side of the card <BR>
is a small logo consisting of an upper case letter E followed by a 7xx type of number <BR>
(such as E-728). The logo will appear diagonally across the card from the serial <BR>
number. Each station card will support 8 digital phones, and one outgoing circuit.<BR>
<BR>
The second element of the system is the printed circuit board that goes into the <BR>
actual telephone. Much like the station card the printed circuit board appears <BR>
original but closer inspection will reveal a small number of extra components and <BR>
PCB traces which go to the four pair position.<BR>
<BR>
Suspect telephones will present an anomaly on the power and/or 4th pair. The <BR>
signal is a digital data signal (usually 160 Kbps). Vector signal analysis will <BR>
indicate a QAM/BPQSK cats-eye (a digital audio signal via a seven stage parasitic <BR>
polynomial 1+x6+x7 algorithm). Waveform is a serial data stream, bipolar signal <BR>
at roughly 700mV (680-715 mV depending on instrument). Power drain is fairly high <BR>
(average of 136% over normal), but station card will not indicate an over-current <BR>
condition or station error. <BR>
<BR>
Serial data stream is constant, and only affected by application of power. Signal <BR>
stops if power is removed for more than 15 milliseconds. Disconnection of handset <BR>
does not effect signal. Signal is present in both on-hook and off-hook conditions.<BR>
<BR>
The third element of the system is a small modification to the PBX back plane which <BR>
consists of two small wires which are tacked into place between the station card and <BR>
the line card. This bridging circuit allows a T-Carrier signal to pass from the <BR>
station card to an unused cable pair for an outgoing signal path (usually the 25th <BR>
pair). This modification will appear to be a legitimate factory modification to the <BR>
backplane.<BR>
<BR>
The fourth element of the system is the transmission path back to the listening post <BR>
(which will appear to be a T-1 signal, but will only use one cable pair). A RF <BR>
transmitter could be used, however; such an emission would increase the possibility <BR>
of the system being detected if used inside or near the target facility. A RF <BR>
transmitter could be used once the signal is well outside the facility.<BR>
<BR>
The transmission path will normally consist of a T-Carrier signal that can be traced <BR>
to a facility demarcation point and then to an external cable pair. The signal will <BR>
typically terminate at (or just prior to) an off-site SLC box. At this point the <BR>
T-Carrier signal will be bridged back to a listening post either by hardwiring or <BR>
an RF transmitter (though the use of a bridging capacitor to isolate the DC <BR>
components of the circuit).<BR>
<BR>
Faked power outages in the PBX or server room will typically be used to cover the <BR>
installation activities. The installation consists of swapping the station card, <BR>
and then installing the jumper wires on the back plane. While the power is still <BR>
off the special printed circuit boards are installed into the target phones. <BR>
Optionally, the telephone may simply be swapped with an instrument that has been <BR>
modified in advance. Power is then restored with the event being logged as a short <BR>
power outage (usually during bad weather or construction work).<BR>

French Magistrate Targets Official Wiretapper<BR>
<BR>
PARIS, May 28 (Reuters) - A man who headed France's official wiretap<BR>
unit has been placed under investigation in connection with illegal<BR>
eavesdropping carried out on orders of the late President Francois<BR>
Mitterrand's office, judicial sources said on Thursday.<BR>
<BR>
Army Brigadier General Pierre Charroy, 63, was ordered placed under<BR>
investigation for complicity in invasion of privacy in his capacity as<BR>
head of the discreetly named Interministerial Control Group (GIC) under<BR>
Mitterrand, the sources said.<BR>
<BR>
The GIC is officially entrusted with carrying out wiretaps on the orders<BR>
of magistrates in cases of espionage or serious crimes. The body is so<BR>
shrouded with secrecy that it is not known if Charroy still heads it.<BR>
<BR>
Former Mitterrand aides acknowledged last year that the late president,<BR>
who ruled from 1981-1995, had ordered security officers attached to his<BR>
office to carry out illegal wiretaps on the telephone lines of lawyers,<BR>
journalists, politicians and at least one movie actress.<BR>
<BR>
The justice sources said magistrate Jean-Paul Vallat suspected Charroy<BR>
of having aided the presidential wiretappers who acted without the<BR>
permission of magistrates, making their actions illegal.<BR>
<BR>
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin pledged in last year's general election<BR>
campaign to end an era of "monarchical secrecy" if he came to power and<BR>
to lift the lid on cases like possible illegal wiretapping under<BR>
Mitterrand, with whom Jospin was on poor terms.<BR>
<BR>
Jospin has since been accused of dragging his feet on the promise since<BR>
he became prime minister and judge Vallat has written to ask for his<BR>
help in his probes.<BR>
<BR>
Some 15 former Mitterrand aides are under investigation and could face<BR>
possible trial in the case.<BR>
<BR>
Mitterrand died in 1996, seven months after leaving office.<BR>

Granite Island Group<BR>
Mission and Purpose Statement<BR>
<BR>
Granite Island Group provides expert technical, analytical and research<BR>
<BR>
capability for the detection, nullification, and isolation of eavesdropping <BR>
devices, technical surveillance penetrations, technical surveillance <BR>
hazards, and physical security weaknesses.<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Detection: Measures taken to detect technical surveillance devices, <BR>
technical security hazards, and physical security weaknesses that would<BR>
<BR>
permit the technical or physical penetration of a facility.<BR>
<BR>
Nullification: The process of neutralizing or negating technical devices <BR>
employed by making the placement of such devices more difficult. This <BR>
includes ensuring that a room is protected with adequate physical <BR>
construction and security measures thus making the placement or use of<BR>
<BR>
illegal listening devices ineffective.<BR>
<BR>
Isolation: A method to deter, or make extremely difficult, the <BR>
introduction of eavesdropping devices by establishing special security<BR>
<BR>
areas, for the conduct of classified or sensitive activities. <BR>
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Granite Island Group also provides:<BR>
<BR>
Vulnerability Analysis to provide senior management with guidelines for<BR>
<BR>
the enhancement of security and reduction of the vulnerability of <BR>
sensitive areas to the technical surveillance threat.<BR>
