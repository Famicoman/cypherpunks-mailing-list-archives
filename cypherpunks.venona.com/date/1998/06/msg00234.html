This came from Yahoo/ZDNet. Mr. Pappas suggests that we just ban anonymity
and privacy to "protect the children." Now where have I heard that before?
And yet again, the "Ethical Hackers Against Pedophilia" raise their heads,
no pun intended.

&gt;Banning privacy: A radical proposal 
&gt;
&gt;By Charles Pappas 
&gt;June 22, 1998 
&gt;Yahoo! Internet Life 
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Privacy and anonymity are our most cherished tenets of online life. A
&gt;need so immense that Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy
&gt;Information Center declared that we might need a kind of Department of
&gt;Privacy. He's not alone: 72 percent of surfers think there should be new
&gt;laws to protect their privacy. 
&gt;
&gt;It's a radical, 180-degree turn to take, but...what if we're all wrong?
&gt;What if this belief that privacy + anonymity = social good has become as
&gt;self-destructive and delusional as a drunk who thinks one more scotch
&gt;will make him feel better? 
&gt;
&gt;Like Marley's ghost, privacy may be coming back to haunt us. And that
&gt;ghost's name is pedophilia. How bad is it? Disguised as a 13-year-old, I
&gt;was directly propositioned on AOL in fewer than 10 minutes on each of
&gt;six separate attempts. I entered a chat room--usually called something
&gt;like "x9x10x11" or even "JonBenet Ramsey" (code words that alert
&gt;pedophiles where to swarm)--and waited for the assaults to start. 
&gt;
&gt;Even when I didn't enter a chat room, the offers kept coming in from
&gt;pedophiles prowling for victims. One wanted to send me pictures of
&gt;himself. Another asked for a phone number. "I want to do my daughter,"
&gt;one confessed to me. Later, when I searched for their screen names, they
&gt;had all disappeared into the anonymous electronic mist. 
&gt;
&gt;AOL monitors kids' chat rooms continuously. (Parents can also set the
&gt;AOL software so their children can't use chat rooms.) "We have a
&gt;zero-tolerance policy when it comes to anything illegal," assures AOL
&gt;spokeswoman Tricia Primrose. "We have about 8,000 monitors scanning up
&gt;to 19,000 chat rooms, message boards, member profiles, and other areas.
&gt;When we get any kind of complaint, we immediately check it out. And
&gt;we're working with the FBI, customs, and other officials." 
&gt;
&gt;It's not just AOL, of course. Child molesters "operate on every avenue
&gt;of the Net," says PhotonRain (not his real name) of Ethical Hackers
&gt;Against Pedophilia, a group that aids law enforcement in combating child
&gt;pornography. "WWW, newsgroups, IRC, ICQ, FTP servers..." 
&gt;
&gt;We already know it's widespread and easy to encounter. But how often
&gt;have we heard--and parroted--the party line that problems on the Net
&gt;just reflect real-world problems, no more and no less? Holland slays
&gt;that sacred lamb: "The amount of pedophilia on the Net is extremely
&gt;disproportional to...society as a whole. They hide behind the anonymity
&gt;the Net offers. And they are aware of the small odds against being
&gt;caught." 
&gt;
&gt;Ruben Rodriguez, director of the Exploited Child unit for the National
&gt;Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), concurs: "The Net is so
&gt;anonymous that molesters are very comfortable on it. They can go in and
&gt;hunt kids down, and attempt five or six seductions at the same time." 
&gt;
&gt;"Let's face it," says a New York State investigator who requests
&gt;anonymity, "the Net's anonymity enables the sickness. In a couple of
&gt;hours I could easily get 2,000 pictures if I wanted, including the Baby
&gt;Rape series," a popular collection of pedophilia photos whose name is
&gt;horrifyingly self-explanatory. 
&gt;
&gt;In recent weeks, U.S. authorities have helped nab 60 online molesters,
&gt;while the FBI reports that its 3-year-old Innocent Images
&gt;investigation--an online task force identifying predators--has resulted
&gt;in 184 convictions. An impressive stat, but less than confidence
&gt;inspiring when research suggests the average child molester will have
&gt;more than 70 victims throughout his lifetime. 
&gt;
&gt;At the same time we splash sex offenders' names online, our lawmakers
&gt;weigh in with proposed privacy law after privacy law. "No one wants to
&gt;give up privacy," says NCMEC's Rodriguez, whose organization now runs a
&gt;CyberTipline for leads on the sexual exploitation of children. "But what
&gt;do you do when your laws and protections are turned against you?
&gt;Something's got to give." 
&gt;
&gt;But what? Our conventional wisdom that privacy is worth any risks? Just
&gt;touching this petrified opinion will get me slapped with a swastika--but
&gt;as philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said, "All truth passes through three
&gt;stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third,
&gt;it is accepted as being self-evident." 
&gt;
&gt;To be continued--that's for certain.
