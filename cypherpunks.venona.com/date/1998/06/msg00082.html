Dear One Nation Supporter in NSW,

PLEASE READ THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MESSAGE and CIRCULATE WIDELY TO ALL YOU
CAN.

In the lead up to the Queensland State and Federal Elections there has been
growing hysteria in the media, major political parties and by minority
groups that "support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation is somehow bad for
Australia".

It should be of no surprise that One Nation has one goal in mind and that is
to bring equity in treatment back to ALL Australians irrespective of colour,
race, or creed. If you read the first sentence again you will see who is
going to 'lose' when divisive policies are removed by One Nation from the
Australian equation.

However, the most divisive force in Australia today is the mainstream media,
carefully controlled by men of enormous wealth who now seek the ultimate
prize, 'power over the politicians who run Australia'.

Many believe that they have already achieved this goal. Many believe that
the support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation  is a direct result of
'populist' Australians (that's you and me) seeing through the deals being
done between the major political parties and the media barons.

Today Australians face a real fight to retain their democratic rights in the
face of the media moguls. This is the 'real' media-hidden war that is being
raged right now with Pauline Hanson being the focus, the enemy. The coming
Queensland state and Federal elections are not over 'race' as the media
would have you believe, they are over our freedom of speech and democracy
which has already being largely destroyed through the concentration of our
media.

Last Tuesday Pauline Hanson raised the issue of 'The Draft Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples' in Parliament. 

What followed was the most disgraceful vilification by Howard, Beazley,
supported by the media, of Pauline Hanson, the messenger, while the message
- the potential impact of this treaty on all Australians - was totally ignored.

This vilification was epitomised by the live interview with Ray Martin on
Channel 9's 'A Current Affair' during which he changed the 'rules of
engagement' previously agreed to. The interview was supposed to be about
Pauline's speech in parliament and the ramifications of the UN draft agreement.

A range of links to documents related to Pauline Hanson's speech can be seen at:

<A  HREF="http://www.gwb.com.au/un.html">http://www.gwb.com.au/un.html</A>

Channel 9 have used these tactics before to secure an interview under
blatantly dishonest terms. Sixty Minutes approached Pauline Hanson to do a
'prime time' broadcast on 'a new political party in the making'... in 1997.
The original letter to David Ettridge confirming the 'rules of engagement'
with Pauline Hanson can be seen at this link:

<A  HREF="http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/onenation/letter.gif">http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/onenation/letter.gif</A>

In both Channel 9 interviews Pauline Hanson has appeared stunned, was
ridiculed by those interviewing her and thereafter denigrated by many of her
opponents. Quite simply she has been ambushed with unrelated questioning by
a less than ethical media doing the bidding of powers higher up.

This Sunday Channel 9's 'Sixty Minutes' has intimated that it will be doing
an 'expose' on Pauline Hanson's One Nation links to 'American influences'.
As of late yesterday they had refused to supply the source of their
information so that One Nation could respond. It will be an interesting time
for 'Sixty Minutes' to carry such a damaging, unsubstantiated programme,
less than a week before the Queensland state election.

The background to the programme to be run tomorrow can be seen at:
<A  HREF="http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/news/17029.asp">http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/news/17029.asp</A>

Here is a quote from that page:
'But as 60 Minutes has discovered, Pauline Hanson's one nation has little to
do with our nation. Much of her ideology is borrowed from loony extremists
in the United States, right down to her claim this week that the UN was
undermining Australia's sovereignty. Jeff McMullen reports that this fear of
a UN-led global world order is the central theme in the thinking of militia
groups at war with the US Government. And the militia leaders admit they
know and admire Pauline Hanson and have advised her supporters.'

With this in mind I would ask you to take this personal assurance from me. 

I have been privileged to get to know Pauline and understand the fire that
burns within her for Australia and her children, our future. She is not
influenced by anybody from overseas, her gun laws actually tighten gun
control through

"an instant record check to ensure those persons ineligible to own a firearm
can be quickly identified; we shall establish a register of persons
prohibited from firearm ownership. Prohibited persons: ie those convicted of
a violent offence."
 
See: <A  HREF="http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/press/guns.html">http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/press/guns.html</A>  

Pauline's aims are to work for the return of Australia to Australians - away
from the negative, direct influence of overseas-based multinationals; to
introduce Citizen Based Referendums; to allow you to have a real say in your
future (One Nation's policies can be seen at:
<A  HREF="http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/policy.html">http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/policy.html</A>) and to dismantle the power
blocks controlled by the media barons.

It is this last goal which is behind the vilification of Pauline Hanson by
the media and what she stands for, not the opinions expressed by those who
do their master's bidding.

You may like to tell 'Sixty Minutes' what you think of their programme, if
so use this link:
