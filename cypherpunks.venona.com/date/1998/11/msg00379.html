&gt; Explain how the system works. Explain how the various systems operate, how

&gt; examples.

Do you have any idea what you're asking for?

Quite frankly, I do not have the time (nor the space) to explain to you,
in detail, how an entire civilization operates.  In fact, any attempt by
me to explain such a system would fail, since there are doubtless many
innovations which specialists in the respective fields would make, and
there are many more which have already been made, which I am not
necessarilly aware of.

I have already offered you explainations of how some systems might
operate --the fire dept./insurance company situation, for example.  That
was in the sections you snipped for not answering "any questions that
have been posed".  I suggest you go back and read them, if you missed it
the first time.

I can, however, direct you to a book which deals with the subject in
some detail.  It's called "The Market for Liberty", by an author who's
name eludes me at the moment.  If you're really interested in the
answers to your above questions, I suggest you go read it.  If you need
the name of the author to find it, I'm sure I can look it up for you and
give it to you within a day or so.

&gt; We want an answer not some glib off the shoulder quip.

As I said, read the part of my previous post that you didn't bother to
address.

&gt; [I'm deleting the rest of this since it doesn't answer any questions that
&gt; have been posed to the anarcho-whatever side]
&gt; 

Then you haven't been reading very closely.
