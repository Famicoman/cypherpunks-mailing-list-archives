&gt; Subject: Re: A question about the new ISP ruling and email...

&gt; `(1) SERVICE PROVIDER- (A) As used in subsection (a), the term
&gt; `service provider' means an entity offering   the transmission,
&gt; routing, or providing of connections for digital online
&gt; communications, between or among points specified by a user, of
&gt; material of the user's choosing, without modification to the content
&gt; of the material as sent or received.
&gt; 
&gt;    `(B) As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the term
&gt; `service provider' means a provider of online services or network
&gt; access, or the operator of facilities therefor, and includes an entity
&gt; described in subparagraph (A).

That pretty much covers anyone other than a end-user/subscriber. This means
anonymous remailers, mailing list hosting services, email services, etc.

&gt; Subsection (a) deals with limiting ISP liability for transmitting
&gt; infringing material.  Other subsections deal with caching, hosting,
&gt; linking, taking down infringing material, liability for those who
&gt; knowingly misrepresent that material is infringing, and rights of
&gt; copyright owners to subpoena ISPs for identification information of
&gt; alleged infringers.  The requirement to register with the Copyright
&gt; Office and designate a contact person applies only as to liability for
&gt; hosted material.

Does 'hosted material' mean material that is put up by the ISP itself or
does it also include material made available by subscribers?

&gt; However, in order to be eligible for any of the
&gt; liability limitations, ISPs must meet the following conditions:

Ah, so there's more than simple registration...

&gt;   `(i) CONDITIONS FOR ELIGIBILITY-
&gt; 
&gt;           `(1) ACCOMMODATION OF TECHNOLOGY- The limitations on
&gt; liability established by this section shall apply to a service
&gt; provider only if the service provider--
&gt; 
&gt;        `(A) has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs
&gt; subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or
&gt; network of, a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate
&gt; circumstances of
&gt; subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or
&gt; network who are repeat infringers; and

Wait a second, I'm no cop. If somebody places copyrighted material on SSZ
for example I can see bringing suite against that party, but forcing me to
punish them by removing their account is over the line. Do I get restitution
for lost services from the copyright holder since I'm acting as their agent?

&gt;        `(B) accommodates and does not interfere with standard
&gt; technical measures.
&gt; 
&gt;           `(2) DEFINITION- As used in this subsection, the term
&gt; `standard technical measures' means technical measures that are used
&gt; by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works and--
&gt; 
&gt;      `(A) have been developed pursuant to a broad consensus of
&gt; copyright owners and service providers in an open, fair, voluntary,
&gt; multi-industry standards process;

So this is voluntary?

&gt;     `(B) are available to any person on reasonable and
&gt; nondiscriminatory terms; and

Meaning they themselves aren't copyrighted?

&gt;    `(C) do not impose substantial costs on service providers or
&gt; substantial burdens on their systems or
&gt; networks.   

Imposition of *any* cost is a substantial burden.
