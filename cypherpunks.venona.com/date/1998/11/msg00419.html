It is a Christian belief that life and immortality were brought to light,
and death, the last enemy, was destroyed by a personal Jesus only 2,000
years ago. The very same revelation had been accredited to Horus (a major
egyptian god), the anointed, at least 3,000 years before. Horus, as the
impersonal and ideal revealer, was the Messiah in the astronomical
mythology and the Son of God in the eschatology. The doctrine of
immortality is so ancient in Egypt that the "Book of Vivifying the Soul
Forever" was not only extant in the time of the First Dynasty but was then
so old that the true tradition of interpretation was at that time already
lost.

The Egyptian Horus, as revealer of immortality, was the ideal figure of the
ancient spritualists that the soul of man, or the Manes, persisted beyond
death and the dissolution of the present body.

The Origin and Evolution

We find, depicted on stones in many countries where the Stellar Cult people
migrated, remains of the old Astronomical religion which proves their
perfect knowledge of the revolutions of the Starry Vast and the Laws
governing these revolutions, all of which they imaged iconographically or
by Signs and Symbols. And where they have not built Pyramids they have
recorded the truth in the so-called "Cups and Rings" and "curious carvings"
found on boulders, cist-covers, on living rock, and on standing stones
throughout the British Isles, Europe, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the
world - which hitherto have been deemed to involve insoluble problems and
have been to all our learned professors an outstanding puzzle in
pre-historic research. But they are easily read, and the secrets are
unfolded in the Sign Language of the Astronomical, or Stellar Cult Religion
of the Ancient Egyptians.

The mutilation of Osiris in his coffin, the stripping of his corpse and
tearing it asunder by Set, who scattered it piecemeal, has its equivalent
by the stripping of the dead body of Jesus whilst it still hung upon the
Cross, and parting the garments amongst the spoilers. 

In St. John's account the crucifixion takes place at the time of the
Passover, and the victim of sacrifice in human form is substituted for, and
identified with, the Paschal Lamb. But, as this version further shows, the
death assigned is in keeping with that of the non-human victim. Not a bone
of the sufferer to be broken. This is supposed to be in fulfilment of
prophecy. It is said by the Psalmist (34:20): "He keepeth all His bones;
not one of them is broken". But this was in strict accordance with the
original law of Tabu. No matter what the type, from bear to lamb, no bone
of the sacrificial victim was ever permitted to be broken; and the only
change was in the substitution of the human type for the animal, which had
been made already when human Horus became the type of sacrifice instead of
the calf or lamb. When the Australian natives sacrificed their little bear,
not a bone of it was ever broken. When the Iroquois sacrificed the white
dog, not a bone was broken. This was a common custom, on account of the
resurrection as conceived by the primitive races, and the same is applied
to Osiris-Horus. Every bone of the skeleton was to remain intact as a basis
for the future building.

It is an utterance of the Truth that is eternal to say that Horus as the
Son of God had previously been all the Gospel Jesus is made to say his is,
or is to become:

Horus and the Father are one;

*Jesus says, "I and my Father are one". He that seeth Me, seeth Him that
sent me".
*Horus is the Father seen in the Son.
*Jesus claims to be the Son in whom the Father is revealed.

*Horus was the light of the world, the light that is represented by the
symbolical eye, the sign of salvation.
*Jesus is made to declare that He is the light of the world.

*Horus was the way, the truth, the life by name and in person.
*Jesus is made to assert that he is the way, the truth, and the life.

*Horus was the plant, the shoot, the natzar.
*Jesus is made to say: "I am the true vine".

*Horus says: "It is I who traverse the heaven; I go around the Sekhet-Arru
(the Elysian Fields); Eternity has been assigned to me without end. Lo! I
am heir of endless time and my attribute is eternity".
*Jesus says: "I am come down from Heaven. For this is the will of the
Father that everyone who beholdeth the Son and believeth in Him should have
eternal life, and I willl raise him up at the last day"
He, too, claims to be the lord of eternity.

*Horus says: "I open the Tuat that I may drive away the darkness"
*Jesus says: "I am come a light unto the world."

*Horus says: (I am equipped with thy words O Ra (the father in
heaven)(ch.32) and repeat them to those who are deprived of breath.
(ch.38). These were the words of the father in heaven.
*Jesus says: "The Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment,
what I should say and what I should speak. Whatsoever I speak, therefore,
even as the Father said unto me, so I speak the word which ye hear is not
mine, but the Father's which sent me".


   A comparative list of some pre-existing types to Christianity shows
further how these types were brought on in the canonical Gospels and the
Book of Revelation:

*Horus baptized with water by Anup = Jesus baptized with water by John.

*Aan, a name of the divine scribe = John the divine scribe.

*Horus born in Annu, the place of bread = Jesus born in Bethlehem, the
house of bread

*Horus the Good Shepherd with the crook upon his shoulders = Jesus the Good
Shepherd with the lamb or kid upon his shoulder

*The Seven on board the boat with Horus = The seven fishers on board the
boat with Jesus

*Horus as the Lamb = Jesus as the Lamb.

*Horus as the Lion = Jesus as the Lion

*Horus identified with the Tat or Cross = Jesus identified with the Cross

*Horus of twelve years = Jusus of twelve years

*Horus made a man of thirty years in his baptism = Jesus made a man of
thirty years in his baptism

*Horus the Krst = Jesus the Christ

*Horus the manifesting Son of God = Jesus the manifesting Son of God

* The trinity of Atum the Father, Horus the Son, and Ra the Holy Spirit =
The trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

*The first Horus as child of the Virgin, the second as Son of Ra = Jesus as
the Virgin's child, the Christ as Son of the Father.

*Horus the sower and Set the destroyer in the harvestfield = Jesus the
sower of the good seed and Satan the sower of tares.

*Horus carried of by Set to the summit of Mount Hetep = Jesus spirited away
by Satan into an exceedingly high mountain

*Set and Horus contending on the Mount = Jesus and Satan contending on the
Mount.

*Horus as Iu-em-Hetep, the child teacher in the temple = The child Jesus as
teacher in the Temple

* The mummy bandage that was woven without seam = The vesture of the Christ
without a seam.

*Twelve followers of Horus as Har-Khutti = Twelve followers of Jesus as the
twelve disciples.

In conclusion, GO AWAY.
