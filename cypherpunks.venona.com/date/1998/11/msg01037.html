BOOST YOUR WEB SITE'S TRAFFIC--GET LISTED ON YAHOO!


----------------

THE MARKETING BENEFITS OF HAVING A YAHOO! LISTING


FACT: Yahoo! is the most important search engine/directory 
on which your Web site can be listed.  

FACT: Independently conducted Internet studies show that 
42% of all Internet traffic and 70% of all business-to-
business Web site traffic is generated from Yahoo!.

FACT: Getting your Web site listed on Yahoo! is without 
question the single most important marketing step you can 
take to promote your Web site. 


EXAMPLE: For some of our clients, a Yahoo! listing is the 
only Internet advertising they have--and the only 
advertising they need. 

EXAMPLE: Some of our clients now receive over 20,000 
hits per *day* and do well over $100,000 in Internet sales 
per month--not from expensive advertising, but all from a
single Yahoo listing.




----------------

YAHOO! REJECTS 90% OF ALL SUBMITTED WEB SITES--BE IN THE 10%


PROBLEM: In case you didn't know, Yahoo!'s staff rejects 
over 90% of the submissions they receive. 


SOLUTION: Our R&amp;D division has studied hundreds of sites--
both those that have been successfuly indexed and those that 
have been rejected.

SOLUTION: Based on our findings, we've helped hundreds of 
clients not only get their site into the Yahoo! index, but 
into a very prominent place within that index. 

The Yahoo! Project Team can do the same for you.




----------------

MY SITE HAS ALREADY BEEN REJECTED BY YAHOO! WHAT CAN I DO?

PROBLEM: "I submitted my site to Yahoo! but it was rejected. 
What can I do now?"

SOLUTION: If your site has already been rejected--don't 
despair. We've helped many clients' sites get into Yahoo!'s 
index even after they've been rejected.





----------------

THE YAHOO! SITE SELECTION PROCESS--IN A NUTSHELL

"I can just submit my URL and be considered for a listing, 
right? It's easy, isn't it?"

No. It's not. Read on to learn why.


PROBLEM: Every site that gets accepted into the Yahoo! 
directory is scrutinized by a Yahoo! "editor." The first 
step in the submission process is to get an already 
overworked editor to look at your site.

SOLUTION: We have a carefully-researched technique to 
help your site's chances of being examined.



PROBLEM: Before submitting, your site *must* be prepared
for the Yahoo! editor's "10 minute lookover." In order
to grab that editor's attention--and get listed--you need
to understand what he or she will be examining to 
determine if your Web site gets a Yahoo! listing.  

SOLUTION: Our R&amp;D division has studied hundreds of Yahoo! 
rejection letters and learned why Yahoo! editors commonly 
reject sites. In short, we can *tell* you 




----------------

SOLUTION: THE "SECRETS TO GETTING A TOP YAHOO! LISTING" REPORT

We offer an information-packed "Secrets to getting a top 
Yahoo! listing" report that will tell you exactly what 
Yahoo! editors will be looking for when they evaluate your 
site. 

You can learn from hundreds of other people's mistakes so 
that you won't make them when submitting--or resubmitting--
your site.


Here's what's covered in the report:

&lt;&gt; A general overview of Yahoo! and how it works

&lt;&gt; The technical details of what they look for 

&lt;&gt; What *specific* types of content you *must* have

&lt;&gt; What *never* to do before submitting to Yahoo!

&lt;&gt; Why looking at your competitors is so important before
     submitting

&lt;&gt; The specifics of how to submit properly to skyrocket
     your chances

&lt;&gt; The best-kept secret on the net: this single submission 
     technique alone has achieved top rankings for many of
     our clients!
   

----------------

FOR THE SERIOUS SITE OWNER--THE CUSTOMIZED YAHOO! EVALUATION


We also offer a "Customized Evaluation" service where we'll 
examine your site like a Yahoo! editor will--and tell you, 
step-by-step, each of the changes you'll need to make before 
submitting to Yahoo!.


The "Customized Evaluation" includes all of the information 
from the "Secrets to getting a top Yahoo! listing" report *plus*:

&lt;&gt; A customized evaluation of your competitors' sites and why 
      they are so important to consider before submitting

&lt;&gt; An evaluation of your site's technical specs. and 
      recommendations for improving them

&lt;&gt; An evaluation of your site's content and recommendations 
      for improving it
