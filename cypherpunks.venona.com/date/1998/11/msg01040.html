Can Modern Technology be used to put women into a more "receptive mood?" 
Can Modern Technology be used to make women "more attractive" to men?

"WOW. Thanks for a sexual experience I did not dream possible without drugs." 
          HP Manhattan, NY 
  
According to Dr. Martin Feinberg: 
       "This is an amazing and unique tape. The sounds were designed to stimultate brain centers. To enhance pleasure. Reach new levels of sexual experiences without any chemicals or drugs but rather by allowing you mind to be stimulated by audio signals. The velvet voice provides a hypnotic-like state that produces a flow of intense pleasure and satisfaction. All that you need to do is listen." 

Hundreds of Tapes have been sold -- and rarely has one been returned. It is fully guaranteed to work as advertised or your money is refunded. You have NOTHING to lose. 

The Ecstasy tape was designed by a licensed Mental Health Counsellor specifically for her clients who had problems meeting the opposite sex, attracting the opposite sex, and having great sex with the opposite sex. Clinically tested, and set to digital music specifically designed to enhance the effects of the tape, you may never find another 
tape like it. Not yet sold in stores, it is only available on the Internet.
