   Letter claims it was 
   contaminated with Anthrax 
   29 people are contained, decontaminated at 
   Planned Parenthood clinic 
  
   By Stephen Beaven 
   Indianapolis Star/News 

   INDIANAPOLIS (Oct. 30, 1998) -- At least 29 
   people were treated Friday afternoon for 
   possible exposure to the deadly biological toxin 
   Anthrax at a Planned Parenthood clinic at East 
   21st Street and Ritter Avenue. 

   The FBI confirmed late Friday afternoon that 
   clinics in New Albany and Bloomington 
   received similar threats. 

   The Planned Parenthood eastside clinic received 
   a letter shortly after 1 p.m. with a simple 
   message -- you have been exposed to Anthrax, 
   according to the Indianapolis Fire Department. 

   Police and health and safety workers swooped in 
   soon after to quarantine the people in the 
   building. At least a dozen professionals from the 
   fire department's hazardous materials team 
   entered the building in white decontamination 
   suits with surgical masks and safety glasses to 
   treat those inside. 

   After being scrubbed down, the people in the 
   clinic were being taken to area hospitals late 
   Friday afternoon. 

   "The last thing we want to do is contaminate a 
   hospital," said one police official on the scene. 
   "No one is showing symptoms at this time, but 
   they are scared and upset." 

   A worker at the clinic opened a plain beige 
   envelope with a Cincinnati postmark Friday 
   afternoon. Inside there was a simple letter with 
   the threat. 

   It was unclear if the letter actually contained 
   Anthrax, which is generally used in biological 
   warfare and terrorism. 

   But even if it was a hoax, it looked real, 
   according to IFD Lt. Jack Cassaday. 

   "It looked like Anthrax so whoever sent it knew 
   enough to package it the right way," he said. 

   It has not been confirmed that the letter indeed 
   was contaminated with Anthrax. The substance 
   was being tested at a local lab, Cassaday added. 

   The bacteria Anthrax has flu-like symptoms 
   which do not surface until one to six days. 

   The symptoms are high fever, chest pains and 
   hemmoraging.
