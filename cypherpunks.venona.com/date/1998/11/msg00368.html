&gt; 
&gt;     9 November 1998
&gt; 
&gt;     DATELINE--Tallahassee, Fla.
&gt;     Oranges that get you high
&gt;     ===========================
&gt; 
&gt;     A Florida Biochemist designs a citrus tree with THC.
&gt; 
&gt;     In the summer of 1984, 10th-grader Irwin Nanofsky and a
&gt;     friend were driving down the Apalachee Parkway on the way
&gt;     home from baseball practice when they were pulled over by
&gt;     a police officer for a minor traffic infraction.
&gt; 
&gt;     After Nanofsky produced his driver's license the police
&gt;     officer asked permission to search the vehicle. In less
&gt;     than two minutes, the officer found a homemade pipe
&gt;     underneath the passenger's seat of the Ford Aerostar
&gt;     belonging to the teenage driver's parents. The minivan
&gt;     was seized, and the two youths were taken into custody on
&gt;     suspicion of drug possession.
&gt; 
&gt;     Illegal possession of drug paraphernalia ranks second
&gt;     only to open container violations on the crime blotter of
&gt;     this Florida college town. And yet the routine arrest of
&gt;     16 year-old Nanofsky and the seizure of his family's
&gt;     minivan would inspire one of the most controversial
&gt;     drug-related scientific discoveries of the century.
&gt; 
&gt;     Meet Hugo Nanofsky, biochemist, Florida State University
&gt;     tenured professor, and the parental authority who posted
&gt;     bail for Irwin Nanofsky the night of July 8, 1984. The
&gt;     elder Nanofsky wasn't pleased that his son had been
&gt;     arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, and he
&gt;     became livid when Tallahassee police informed him that
&gt;     the Aerostar minivan would be permanently remanded to
&gt;     police custody.
&gt; 
&gt;     Over the course of the next three weeks, Nanofsky penned
&gt;     dozens of irate letters to the local police chief, the
&gt;     Tallahassee City Council, the State District Attorney
&gt;     and, finally, even to area newspapers. But it was all to
&gt;     no avail.
&gt; 
&gt;     Under advisement of the family lawyer, Irwin Nanofsky
&gt;     pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia in order
&gt;     to receive a suspended sentence and have his juvenile
&gt;     court record sealed. But in doing so, the family minivan
&gt;     became "an accessory to the crime." According to Florida
&gt;     State law, it also became the property of the Tallahassee
&gt;     Police Department Drug Task Force. In time, the adult
&gt;     Nanofsky would learn that there was nothing he could do
&gt;     legally to wrest the vehicle from the hands of the state.
&gt; 
&gt;     It was in the fall of 1984 that         Biochem 101: How to
&gt;     John Chapman Professor of               design a
&gt;     Biochemistry at Florida State           Cannabis-equivalent
&gt;     University, now driving to work         citrus plant
&gt;     behind the wheel of a used Pontiac
&gt;     Bonneville, first set on a pet          Step One:
&gt;     project that he hoped would             Biochemically
&gt;     "dissolve irrational legislation        isolate all the
&gt;     with a solid dose of reason."           required enzymes for
&gt;     Nanofsky knew he would never get        the production of
&gt;     his family's car back, but he had       THC.
&gt;     plans to make sure that no one
&gt;     else would be pulled through the        Step Two:
&gt;     gears of what he considers a            Perform N-terminal
&gt;     Kafka-esque drug enforcement            sequencing on
&gt;     bureaucracy.                            isolated enzymes,
&gt;                                             design degenerate
&gt;     "It's quite simple, really,"            PCR (polymerase
&gt;     Nanofsky explains, "I wanted to         chain reaction)
&gt;     combine Citrus sinesis with Delta       primers and amplify
&gt;     9-tetrahydrocannabinol." In             the genes.
&gt;     layman's terms, the respected
&gt;     college professor proposed to grow      Step Three:
&gt;     oranges that would contain THC,         Clone genes into an
&gt;     the active ingredient in                agrobacterial vector
&gt;     marijuana. Fourteen years later,        by introducing the
&gt;     that project is complete, and           desired piece of DNA
&gt;     Nanofsky has succeeded where his        into a plasmid containing
&gt;     letter writing campaign of yore         a transfer or T-DNA.
&gt;     failed: he has the undivided            The mixture is transformed

&gt;     enforcement agencies, political         tumefaciens, a gram
&gt;     figures, and media outlets.             negative bacterium.
&gt; 
&gt;     The turning point in the Nanofsky       Step Four:
&gt;     saga came when the straight-laced       Use the Agrobacterium
&gt;     professor posted a message to           tumefaciens to infect citrus
&gt;     Internet newsgroups announcing          plants after wounding. The
&gt;     that he was offering                    transfer DNA will proceed
&gt;     "cannabis-equivalent orange tree        to host cells by a mechanism
&gt;     seeds" at no cost via the U.S.          similar to conjugation.
&gt;     mail. Several weeks later, U.S.         The DNA is randomly
&gt;     Justice Department officials            integrated into the
&gt;     showed up at the mailing address        host genome and will
&gt;     used in the Internet announcement:      be inherited.
&gt;     a tiny office on the second floor
&gt;     of the Dittmer Laboratory of
&gt;     Chemistry building on the FSU campus. There they would wait
&gt;     for another 40 minutes before Prof. Nanofsky finished
&gt;     delivering a lecture to graduate students on his recent
&gt;     research into the "cis-trans photoisomerization of olefins."
&gt; 
&gt;     "I knew it was only a matter of time before someone sent
&gt;     me more than just a self-addressed stamped envelope,"
&gt;     Nanofsky quips, "but I was surprised to see Janet Reno's
&gt;     special assistant at my door." After a series of closed
&gt;     door discussions, Nanofsky agreed to cease distribution
&gt;     of the THC-orange seeds until the legal status of the
&gt;     possibly narcotic plant species is established.
&gt; 
&gt;     Much to the chagrin of authorities, the effort to
&gt;     regulate Nanofsky's invention may be too little too late.
&gt;     Several hundred packets containing 40 to 50 seeds each
&gt;     have already been sent to those who've requested them,
&gt;     and Nanofsky is not obliged to produce his mailing
&gt;     records. Under current law, no crime has been committed
&gt;     and it is unlikely that charges will be brought against
&gt;     the fruit's inventor.
&gt; 
&gt;     Now it is federal authorities who must confront the
&gt;     nation's unwieldy body of inconsistent drug laws.
&gt;     According to a source at the Drug Enforcement Agency, it
&gt;     may be months if not years before all the issues involved
&gt;     are sorted out, leaving a gaping hole in U.S. drug policy
&gt;     in the meantime. At the heart of the confusion is the
&gt;     fact that THC now naturally occurs in a new species of
&gt;     citrus fruit.
&gt; 
&gt;     As policy analysts and hemp advocates alike have been
&gt;     quick to point out, the apparent legality (for now) of
&gt;     Nanofsky's "pot orange" may render debates over the
&gt;     legalization of marijuana moot. In fact, Florida's top
&gt;     law enforcement officials admit that even if the
&gt;     cultivation of Nanofsky's orange were to be outlawed, it
&gt;     would be exceedingly difficult to identify the presence
&gt;     of outlawed fruit among the state's largest agricultural
&gt;     crop.
&gt; 
&gt;     Amidst all of the hubbub surrounding his father's
&gt;     experiment, Irwin Nanofsky exudes calm indifference. Now
&gt;     30-years-old and a successful environmental photographer,
&gt;     the younger Nanofsky can't understand what all of the
&gt;     fuss is about. "My dad's a chemist. He makes polymers. I
&gt;     doubt it ever crossed his mind that as a result of his
&gt;     work tomorrow's kids will be able to get high off of half
&gt;     an orange."
