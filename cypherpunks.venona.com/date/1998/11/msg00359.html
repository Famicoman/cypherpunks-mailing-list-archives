&gt;
&gt; Hm, interesting choice of terms for comparison. So you're admitting that
&gt; anarcho-whatever isn't a social do-gooder, the intent is not to make the
&gt; system better or more equitable. Rather you're admitting, apparently
&gt; tacitly, that the goal of the anarcho-whatever is personal rather than
&gt; social improvement. There is also a further tacit admission with this
&gt; system won't address the social ills that plague us currently.
&gt;

I used to be an anarcho-capitalist, but concluded I was far too selfish. In fact, if
you'd read the first line about the libertarian compromize, rather than looking for
hooks, you'd see that I was attempting rapprochement.  Mostly I'm not at all
interested in being drawn into political wastings of energy, life is too short.  I
made my choice 25 years ago, and have been (largely) free and untaxed for that time.
Harry Browne's "How I found freedom in an unfree world" came along at about the same
time I cut loose from the nation-state.

Why the pejorative use of "anarcho-whatever" and the whole personal level at which you
pitch your responses?  Is it your intent to stir up anger by using imflammatory
rhetoric?  Or (more likely) is this an example of newspeak? Whatever, it comes across
as mean-spirited and sad. An indicator perhaps, of someone who loves to "go for the
jugular".  A common "small man" trait. Are you a small man Jim? Do you need the power
of the state to make you feel big by proxy?

One thing the anarcho-capitalist rants all contain, is frustration at being under the
thumb of authority.  They believe that outlawing big thumbs will fix this.  Until that
happy day (should it ever occur), I have perceived that big thumbs are very clumsy. I
prefer to move rapidly enough that they have difficulty in pinning me down, numbering
me, punching and spindling me.  My domiciles tend to be in nation-states that provide
safe havens to those who have stuff that the big thumbs would like to expropriate. I
visited and left the US at about the time the streets paved with gold turned to the
streets paved with goldbrickers.

Some of the socialist propaganda leaked out in your posting.  Why would I be concerned
about curing "social ills"?  I'm fully tied up in interacting with my own little
society -- my parents, siblings, children, friends, pets, possessions.  Why would I
need or desire any other (arbitrary) social connections?  I don't have your missionary
zeal I suppose. All such change that I could effect would be as nothing, seen from the
perspective of 100 years in the future. I'd hate to be branded as a 'deadbeat dad' by
my nakama because I was paying more attention to righting abstract wrongs, than
reading to my children. Pillory Klinton was almost correct; it does take a village, or
buggering off to live in one and leaving the neo-roman empiricists to prop up their
ailing support system without me.

If you are more concerned about addressing social ills than your personal life, I feel
sorry for you.  If you want to make a contribution to the social ills I have
accumulated however, I'll send you my numbered account details and you can deposit
directly.

&gt; &gt; &lt;P&gt;Last time I looked at it, there were 108 separate taxes included in
&gt; &gt; the retail cost of an egg and 112 for a loaf of bread, so yes, I would
&gt;
&gt; I'd like a reference to this particular list if possible.

Go find it yourself.  I'm not a charitable or state institution.  Here's a hint though
-- Ralph Nader, comsumer watchdogs.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;P&gt;One question for the socialists out there;&amp;nbsp; when is the promised
&gt; &gt; egalitarian utopia&amp;nbsp; going to kick in?&amp;nbsp; It doesn't seem to be
&gt; &gt; getting any closer.&lt;/HTML&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'd ask the same question of the anarcho-whatever but you took care of it so
&gt; adroitely above...
&gt;

Very good point. I take it as reinforcing the correctness of my decision to opt-out.
