        [exploration] Corporate Welfare: A Media Issue At Last? (fwd)

     For many years, across the United States, huge quantities of
&gt;tax breaks and subsidies have been going to corporations.
&gt;Occasionally, the media spotlight falls on an example of how
&gt;government policies stand Robin Hood on his head -- shaking down
&gt;the poor and middle class while handing over the proceeds to
&gt;wealthy individuals and big businesses.
&gt;
&gt;     Sometimes called "corporate welfare," this pattern of
&gt;legalized rip-offs has been widespread -- yet little of the story
&gt;seems to emerge in major news outlets. Overall, the coverage is
&gt;sporadic at best. In mass media, the broader picture has been
&gt;missing -- until the last few weeks.
&gt;
&gt;     November brought a series of breakthroughs, thanks to two
&gt;gifted reporters and a news weekly that allowed them to engage in
&gt;rigorous journalism. All month, beginning with a cover story on
&gt;"What Corporate Welfare Costs You," Time magazine featured
&gt;extraordinary exposes by Donald Barlett and James Steele.
&gt;
&gt;     Corporate welfare, they write, is "a game in which
&gt;governments large and small subsidize corporations large and
&gt;small, usually at the expense of another state or town and almost
&gt;always at the expense of individuals and other corporate
&gt;taxpayers."
&gt;
&gt;     Barlett and Steele report that "the federal government alone
&gt;shells out $125 billion a year in corporate welfare." Meanwhile,
&gt;"a different kind of feeding frenzy is taking place" at the state
&gt;and local level -- where "politicians stumble over one another in
&gt;the rush to arrange special deals for select corporations."
&gt;
&gt;     In theory, the giveaways create jobs. In practice, the
&gt;theory is hogwash: "Time's investigation has established that
&gt;almost without exception, local and state politicians have doled
&gt;out tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to businesses that are
&gt;in fact eliminating rather than creating jobs."
&gt;
&gt;     Often, when localities roll out the gold carpet for firms,
&gt;government coffers shrink -- and services for the public
&gt;diminish. As Barlett and Steele document in excruciating detail,
&gt;one of the common results is health-threatening pollution that
&gt;goes unchallenged. The most vulnerable neighborhoods tend to be
&gt;where low-income people live.
&gt;
&gt;     The big hogs at the tax-funded trough include popular brands
&gt;-- Intel and Dow, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz, Exxon and
&gt;Shell, UPS and Procter &amp; Gamble, to name just a few. Some are the
&gt;parent companies of media empires, such as Walt Disney (ABC),
&gt;General Electric (NBC) and -- as the Time series acknowledges --
&gt;Time Warner.
&gt;
&gt;     "The king of corporate welfare may be Archer Daniels
&gt;Midland," according to Time. "The global agricultural-commodities
&gt;dealer has artfully preserved one of the more blatant welfare
&gt;programs -- a subsidy for ethanol that has already cost taxpayers
&gt;more than $5 billion in the 1990s. Some $3 billion of that has
&gt;gone to ADM."
&gt;
&gt;     Year after year, Archer Daniels Midland has poured several
&gt;million dollars into the nightly PBS "NewsHour" television show
&gt;hosted by Jim Lehrer. ADM is also an underwriter of National
&gt;Public Radio news. And the savvy firm buys a lot of image ads on
&gt;commercial TV network programs that discuss political issues. Not
&gt;surprisingly, ADM hasn't been subjected to much tough reporting
&gt;on the national airwaves.
&gt;
&gt;     Corporate welfare is an important issue. But it can easily
&gt;be spun in dubious directions. For instance, in an article
&gt;addressed "To Our Readers," Time's editor-in-chief Norman
&gt;Pearlstine throws a wide curve that breaks sharply downward and
&gt;to the right.
&gt;
&gt;     "Ending corporate welfare as we know it is essential,"
&gt;Pearlstine contends. But then comes the english: "Rather than
&gt;give corporations uneven and unfair exemptions, it may make more
&gt;sense to simply do away with both corporate welfare and corporate
&gt;taxation."
&gt;
&gt;     Now there's an idea that Time Warner can get behind: Stop
&gt;taxing corporations!
&gt;
&gt;     Another hazard is the temptation to put all forms of
&gt;government assistance in the same "welfare" category. It would be
&gt;a big mistake to equate government aid to dependent corporations
&gt;with safety-net subsidies for children, seniors and others
&gt;struggling at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder.
&gt;
&gt;     Government should not be using tax dollars to help the rich
&gt;get richer. But government has no business refusing to help
&gt;Americans get the nutrition, health care, housing and other
&gt;basics that are everyone's human right.
&gt;
&gt;     Welcome as it is, the occasional blockbuster expose of
&gt;corporate abuses -- even in a media outlet as influential as Time
&gt;magazine -- won't accomplish very much. Without an "echo effect,"
&gt;these issues are likely to remain muted.
&gt;
&gt;     The need to speak up and take action is a burden that falls
&gt;on people in every community. Large corporations have been
&gt;ripping us off for decades. Our initial efforts to force
&gt;restitution will not be televised.
