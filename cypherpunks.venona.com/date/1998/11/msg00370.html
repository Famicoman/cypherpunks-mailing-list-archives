Clinton Wants Loophole In U.S. Gun Law Closed

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Clinton directed his government Saturday
to find a way to close a legal loophole that allows dealers to sell guns at
gun shows with no questions asked.

In his weekly radio address, Clinton said a ``dangerous trend'' is emerging
at gun shows because the Brady handgun control law permits some firearms to
be sold without background checks at these shows.

``Some of these gun shows have become illegal arms bazaars for criminals
and gun traffickers looking to buy and sell guns on a cash-and-carry,
no-questions-asked basis,'' Clinton said. 

He directed Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Attorney General Janet Reno
to report back to him in 60 days with a plan to close the loophole and
prohibit any gun sale without a background check.

``I believe this should be the law of the land: No background check, no
gun, no exceptions,'' Clinton said.

In a fact sheet, the White House said that every year about 5 million
people attend an estimated 5,000 gun shows at convention centers, school
gyms and on fairgrounds.

The Brady law requires a five-day waiting period for gun purchasers in
order for a background check. On Nov. 30, the FBI's National Instant
Criminal Background Check System is set to take effect to allow quicker
checks and approve gun sales within minutes.

In addition, on Nov. 30 the law will be strengthened in two ways: purchases
of all firearms, not just handguns, will be subject to Brady background
checks as will pawnshop redemptions, which are four times as likely to
involve a prohibited purchase.

Overall, the White House said, it is estimated that the number of
background checks conducted nationally will increase from 4 million to
between 10 and 12 million.

Unregulated sales at gun shows were ``an open invitation to criminals,''
said Sarah Brady, who chairs Handgun Control Inc. The Brady law was named
after her husband, James Brady, who was wounded in an attack on President
Ronald Reagan in 1981.

California and Maryland regulate ``flea market'' gun sales, said Brady.
Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment Tuesday giving counties
the power to require a waiting period and a background check for sales at
gun shows and other public places.
