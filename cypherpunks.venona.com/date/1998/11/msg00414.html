--interrupt--

I would question, sagely (IMHO), 

do not confuse the military budget- you know, the Military budget- with the
NSA portion of the military budget- last I heard they were getting about
1/3rd. Meanwhile, the lowly Military- Navy at least, is operating at 3 or 4
X the prior tempo with a significantly reduced portion of that military
budget.

Gee, is the current administration trying to reduce military infrastructure
by wearing it out- and not purchasing repair parts or replacements???

Or all the dollars going towards the DNA database, Echelon, and ???

--resume usual conversation--


&gt;What is annoying is "charity" (social security) at the point of a gun.
&gt;Our "conscience" is being decided by government which is acting as a
&gt;broker for those lobby for their "need" and for your assets to be
&gt;stolen and redistributed to them.
&gt;
&gt;What people aren't willing to pay for shouldn't happen.  Period.  If
&gt;that means people starve well those complaining loudest had better
&gt;dig deeper into their pockets.
&gt;
&gt;Anything else is socialism tending to facism, as Hayek argues in The
&gt;Road to Serfdom.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;No state can govern those who don't wish to be governed, violence or no.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	Yes, but a state can kill those who don't wish to be governed. Can
&gt;&gt; and does routinely.
&gt;
&gt;That's what's so interesting about cyberspace, once the payment
&gt;systems get there -- government thugs can't beat up, murder, or
&gt;incarcerate anonymous nyms.  _Then_ Jim's "No state can govern those
&gt;who don't wish to be governed" starts to become true.

	If you see a man approaching you with the obvious intention 
	of doing you good, you should run for your life.
