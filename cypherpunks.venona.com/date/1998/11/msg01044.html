RPK SECURITY ADDS C SOURCE LIBRARY AND SOLARIS PORT TO ENCRYPTONITE POWERFUL PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION TOOLKIT 

SAN FRANCISCO, CA. November 3, 1998 - RPK Security, Inc. (www.rpkusa.com), a technology leader in fast public key encryption, announced today the addition of a Solaris port and C source library to its RPK Encryptonite Software Toolkit version 3.0. The RPK Toolkit enables integrators, developers and engineers to quickly and easily incorporate fast public key encryption and strong security into applications, without knowledge of cryptography.

The RPK Toolkit, a software implementation of the RPK Encryptonite Engine, allows developers to build custom applications with strong encryption for information sensitive applications and industries such as Internet, communications, legal, health care and financial services. The Toolkit provides 40 percent improvement in engine initialization (compared with V2.1), resulting in remarkably better application response times.  With a new "packet encryption" technique, the RPK Toolkit is well suited for broadcast and multi-cast applications, especially on the Internet. 

"Because the RPK Toolkit is developed outside of the U.S., it is not subject to U.S. export laws which gives a tremendous advantage to international customers, allowing them to produce secure, fast and flexible systems with strong encryption," said Jack Oswald, president and CEO of RPK Security.

The RPK Encryptonite Engine uniquely combines all the benefits of other public key systems (authentication, digital signatures and digital certificates) with the speed of a secret key system into one algorithm. With the Encryptonite Engine's superior performance, applications requiring streaming data, sound, video or numerous transactions, such as credit card payments, receive instantaneous responses and secure communication links. The RPK Toolkit includes: ANSI standard C/C++ libraries for Win95/98/NT, HP/UX, Sun Solaris (C only) and Linux, Delphi 3.0/4.0 VCL component for Win95/NT, DLL and ActiveX.  It also has been compiled and tested with Visual C++, Borland C++ Builder and gnu/g++.

Pricing and Availability:
The RPK Encryptonite Software Toolkit is available for licensing worldwide. Pricing starts at $695 per developer (development only). Deployment license fees are based upon custom configurations. For sales information, call (415) 563-1800 or e-mail sales@rpkusa.com
