&gt; Date: Mon, 02 Nov 1998 20:41:24 -0500
&gt; From: John Young &lt;jya@pipeline.com&gt;
&gt; Subject: RE: Bic-Assassins Convicted (fwd)

&gt; Jim Choate asked:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If they had threatened just a plain old citizen with this 
&gt; &gt;email would they also be facing this life imprisonment?
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently the charges would have been the same if made 
&gt; against any 
&gt; 
&gt;   "person within the United States, and the results of such 
&gt;   use affect interstate or foreign commerce or, in the case 
&gt;   of a threat, attempt, or conspiracy, would have affected 
&gt;   interstate or foreign commerce." (see below)

Ok, exactly how would their threat effect inter-state commerce?

&gt; The use of E-mail was incidental to the charges of both 
&gt; conspiracy and threatening to use weapons of mass destruction:
&gt; 
&gt;   18:2332(a)(2) and (c)(2)(C). Conspiracy to use a weapon 
&gt;   of mass destruction against person(s) w/in the U.S. 
&gt;   the results of which affected interstate &amp; foreign 
&gt;   commerce.  Offense dates:  3/24/98 - 6/30/98.  Penalty:  
&gt;   Any term of years or for life, $250,000, 5 yrs SRT.  (1)

Conspiracy requires active steps, not simply talking about it. As I
understand it the conspiracy and weapons of mass destructions charges were
given a not-guilty by the jury. No proof was presented that they had ever
even bought a bic lighter to test with. Hell, even going to the bookstore
and buying a book or the library and checking one out is protected under the
Constitution. It takes more than talk to generate a conspiracy.

&gt;   18:2332a(a)(2) and (c)(2)(C) and 2.  Threatening to use a
&gt;   weapon of mass destruction. Offense date:  6/26/98
&gt;   Penalty:  any term of years or Proceedings include all events.
&gt;   for life, $250,000, 5 yrs SRT as to ea ct. (2 - 8)

If we're going to go by this then the US government is already guilty re
their plan to destroy various contraband plants via genetic weapons. If you
think that won't effect inter-state &amp; international commerce you better
think again.

And they've gone a lot farther than just talking about it in email. Congress
has spent millions on it over the last few years.

&gt; The eight counts are for the one count of conspiracy and
&gt; threats against seven federal agencies ("employees and
&gt; families"):
&gt; 
&gt;   The President
&gt;   ATF
&gt;   FBI
&gt;   DEA
&gt;   IRS
&gt;   Secret Service
&gt;   Custom Service

Ok, so my question still stands what if these had been actual people instead
of government agencies? The charges are *NOT* for threatening individuals
who happen to be government agents, oh no, they're for threatening
government *agencies* a whole different ball game ('The President' is an
office not a person).

&gt; CHAPTER 113B - TERRORISM
&gt; 
&gt; Sec. 2332a. Use of weapons of mass destruction
&gt; 
&gt;  (a) Offense Against a National of the United States or Within the
&gt; United States. - A person who, without lawful authority, uses,
&gt; threatens, or attempts or conspires to use, a weapon of mass
&gt; destruction, including any biological agent, toxin, or vector (as
&gt; those terms are defined in section 178) -

Where is 'lawful authority' defined?

&gt;    (2) against any person within the United States, and the
&gt;   results of such use affect interstate or foreign commerce or, in
&gt;   the case of a threat, attempt, or conspiracy, would have affected
&gt;   interstate or foreign commerce;

I covered this one already.

&gt;  (c) Definitions. - For purposes of this section -
&gt; 
&gt;    (2) the term ''weapon of mass destruction'' means -
&gt; 
&gt;       (A) any destructive device as defined in section 921 of this
&gt;      title;
&gt; 
&gt;       (B) any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or
&gt;      serious bodily injury through the release, dissemination, or
&gt;      impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals, or their precursors;
&gt; 
&gt;       (C) any weapon involving a disease organism; or

So if I go out and sneeze on somebody I've committed an attack using a
weapon of mass destruction?

&gt;       (D) any weapon that is designed to release radiation or
&gt;      radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life.

Where is the definition of 'mass' in there? Hell, just about anything
qualifies under this definition. It doesn't even require the death of 1
single individual (it doesn't even require it to be lethal).

Oh, *all* radiation is harmful to human life.

&gt; CHAPTER 10 - BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
&gt; Sec. 178. Definitions
&gt; 
&gt;   As used in this chapter -
&gt; 
&gt;     (1) the term ''biological agent'' means any micro-organism,
&gt;   virus, infectious substance, or biological product that may be
&gt;   engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally
&gt;   occurring or bioengineered component of any such microorganism,
&gt;   virus, infectious substance, or biological product, capable of
&gt;   causing -
&gt; 
&gt;       (A) death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a
&gt;     human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism;

Well this certainly covers each and every effect of a pathogen on a
biological system (I particularly like the way they've covered their butts
for ET.... 'another living organism'. Not to mention that cleaning your
kitchen counter qualifies under this statute.

&gt;       (B) deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or
&gt;     material of any kind; or
&gt; 
&gt;       (C) deleterious alteration of the environment;

Well at least they've set themselves up for their anti-drug pathogen
program.

&gt;     (2) the term ''toxin'' means the toxic material of plants,

Can you say circular defintion, I thought you could. This sentence say
nothing.

&gt;   animals, microorganisms, viruses, fungi, or infectious
&gt;   substances, or a recombinant molecule, whatever its origin or
&gt;   method of production, including -
&gt; 
&gt;       (A) any poisonous substance or biological product that may be
&gt;     engineered as a result of biotechnology produced by a living
&gt;     organism; or
&gt; 
&gt;       (B) any poisonous isomer or biological product, homolog, or
&gt;     derivative of such a substance;

This of course happens to cover plain old water (re 'whatever its origin or
method of preduction').

&gt;     (3) the term ''delivery system'' means -
&gt; 
&gt;       (A) any apparatus, equipment, device, or means of delivery
&gt;     specifically designed to deliver or disseminate a biological
&gt;     agent, toxin, or vector; or
&gt; 
&gt;       (B) any vector;
&gt; 
&gt;     (4) the term ''vector'' means a living organism, or molecule,
&gt;   including a recombinant molecule, or biological product that may
&gt;   be engineered as a result of biotechnology, capable of carrying a
&gt;   biological agent or toxin to a host; and

Next time I get food-poisoning at a restaraunt it's comforting to know that
the federal government will be right there to prosecute under this
particular statute...

Geesh.
