&gt; &gt; &gt; nihilistic so much as they have come to the conclusion that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to ignore and/or subvert government has higher probability 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of success than trying to reform it -- much to the demise 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Libertarian Party.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is certainly little historical evidence to support such 
&gt; &gt; a thesis.
&gt; 
&gt; My thesis that this is a common sentiment?

You can't both ignore and subvert. One is passive the other is active. Now
if your thesis holds that this is a commen sentiment then you're in big
trouble finding mass support (which is what your theory would require to be
valid). I would say the vast majority of people don't share your views.

&gt; history, try looking around. No, I'm talking 1950's to present, and
&gt; particularly 1990's and the internet-libertarian culture. I think this
&gt; sentiment is historically unprecedented.

The technology is certainly unprecedented, I doubt there has been a single
new human emotion or perspective developed because of it; only new venues
for the same old human failings and foibles. Or by sentiment do you mean your
view of nihilism? If so I would suggest you study nihilism closer.

&gt; The thesis that to ignore the nation-state will see it's demise?

Historicaly strategies reducable to a ostrich_with_its_head_in_the_sand have
not worked well in changing peoples minds nor motivating them to action, let
alone causing the demise of a nation state. This isn't surprising if you
consider the types of personalities that lead people.

&gt; Well we
&gt; really need a financial system that they don't control, which has been
&gt; promised with financial cryptography but has yet to arrive. I don't think
&gt; it's time to throw in the towel yet.

I'll disagree regarding free-market economies. As to throwing in the towel,
we agree there.
