Thanks.

Freedom Partnership Program: Value-Added Service For ISPs

Zero-Knowledge Systems is currently in seeking ISPs to join as "Founding
Members" in the Freedom Network. Freedom is revolutionary software that
provides the first complete privacy solution to Internet users, including
email, web-browsing, chat, telnet and Usenet. By allowing users to create
and manage multiple authenticated identities and using full-strength
cryptography, Internet users can also block SPAM and manage their person
information. See <A  HREF="http://www.zks.net">http://www.zks.net</A> for full details.

Being a member of the Freedom Network will allow an ISP to differentiate
itself from the competition while fighting for on-line privacy. The Freedom
Partnership Program has been designed to be revenue generating and cost
reducing for ISPs.

Freedom software is provided free of charge to all ISPs. Internal
beta-testing of the Freedom network will begin in mid-December, 1998 and the
"Founding Members" of the Freedom Network should be prepared to begin
working with our technical staff at that time. Beta testing should last 4-8
weeks. The Freedom server software runs on a Linux or Solaris operating
system and needs to run on a
dedicated machine. Server participants should be able to contribute a T-1
during the beta testing period. Members will also be entitled to proceeds
from the revenue sharing program (after the beta testing period). The
revenue sharing program is designed to provide ISPs with 110% - 130% of
bandwidth costs.

Participation has its advantages. Founding Member ISPs will receive
"Preferred Member" status on our web-site and software. When users of the
Freedom client do a search for an ISP by telephone area code, Founding
Members will be the
recommended ISP in a given geographical area. All Founding Members will be
listed in relevant press releases made by Zero-Knowledge Systems. Founding
Members will also be guaranteed to earn 10% on all click-thru sales
(web-link program) for the next two years. Participating ISPs will also get
"Prominent Placement" - have their company name/logo displayed on a
high-traffic area of our web-site. Distinctive buttons and banners will be
given to all founding members receive  to put on their web-site.

Initially, the Freedom Network will be comprised of 15 Founding Member ISPs
which will be located around the world. We plan to have an ISP in each of
the following areas: Canada(3) - east coast, central, west coast;
U.S.A.(7) - northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, west coast, silicon
valley, Midwest; United Kingdom(1); Holland(1); Germany(1); Australia(1);
and, the Caribbean(1).

If you are interested in becoming a "Founding Member" or simply joining the
Freedom Network or know of an ISP that would be interested, please contact
Greg Adelstein, Director of Business Development, Zero-Knowledge Systems,
greg@zks.net or 514-286-2636.
