&gt; Subject: Re: How to solve the tax problem w/o anarchy or force (fwd)

&gt; I used to be an anarcho-capitalist, but concluded I was far too selfish. In fact, if
&gt; you'd read the first line about the libertarian compromize, rather than looking for
&gt; hooks, you'd see that I was attempting rapprochement.  Mostly I'm not at all
&gt; interested in being drawn into political wastings of energy, life is too short.  I
&gt; made my choice 25 years ago, and have been (largely) free and untaxed for that time.
&gt; Harry Browne's "How I found freedom in an unfree world" came along at about the same
&gt; time I cut loose from the nation-state.

You're speaking of federal taxes, or you don't own property in your own
name. I suppose you wouldn't call the fire dept. if your house caught on
fire since you don't pay taxes. You wouldn't call the police if there was a
problem either.

&gt; Why the pejorative use of "anarcho-whatever" and the whole personal level at which you
&gt; pitch your responses?  Is it your intent to stir up anger by using imflammatory
&gt; rhetoric?

No, my intent in wording is to get at the core of what is being proposed. A
characteristic of anarcho-whatever and lawyers is they never say what they
mean. If they did very few would give them the attention they get now.

&gt;  Or (more likely) is this an example of newspeak? Whatever, it comes across
&gt; as mean-spirited and sad. An indicator perhaps, of someone who loves to "go for the
&gt; jugular".  A common "small man" trait. Are you a small man Jim? Do you need the power
&gt; of the state to make you feel big by proxy?

IROFL.
