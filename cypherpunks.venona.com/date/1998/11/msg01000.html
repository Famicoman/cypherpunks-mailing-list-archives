&gt; Here's what is likely going on right now, though its
&gt; availability to LE is questionable:
&gt; 
&gt; NSA probably maintains surveillance of all or nearly all
&gt; encrypted remailers. They log and archive the content of
&gt; all traffic. First arrivals of messages in the remailer
&gt; "cloud" provide source identification in many cases, so

Well...

I just realized that the huge amount of spam that is being relayed
through remailers, might actually increase remailer security for
all of us. I understand that the remailer operators probably have
bandwidth limitations, but at least some spam is good.

Please do not fight spam as much as you do.

&gt; a database is gradually built of all the originating
&gt; email addresses and IP addresses that have ever sent
&gt; messages to a remailer. The same is true for the messages
&gt; exiting the cloud, although many of those go to public
&gt; lists or newsgroups. Sometimes, perhaps even often, the
&gt; remailer cloud is so little utilised that one-hop or even
&gt; multi-hop chained remalings are easily identified as to
&gt; source and final destination. All goes into the database.
&gt; Spook-style stylometers develop profiles of the users.
&gt; Over time, more and more of the unidentified profiles
&gt; become linked to known users. All it takes is one slip,
&gt; or one piece of bad luck of low traffic levels. Linkage
&gt; is also done on a probabilistic basis, many-to-many.
&gt; Little human intervention is used except to develop and
&gt; tune the correlation mechanisms. Filters aimed at content
&gt; that might help correlate messages with senders is more 
&gt; important to the spooks than Echelon Dictionary filters.
&gt; The priorities in getting a handle on something like the
&gt; remailer cloud are quite different than the priorities in
&gt; scanning ordinary traffic for content. Ultimately, though,
&gt; the regular content filters come into play, but in this
&gt; ongoing exercise of cat and mouse, the bulk of the effort
&gt; is directed at developing the combination of surveillance
&gt; and intelligent processing that can provide the basis for
&gt; identifying, at least to some knowable probability, the
&gt; sources and destinations of given remailer messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Source and destination correlation can benefit greatly
&gt; from knowledge of conventional email correspondent 
&gt; relationships. Most nonprofessional-spook people who send 
&gt; encrypted remailed email to a non-public destination are 
&gt; also likely to correspond with that destination in the 
&gt; clear. Archival logging of traffic is like a time machine -
&gt; even if one ceases conventional correspondence with
&gt; another, any past traffic can reveal the correspondence
&gt; relationship.
&gt; 
&gt; Mathematical correlation, given a very large amount of raw
&gt; data consisting of timestamped message events, can reveal
&gt; quite a lot about likely correspondence relationships.
&gt; Even given a remailer network full of chaff, with reordered
&gt; message pools and such, just running correlations on the
&gt; end point data - who sent and when, and who received and when
&gt; - can develop likely correspondent pairs.
&gt; 
&gt; Be assured that the manipulation of such data relies heavily
&gt; on probablistic clustering supported by database mechanisms
&gt; not seen much in business environments. Instead of having
&gt; firm relationships within an order or two of magnitude of
&gt; the terminal node population, I would want something that
&gt; allows having very large numbers of fuzzy relationships
&gt; numbering many orders of magnitude greater than the node
&gt; population. Nodes A, B, C and D send and receive remailer
&gt; traffic. Everything that A has ever sent is clearly
&gt; related to A, but each item can and likely would also
&gt; have a probabilistic relationship to B, C, and D. The
&gt; probability assignments would be updated as later analysis
&gt; and later data more clearly identify who may have received 
&gt; which messages. Content comes into play here, too.
&gt; 
&gt; At any time it is possible to query the database for
&gt; the likely correspondents of A, and the likely messages
&gt; A may have sent to B, C, or D, and get a result ordered
&gt; by confidence. Similarly, it is possible to query for
&gt; the likely sender(s) and recipient(s) of a given message.
&gt; Occasionally, data may be firmed up - meaning achieving 
&gt; higher confidence levels of the relationships - by access 
&gt; to someone's PC, by whatever means, by stylometry, by 
&gt; specific content of public messages, and by fortuitous 
&gt; traffic analysis successes owing to the paucity of remailer 
&gt; traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also certain that to provide realistic cases that can
&gt; be fully revealed to measure the efficacy of the various
&gt; algorithms and methods involved, spooks use the remailer
&gt; network themselves. That's the only way they can be sure
&gt; to have any traffic that can be fully analyzed as a yardstick
&gt; for the guessing games played by their software.
&gt; 
&gt; A few rules of thumb result from even cursory examination
&gt; of the likely environment:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Do not send clear messages through the remailers 
&gt;    except to public lists and newsgroups. Sending clear
&gt;    messages to private correspondents provides the 
&gt;    watchers with rich style and content material linked
&gt;    to a correspondent. It is usually easy then to link
&gt;    it back to you, and a firm correspondent pair is then
&gt;    established in their database.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Do not switch between clear and encrypted, remailed 
&gt;    communication with the same correspondent. If your
&gt;    correspondent relationships are mapped via clear,
&gt;    conventional mail, those mappings can be applied to
&gt;    your encrypted, remailed mail to greatly narrow 
&gt;    down the possible recipients, and quite likely 
&gt;    combine with traffic analysis to correlate your
&gt;    outgoing message with one arriving at your
&gt;    correspondent. If the only communications you have
&gt;    with your deep contacts is by encrypted, chained
&gt;    remailer, only fortuitous or statistical correlation
&gt;    analysis or access to your or your correspondent's
&gt;    host machines will tie the two of you together.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Do not send traffic to significant correspondents
&gt;    when traffic levels are likely to be low. Good
&gt;    luck at guessing this. Probably the best way to
&gt;    get a handle on traffic levels is to run a remailer
&gt;    yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Send lots of chaff. Chain some messages through the
&gt;    remailer cloud every day. If you have time and the
&gt;    ability, write and release something that will allow
&gt;    large numbers of people to send lots of chaff.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Ultimately, the only way the remailers will provide
&gt;    what might be described as Pretty Good Security will
&gt;    be when we have software that maintains a regular
&gt;    or random rate of messages to and from the remailer
&gt;    cloud, a stream into which the meaningful messages
&gt;    can be inserted with no visible change in traffic.
&gt;    Until then, the best we can do is try to keep traffic
&gt;    levels up, and to send and receive frequently enough
&gt;    to frustrate end-to-end traffic analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Don't send anything that can have grave consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Take names. Always take names. Some day...
