From: Matt Blaze &lt;mab@research.att.com&gt;

That you for CCing the enclosed message.

I must admit that I'm rather puzzled by it.  This is the first I've
head of an "E.M Cordian," or for that matter "M.F. Tones" or
"Mr. Rogue."  I am quite sure, however, that I am none of these
people.  I have also never seen, or claimed to have seen, any
description of the RSA algorithm, other than the the recently
declassified public key historical material from GCHQ, that predates
R, S and A's original paper on the subject.

I don't subscribe to the cypherpunks mailing list (or, for that
matter, DCSB), and I've only just now scanned over the web page
mentioned in your message, so I'm unclear as to what might be going
on.  Perhaps someone is confused about the $7.00 "better DES
challenge" that I offered last year (which was solved this year by the
EFF DES brute force hardware).

Whatever this is about, however, I assure you that any use of my name
in connection with a solicitation for funds for some sort of
"analytical DES cracking" effort, or any suggestion that I'm involved
in such a project, is absolutely false and perhaps fraudulent.

Feel free to forward this as you see fit.

Thanks

&gt;	Out on the Cypherpunks List, "Anonymous" claimed to reveal the real
&gt;identity of E.M. Cordian, the organizer of the DES Analytical Crack. See:
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.cyberspace.org/~enoch/crakfaq.html">http://www.cyberspace.org/~enoch/crakfaq.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Shouldn't we be using "Mr. Cordian's" real
&gt;&gt;name?  Matt Blaze (mab@research.att.com), also
&gt;&gt;occasionally known as "M.F. Tones", and even less
&gt;&gt;often as "Mr. Rouge" (There should be an accent mark
&gt;&gt;there actually).
&gt;
&gt;	In response, Robert Hettinga &lt;rah@shipwright.com&gt; declared:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just to clear the air a smidge.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If Matt Blaze says he's looking for an algebraic inverse to DES, I tend to
&gt;&gt;believe him...
&gt;
&gt;	Jeeze, Rob! This is your attempt to help "clear the air?"
&gt;
&gt;	I do not for a moment believe that Eric Michael Cordian
&gt;&lt;emc@wire.insync.net&gt; is a pseudonym for Matt Blaze &lt;mab@research.att.com&gt;!
&gt;
&gt;	You should maybe query Matt directly &lt;mab@research.att.com&gt; before
&gt;you endorse E.M. Cordian as Matt Blaze in drag. You could confuse a whole
&gt;lot of people who trust your insider knowledge of these steamy Net Affairs.
&gt;
&gt;	To anyone familiar with Blaze's essays, speeches, &amp; on-line posts,
&gt;a scan of  Mr. Codrian's FAQ and published comments should make it apparent
&gt;that this suggestion is unlikely, if not perposterous.
&gt;
&gt;	The real Matt Blaze would also not be making these absurd and false
&gt;claims that some mysterious "book" describing a cryptosystem identical or
&gt;equivalent to the RSA public key cryptosystem was published "years" before
&gt;Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adelman  first published their RSA PKC
&gt;algorithm in April, 1977.  (It's well documented in the Cypherpunk
&gt;archives, Codrian assures us;-)
&gt;
&gt;	There was no such book. Cordian's statement is just not true. The
&gt;real Matt Blaze -- the guy who wrote the pithy Afterward to Schneier's
&gt;Applied Cryptography,II -- would know that this is not true.
&gt;
&gt;	(Actually, I'd bet that even Robert Hettinga knows that this is
&gt;untrue.)
&gt;
&gt;	Mind you, if the real Matt Blaze announced that he was seeking $500
&gt;from twenty people to fund a private research project which he felt had a
&gt;meaningful chance of casting DES as a NP-hard combinatorial problem and
&gt;attacking it with an appropriate combinatorial algorithm, I'd send a check
&gt;off tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt;	The real Matt Blaze would not have 15 donors -- as Mr. Cordian
&gt;reports -- but be stimied on how to get five more.
&gt;
&gt;	I wish Mr. Cordian well in his algebraic attack on DES -- but,
&gt;unfortunately, he is not the real Matt Blaze. Not even a near-clone.
&gt;
&gt;	We could do with a few more professionals with Blaze's talent,
&gt;energy, and integrity in general circulation.
&gt;
&gt;	Suerte,
