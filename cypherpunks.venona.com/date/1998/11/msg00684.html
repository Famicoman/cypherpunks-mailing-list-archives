&gt; Received today by e-mail:
&gt; 
&gt; November 16, 1998
&gt; Springfield, Missouri
&gt; 
&gt; To:  friends of Carl Johnson, The Last Canadian
&gt; Outlaw (name of his last album)
&gt; 
&gt; From:   Alia Johnson
&gt; 
&gt; I saw CJ today at the Springfield facility for the
&gt; criminally disturbing. We spent five hours, a lot of
&gt; laughing, a little crying, and talking, with lots of
&gt; cameras and mikes on us. The controllers would not
&gt; let me take notes!
[large snip]

 
&gt; CJ has been without glasses and without his teeth for
&gt; the whole time since he was arrested. JEFF GORDON
&gt; STILL HAS CJ'S TEETH. However, his vision has
&gt; improved! He is also without proper medication for
&gt; his Tourette's. The shrink told him that the
&gt; amphetamines he had been prescribed and which were
&gt; working well would probably be stolen by the staff
&gt; anyway. CJ is very conscious of managing his
&gt; neurological condition, with coffee, sugar, fasting,
&gt; and self-control. He does complain that he was so
&gt; pleased with himself that he got through his last
&gt; rage attack without hurting himself or acting it out
&gt; that he punched a wall in celebration and hurt his
&gt; hand!

Someone should talk to Larry Dowling (the lawyer looking
out for CJ's rights) about this.  This seems to be a
violation of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).
