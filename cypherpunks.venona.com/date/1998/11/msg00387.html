&gt; 	No, I am saying that since EVERY government at one time or another
&gt; treats its citizens like roaches, it's time to radically change the nature
&gt; of it so that it basically can't be called a government any more.

The problem isn't government, it's the people who enforce the government
that abuse it.

&gt; &gt;Well actualy it's whether it has a tax stamp whether you sell it out of a
&gt; &gt;storefront or a truckbed is irrelevent. Considering the number of people wh=

&gt; 	Wanna bet?

Absolutely. I happen to know a whole passel of beer, wine, and liqour
makers. Austin as aswim in micro-breweries. I'd be more than happy to pass
your email address to the enibriated set and let them argue the point with
you.

&gt; 	Most states have fairly strict laws concerning where liquor can be
&gt; sold.

Actualy it's not the states (at least Texas and Louisiana), it's the local
cities. The state of Texas doesn't care as long as you pay your liquor
license and don't sell to minors and obey the local zoning ordinances.

Taxation: 512-463-2002

Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission

&gt; 	Which is completely irrelevant as to wheter or not it is currently
&gt; black market or not, which is the context I was working in.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Stay on target.

I am on target. The fact that a unregulated alcohol industry led to death,
debilitation, and financial hardship justified the imposition of regulation
on alcohol and its related operations.

You just don't want the entire picture painted because it cast a harsh light
on the premise that un-regulated economies are good things.

&gt; &gt;Not necessarily. The doctor has to have a medicaly supportable reason to
&gt; &gt;dispence those drugs. Otherwise it's just as black market as Joe's.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Quibble Quibble. You know EXACTLY what I meant.

Yeah, you meant to commit an act of ommission so that your position looks
more favorable than it actualy does.

&gt; &gt;Didn't think of theft? Jesus H. Christ, you gotta be on Joe's drugs. The
&gt; &gt;vast majority of material sold on *ANY* black market is stolen from its
&gt; &gt;rightful owner. It is *the* example of black market trading that most folks
&gt; &gt;think of first.
&gt; 
&gt; 	No, the vast majority (in terms of dollars) of stuff sold on the
&gt; black market is Drugs.

Really? Drugs are what $10B US a year or so. I bet stolen automobiles when
taken as a whole gross more loss than that. And what makes you think that
the vast majority of that drugs aren't purchased at the street level with
funds gotten from theft? The drugs may not be stolen, the dollar that they
were bought with was in most cases.

&gt; 	Treat theft like any other economic activity, and figure out how to
&gt; make it unprofitable.

Let me know when you figure that one out.

&gt; &gt;How the hell do you sell something on the black market if you don't have
&gt; &gt;possession of it? And exactly who is going to prosecute anyone for
&gt; 
&gt; 	Easy, it's called a Con.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Seriously tho, I said that the _selling_ of stolen goods might not
&gt; be illegal, but the possesion of such things, and the stealing of them are
&gt; seperate acts to the selling of them.

Still doesn't answer my question.

&gt; 	There isn't a need to. Shoot them.

Ah, so you admit that the general mechanism to settle inter-personal dispute
under your plan is to allow people to run around shooting each other.

Well, at least we've got an honest admission that murder would be legal in
this system.
