<PRE>

I'm currently serving a 3-year term on the Board of Trustees of the
Internet Society, and have volunteered for the nominations committee.
The board is elected by the membership; every year five or six
Trustees are elected to three-year staggered terms.  I would like to
see talented people who care about the future of society serve on the
board.  I know there are many such among the cypherpunks.  If you are
willing to serve on the Board, please nominate yourself, or if you
know someone who's willing to serve and who you think would be good,
please nominate them.  Send such nominations to isoc-noms@isoc.org.
The message below gives all the details.

Not everyone nominated will be on the ballot; the nominations
committee will winnow it to a list of ten or fifteen people.  And
among those people, only the top five vote-getters will be elected by
the membership.

Anyone who the nominations committee doesn't pick for the ballot, can
get on it anyway, if they submit a petition from 65 Internet Society
members to put their name on the ballot.  That's how I got on the
ballot when I was elected a few years ago.  (IETF is a great place to
run around and get people to sign your petition.)

Being a Trustee makes you responsible for the acts of the Internet
Society.  And you get to help decide what those acts will be.  It's an
unpaid, volunteer job.  You get to fly (at your own expense) to the
board meetings a few times a year.  ISOC has done many good things,
like training people in a hundred countries how to set up the first
Internet node there.  Like publicly stating (in RFC 1984) that it will
ignore US export controls when designing worldwide Internet crypto
protocols.  Like working hard to resolve the mess around domain-name
and IP-address administration, and the mess around the "Internet"
trademark.  ISOC also provides the organizational structure for the
IETF and the Internet Architecture Board.  ISOC will probably do many
more good things -- particularly if it has good people as Trustees!

Whether or not you want to be a Trustee, I encourage you to join the
Internet Society as a member -- see <A  HREF="http://www.isoc.org/isoc/membership/">http://www.isoc.org/isoc/membership/</A>

Attention: 1999 Nominations Committee

Nominations are to reach the committee no later than 17 December 1998 in
order to ensure due consideration of the nomination by the committee.
Nominations (in the form of agreed nominations, suggestions or volunteers)
are to include the name of the nominated individual, contact details and a
brief explanation of the basis of the nomination.

The  committee will confirm with the candidates their willingness to stand
for election as a nominated candidate if so selected. Nominees will also be
requested to provide the committee with further personal details (in the
format of a curriculum vita) as they relate to the selection guidelines
that are to be applied by the committee, and provide to the committee a
statement indicating their willingness and ability to devote an appropriate
level of time to activities associated with the position of Trustee of the
Internet Society.

It is intended that the committee's selection process will result in 10
candidates for election as nominated candidates.  This list will  be passed
to the Elections Committee on 19 December 1998, as well as informing voting
members of the Society of the selected nominees.

Additional candidates for election to the Board of Trustees may be
nominated by membership petition, filed with the Chair of the
Nominating Committee no later than 22 January 1999.  A petition for
the 1999 election will require the signatures of sixty-five voting
ISOC members (1% of the total voting members). Specific details of the
petition process will be included in the announcement of nominated
candidates on 19 December 1998.

Following the closure of the petition period, the list of the nominated and
petitioned candidates will be announced 29 January 1999.

The Election Committee will mail the ballots out to ISOC voting members on
26 February 1999 and the election date is set to be 3 May 1999.

B. Nominations Committee Selection Guidelines

Candidates for ISOC Trustee should have a demonstrable involvement in the
Internet. Such involvement may range from  participation as a technology
developer, researcher, user, network operator, policy maker (e.g. in
government), sponsor of research and development. ISOC is interested in
broadly-based representation on the Board of Trustees and seeks to identify
candidates from industry, education and non-profit sectors and from
government. The selection criteria will be directed to selecting a broad
range of interests, and will include criteria of regional location, current
activities, relevant experience and professional background.

Ten candidates will be selected by this committee, using the criteria as
outlined above.

D. Procedures for Nomination and Election of Trustees

1. Trustee Positions to be Filled

The Board of Trustees will advise the Nominating Committee of the number of
Trustee positions to be filled by vote of the individual members at each
annual election.  The Board may also advise the Nominating Committee of its
desires with respect to the backgrounds of individuals to be nominated in
order to achieve the balance of experience and qualifications required by
the provisions of By-Law Article III, Section 2, which provides that "the
Board shall seek to have among the Trustees representative individuals from
industry, from educational and nonprofit organizations and from government."

1.1  Date of Election

The Board of Trustees will annually adopt a timetable for Trustee
elections.  The election date shall be not less than 40 days prior to the
next Annual Meeting of the Society.

1.2  Use of Electronic Mail

All communications concerning the nomination and election of Trustees shall

may participate in the nomination process by postal mail or  FAX.

2.  Nominating Committee

The Board of Trustees will annually appoint a Trustee Nominating Committee.
The Nominating Committee will consist of  7 individual members of the
Society, 5 of whom shall constitute a valid quorum.  The Chair of the

2 members of the  Nominating Committee shall be individual members of the
Society  not currently serving in any elected or appointed capacity in the
Society.

2.1  Nominations by Committee

The Nominating Committee will notify the members of the Society of the

Trustees to be elected.

2.2  Nominations by Petition

The Nominating Committee will notify the voting members of the Society of
the names of individuals nominated by the committee for election to the
Board of Trustees not less than 105 days prior to the date established for
Trustee elections.  Additional nominations for election to the Board of
Trustees may be made by petition filed with the Chair of the Nominating
Committee not less than 75 days prior to the election.  Petitions may be
filed electronically.  The Nominating Committee shall specify the number of
signatures of voting members required for petitions, which shall be at
least fifty voting members of the Society, or 1% of the total number of
voting members of the Society, whichever is greater.

2.3  Candidates for Election

The Nominating Committee will provide the names of a completed slate of
candidates for election to the Elections Committee not less than 74 days
prior to the election date.

3.  Elections Committee

a Trustee whose term of office does not expire during the year of the

3.3  Voting

Each voting member will be entitled to as many votes as there are Trustee

the total number of votes available if he or she so chooses.

3.4  Receipt of Ballots

All ballots for Trustee elections shall be received by the Chair of the
Elections Committee by 5 PM local time on the day prior to the date of the
election, at the place established by the Elections Committee for delivery
of the ballots.

3.5  Counting of Ballots

The counting of ballots will take place on the election date, at a time and
place established by the Elections Committee.  At least two members of the
Elections Committee shall be present at the counting of the ballots.  The
committee will establish procedures to ensure the privacy, validity and
accuracy of all ballots.

3.6  Certification of Vote

The Elections Committee shall certify the results of the annual Trustee
election to the Board of Trustees within 10 days following the election,
forwarding a list of the candidates and the number of votes each candidate
has received.

3.7  Challenges

No challenge to any Trustee nomination or election procedure or result may
be brought except by an individual member in good standing.  Any challenge
must be addressed to the President of the Society with a recital of the
reasons for the challenge, and must be received within 20 days of the
election date.  The President, after consultation with the Chairs of the
Nominating and Elections Committees and the members of the Board of

which shall be final, within 40 days of the election date.
