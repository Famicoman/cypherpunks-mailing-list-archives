&gt; 	Usualy !=3D Correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Take tomatoes. Perfectly legal (AFAIK) everywhere, here in this
&gt; country a 5 year old child can buy a tomato from a farmer with a stand on
&gt; the side of the road.
&gt; 
&gt; 	If you go back 10 years, and if "this country" was the soviet
&gt; union, a tomato purchased from the wrong person could get you in trouble.

So what are saying...that because any government ever happened to abuse its
citizens in a particular way is justification to do away with all
government?

This is a strawman.

&gt; 	This is true in this coutry. Licquor is legal if purchased thru the
&gt; approved store.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Try selling the same thing out of the back of your truck.
&gt; 
&gt; 	It is the product, or how the product is sold.

Well actualy it's whether it has a tax stamp whether you sell it out of a
storefront or a truckbed is irrelevent. Considering the number of people who
died in the late 1800's and early 1900's because of moonshine liquor from
contaminated stills that were unregulated (where were those fine upstanding
ethical considerate eco-anarchists then?) it's probably a good thing that
it's illegal to sell untaxed and therefore anonymous alcohol.

&gt; 	So take ampthetimines (well, don't take them, but take the case of
&gt; them), if I get them from Joe Random Drug Dealer, it's black Market, if I
&gt; get them from Paul the Doctor, it's "white" market.

Not necessarily. The doctor has to have a medicaly supportable reason to
dispence those drugs. Otherwise it's just as black market as Joe's.

&gt; 	In fact, if I get them from Paul the Doctor, and then sell them to
&gt; someone else, I am selling them on the black market, even if I recieved
&gt; them legally, so in this case, it isn't how the item was aquired, it's
&gt; whether the _sale_, the *exchange* is legal.

So, we've already established this as a viable mechanism. Rehash old hash.

&gt; 	I didn't think of theft when I wrote the above, and I don't usually

Didn't think of theft? Jesus H. Christ, you gotta be on Joe's drugs. The
vast majority of material sold on *ANY* black market is stolen from its
rightful owner. It is *the* example of black market trading that most folks
think of first.

&gt; 	I still maintain that as one moves closer to a completely free
&gt; market, there is less and less of a black market, and to be the extrememe
&gt; case of a free market, there would be the potential to trade in both human
&gt; lives, and in stolen property.

Well, at least you're an honest eco-anarchist. And how do you propose to stop
this sort of behaviour (it's clear that there is a market whether the
economy is free-market or not) without some sort of 3rd party arbiter (call
it government or not is irrelevant to the point)?

&gt; In a free market, the selling of stolen
&gt; goods might not be a crime in and of itself, but the posession of those
&gt; things could be,

How the hell do you sell something on the black market if you don't have
possession of it? And exactly who is going to prosecute anyone for
possession? Since we've done away with laws governing economics and trade
there isn't even a court to try the perps in if we did apprehend them
ourselves.

 and the aquireing would be, as well, the _hiring_ of an
&gt; assassin might be legal, as long as no killing took place. When it does,
&gt; you hang the assassin on murder, and the hirer on conspiracy, aiding and
&gt; abetting or whatever, and stick them in the same cell.

Huh? Who is doing all this arresting and writing of laws, and building
jails, and staffing prisons, or hiring hangmen?

We're not in Kansas anymore toto....
