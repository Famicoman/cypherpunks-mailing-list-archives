========== forwarded from the Canadian Firearms Digest, V2 #701 ========<BR>
Date: Sun, 15 Nov 1998 15:23:49 -0600<BR>
From: Marstar &lt;<FONT COLOR=0000ff><U>marstar@hawk.igs.net<FONT COLOR=000000 DEFAULT="COLOR"></U>&gt;<BR>
Subject: Re: Cdn-Firearms Digest V2 #699<BR>
<BR>
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY TWO CENTS WORTH, THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE<BR>
SUBJECT WITH US....<BR>
<BR>
1. Ask to see the search warrant.<BR>
NFA: The searchers are required to SHOW you a COPY of the warrant or<BR>
TELL you what is in it before executing it, and LEAVE you a copy of it<BR>
when they leave..<BR>
<BR>
100% RIGHT, BUT WHEN THE PERSON POINTING THE MP-5 AT YOU TELLS YOU<BR>
TO SHUT-UP AND MOVE AWAY, WHAT WOULD SUGGEST ??<BR>
<BR>
2. Ask the person in possession of the warrant to identify himself and<BR>
all of those with him and to indicate whether those persons are<BR>
authorized to aid in the execution of the warrant.<BR>
<BR>
WITH 40 PEOPLE ALREADY TEARING THINGS APART AND AN ENTIRE SWAT<BR>
TEAM ON HAND HOLDING YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYEES AT GUNPOINT, THEY REFUSE TO<BR>
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES, HOW SHOULD WE IMPRESS THEM WITH OUR DEMANDS ??<BR>
<BR>
TO ADD A BIT OF CHALLENGE TO THE AFFAIR MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE IN<BR>
CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND WORE NO ID....MOST OF THE TRUCK AND CARS WERE<BR>
UNMARKED.... HAD WE NOT TAKEN PICTURES WE WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW WHO HAD<BR>
"VISITED" US.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3. Request time to review the warrant and to obtain advice with<BR>
respect to the appropriate course of conduct.<BR>
<BR>
EXCELLENT IDEA, WHEN I REACHED FOR THE PHONE TO CALL OUR LAWYER<BR>
TWO OF THE SWAT TEAM SMEMBERS WITH MP-5s POINTED AT ME INSTRUCTED ME "TO<BR>
GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THE PHONE" THE FACT THAT I TOLD THEM I WANTETO<BR>
CALL MY LAWYER DID NOT SEEM TO IMPRESS THAT AT ALL....<BR>
<BR>
AS FOR HAVING TIME TO REVIEW THE WARRANT, THEY DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN<BR>
HEARING ANY ARGUMENTS ON THE SUBJECT....<BR>
<BR>
IS THERE SOME OTHER APPROACH I SHOULD HAVE USED ??<BR>
<BR>
4. Read the warrant carefully to determine: the premises covered<BR>
<BR>
WE ADVISED THE OFFICER IN CHARGE THAT THIS WAS INCORRECT...."NOT<BR>
IMPORTANT" WAS THE REPLY<BR>
<BR>
the specific documents or objects it covers<BR>
<BR>
WE ALSO ADVISED THEM OF THE ERRORS IN THIS SECTION...."IT DOES NOT<BR>
MATTER" REPLIED THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE RAID....<BR>
<BR>
 the alleged offence(s) subject of the warrant<BR>
<BR>
NEW:  Read the DATE and TIMES that the warrant authorizes search. <BR>
<BR>
THESE POINTS WERE CORRECT....<BR>
<BR>
Often, the warrant is invalid because they were supposed to do the<BR>
search YESTERDAY, or EARLIER TODAY, and entry can then be legally<BR>
refused.  CC s.  488 forbids the execution of a search warrant AT<BR>
NIGHT, unless "(a) the justice [who issues it] is satisfied that there<BR>
are reasonable grounds for it to be executed by night, (b) the<BR>
reasonable grounds are included in the Information [laid before the<BR>
justice to get the warrant], AND (c) the warrant authorizes that it be<BR>
executed by night."<BR>
<BR>
5. At the same time that the warrant is being reviewed, instruct<BR>
someone to make the following calls (if not already made):<BR>
legal counsel <BR>
<BR>
I INDICATED ABOVE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE<BR>
ATTEMPTED TO USE THE PHONE, WE WERE SOME TIME INTO THE SEARCH BEFORE MY<BR>
WIFE WAS ABLE TO CALL OUR LAWYER....<BR>
<BR>
individuals named in the warrant whose offices are to be searched<BR>
each should be advised that the search is pending and cautioned<BR>
that they must not remove, alter or destroy any documents or other material<BR>
in their offices.<BR>
<BR>
HEY THAT MANY PEOPLE CARRYING SUB MACHINE GUNS,<BR>
SHOTGUNS, STUN GRENADES, HANDGUNS, ETC, ETC....HAVE MY INSTANT OBEDIENCE<BR>
ASSURED....<BR>
&gt;NFA: ADD the local news media<BR>
<BR>
GOOD LUCK, IN OUR CASE THEY CLOSED OFF OUR ROADWAY AND TURNED AWAY<BR>
EVERYBODY WHO SHOWED UP....<BR>
FEW PEOPLE APPRECIATE THE "HOSPITALITY" OF ARMED POLICE AT YOU GATE....<BR>
<BR>
&gt;NFA: ADD NFA HQ: (403)439-1394 or NFA- (add prov.branch # here<BR>
<BR>
WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT THE NFA FOR SEVERAL HOURS....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;NFA NOTE:  If told that you must sit down and not use the phone, ask:<BR>
"Am I under arrest?"  If the answer is "No, not YET!" then no one has<BR>
any right to TOUCH you, or to hinder your use of the telephone. <BR>
<BR>
WE TRIED THAT APPROACH BUT I'M A CHICKEN AT HEART, TWO MP-5s<BR>
POINTED AT MY MID-SECTION MADE ME THAT WAY....<BR>
<BR>
 If an officer DOES touch you, then ask again: "Am I under arrest?"  If<BR>
the answer is no, then say:  "In that case, take your hand off me -- or I<BR>
will arrest YOU for assault."  [Yes, you ARE authorized to do that by<BR>
Canadian law, CC s. 494(1) and (3)].<BR>
<BR>
6. Do not "agree" that the search can be expanded beyond the limits<BR>
described in the warrant. <BR>
<BR>
IN OUR CASE THEY DID ABSOLUTELY AS THEY PLEASED, THEY HAD GUNS AND<BR>
WE DID NOT....<BR>
<BR>
7. Do not answer any substantive questions.<BR>
NFA: More people are convicted from what they SAY than from any other<BR>
cause.  You have a right to SILENCE.  USE IT.  Unless you know as much<BR>
about firearms law as the NFA does, you have NO IDEA whether or not<BR>
you ARE guilty - -- because you may SEEM to be guilty, and yet the NFA<BR>
can often tell your lawyer why you are NOT.  <BR>
<BR>
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT....<BR>
<BR>
8. Do not attempt to impede, physically or ot otherwise, the person<BR>
executing the warrant.  NFA: That is obstruction, and a criminal offence.<BR>
<BR>
AND IF YOU HAVE A PUMPED UP BUNCH OF PEOPLE CARRYING AUTOMATIC<BR>
WEAPONS WITH FINGERS ON THE TRIGGER DON'T EVEN THINK OF GIVING THEM A<BR>
PROBLEM.... THESE PEOPLE WILL SHOOT FIRST AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER....THEY<BR>
PROVED THAT ON A NUMBER OF RAIDS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS....<BR>
<BR>
9. If any documents exist in respect of which solicitor-client<BR>
privilege may exist, identify the documents and their location and<BR>
indicate to the search officer that the documents are subject to<BR>
solicitor-client privilege and that you require that the appropriate<BR>
procedures be followed to protect the privilege.<BR>
<BR>
OH YEAH, THAT IS GAURANTEED TO IMPRESS THEM, HELL WE EVEN HAVE<BR>
PICTURES OF AN OFFICER STEALING DOCUMENTS....<BR>
<BR>
10. Keep an accurate log (or copy) of all documents seized.   NFA: the<BR>
searchers are required to file an "Information" with the court to get<BR>
a search warrant.  Unless the justice blocks it, the "Information" is<BR>
a public document. After executing the warrant, the searchers must<BR>
file a "Return" with the court, explaining what they did with the<BR>
warrant and listing what they took.  SO: After being searched, go to<BR>
the court that issued the warrant and request a copy of the<BR>
Information and Return relating to that warrant.  You should be able<BR>
to get them for the cost of photocopying, and they are VALUABLE.<BR>
<BR>
IN OUR CASE THEY SEALED THE WARRANT THEREBY DENYING ACCESS TO ALL<BR>
WHO ASKED.... <BR>
<BR>
THEY WILL GIVE YOU WHATEVER RECEIPTS THEY FEEL LIKE GIVING YOU....WHEN<BR>
THEY PLEASE....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS ACCURATE AND A MATTER OF COURT RECORD.<BR>
WE CHALLENGED THE WARRANTS AND THEY WERE DECLARED ILLEGAL....<BR>
WE CHALLENGED THE RAID UNDER TWO SECTIONS OF THE CANADIAN CHARTER, WE<BR>
WON....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS "DON'T EXPECT THINGS TO GO DOWN IN A<BR>
SMOOTH AND ORGANIZED MANNER, THEIR PEOPLE ARE RUNNING ON ADRENALIN, YOU<BR>
ARE UPSET AND NERVOUS, THE HEAD MAN IS TRYING TO IMPRESS HIS MEN,<BR>
DON'T BE A HERO, DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID, LIVE TO FIGHT<BR>
ANOTHER DAY.<BR>
<BR>
SORRY FOR DRAGGING ON BUT EVEN AFTER 3.1/2 YEARS THIS EVENT STILL HAS ME<BR>
FURIOUS.<BR>
<BR>
