&gt;&gt; Anyway, were I to try to shield a laptop I'd start with microwave leakage
&gt;&gt; meters, a couple of t.v.s and radio (of different types and bands), and
&gt;&gt; then I'd start recording signal levels of various sorts as different
&gt;&gt; shielding layers and types were applied to the laptop(s). Simple lab stuff.

&gt;
&gt;	As someone who has actually spent hellish weeks working to
&gt;suppress the RF emissions of some commericial network gear I designed -
&gt;to make it pass FCC B and VDE certification - let me say this is a black
&gt;art and no fun.  There are sophisticated electromagnetics programs that
&gt;can sometimes succeed in modeling the radiation from a computer system,
&gt;but they are very expensive and inputting all the required information
&gt;is painful or downright impossible (data just not available or in a
&gt;usable format), so this nasty job usually gets done seat of the pants
&gt;style using rules of thumb and educated guesses and hard won experiance
&gt;and lots of trial and error.  The job consists of attaching lossy
&gt;ferrite beads, copper tape and other RF and common mode current supressing
&gt;devices, shielding plastic packages with spray metallic coatings, adding
...

All good points, but there's a big difference between trying to meet FCC
emissions requirements for a commercial product that has to meet cost,
weight, and cosmetic requirements (e.g., a plastic case!), and the scenario
of making a TEMPEST-like box for a laptop. Ferrite beads and copper tape
are a lot different from a sealed box made of 10-gauge copper sheet.

&gt;	Nobody does this using ordinary radios and TVs, the standard
&gt;tool is a broadband spectrum analyzer or special EMC receiver with
&gt;quasipeak filters and special calibrated wideband dipole antennas that
&gt;have known gain and pattern characteristics.  Isolating of radiating
&gt;sites is often done with near field probes or sniffers attached to the
&gt;spectrum analyzer that allow hot spots to be tracked to within a few cm.
&gt;Often in order to get enough sensitivity one also needs special
&gt;preamps, and a RF quiet site where signals from the DUT aren't drowned
&gt;out by pagers and cellphones and emissions from nearby computers.   A
&gt;good bit of this work is done way out in the country under non-metallic
&gt;fiberglass buildings that don't create reflections that confuse the
&gt;measurements.   And conducted as opposed to radiated noise is measured
&gt;with special power line filters and cable filters...

Sure, but my point was that John Young should *at least* start with actual
measurements, as opposed to putting most of the onus on a FOIA request to
get TEMPEST docs declassified.

If he can get spectrum analyzers and all that stuff, so much the better.
