&gt;
&gt;I find very little interference in my daily life as well (except when one of
&gt;you anarcho-cooks starts dropping bombs and threatening people).

&gt;&gt; 	Crap. They take 60+ percent of your income in taxes, that means
&gt;&gt; that they take 60+ percent of your working day.
&gt;They take 40% of my income, or are you talking of France taking 60% of your
&gt;income. Disagreement over the level or specific policies for spending it do
&gt;not justify eliminating the system.

	Specific levels maybe, but spending policies, yes it does.

&gt;&gt; 	They (at least france) throw up HUGE barriers to anyone wanting to
&gt;&gt; start a business, especially if they will need to hire workers. This not
&gt;&gt; only makes it difficult for you to start a business (which would never
&gt;&gt; happen since you've indicated you like someone else making decisions for
&gt;&gt; you) but also increases unemployment (prevents others from creating jobs
&gt;&gt; rather than just begging for them).
&gt;
&gt;And you find that a better place to live then the US?

	Again, That was Franco, I live in the US, and wrote that part.

&gt;
&gt;What is the percentage of lawyers in France to the total population?
&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 	So, the fact that it hasn't been tried in 4000 years means it will
&gt;&gt; never work?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 	I guess it's a good thing the wright brothers didn't take that
&gt;&gt; attitude, nor Robert Goddard.
&gt;
&gt;We tried anarchy, it's called cave men. As to Wright and Goddard, they had
&gt;ample evidence in physics (that's been around what 4.5B years) to build
&gt;their expectations on. In the field of politics and social system the only
&gt;thing we have to go with is our imagination, patience, understanding, and
&gt;past practice. 5k years or a little more.
&gt;
&gt;All of those say anarcho-anything systems won't work.

	Those haven't been tried in 5 or 6k years, things change.
