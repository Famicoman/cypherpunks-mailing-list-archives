Is there some specific reason they need to be large scale or long lasting?&nbsp;
By definition, anarcho-capitalism is constantly changing -- perhaps as
much as between extreme individualism, to the current state of feudalism
that has pervaded the world since the birth of agrarianism.
<P>I agree with you that most utopianist ranting here carries a strong
whiff of frustration and steam venting.&nbsp; To those anarcho-capitalists,
I recommend the course of action I took 25 years ago.&nbsp; If you don't
like the state you live in, don't patronize it.&nbsp; There are many save
harbors in the world that better approach your ideals, and are more amenable
to change, than the Union of Socialist Americans.
