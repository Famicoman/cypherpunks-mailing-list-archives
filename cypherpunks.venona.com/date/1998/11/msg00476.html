&gt;Becos the attempted paraody was lame in the same ways that all attempts to
&gt;nonrationally support 2nd amendment freedoms by calling down the gods of 1st
&gt;amendment freeomds always are nonrational. (And no, that's not me saying
&gt;supporting 2nd amendment freedoms is irrational; it's me saying using the
&gt;1st amendment to do so is irrational).

Let's try this again.

Notice how, in each of the amendments below, the 1st is the only one with
the text "congress shall make no law".

This is implied, understood to be implied, accepted as implied and supreme
court ruled to be implied as applicable to each of the rest of the bill of
rights, and later to the amendments, wherein it is not so specified as in
the 1st.

A large part of the reason that 2 thru 10 and the rest do not include that
phrase is to prevent the states from doing the very thing that congress was
and is prohibited from.

Congress cannot pass any law that would infringe freedom of speech, they
cannot cause the states by threat or incentive to pass such laws either-
say by withholding highway maintenance funding a la 55.

Arbitrary out of context interpretations of documents such as this are just
that. I grant you no brownie points for comprehension, you may have earned
some demerits for instigating a straw man.

Go to the back of the class.

Reeza!
