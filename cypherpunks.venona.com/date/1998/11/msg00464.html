&gt; &gt; The Constitution happens to mention that the federal government is detailed
&gt; &gt; with taking care of the general welfare. If you don't like that sort of stuff
&gt; &gt; then get a Constitutional amendment passed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Wow.  He said it.  This proves that Jim hasn't really read any history
&gt; since public high school.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually this is the central fallacy of those that haven't bothered to
&gt; actually read the federalist papers, the anti-federalist papers or the
&gt; constitution, much less say how it should be amended. 
&gt; 
&gt; If a constitutional amendment had to have been passed it would have been
&gt; to give the federal government unlimited power to do what they believe is
&gt; in the interests of our general welfare.   Madison explicitly addressed
&gt; the issue of unlimited federal power emanating from the welfare clause.
&gt; 
&gt; Had the supreme court bothered to read the founder's writings on this
&gt; they would have found it in a week or two.  That's assuming their
&gt; conclusion was not already decided.
&gt; 
&gt; The constitution is a document that enumerates the powers of the federal
&gt; government.  It is very specific.  As Madison stated, if the general
&gt; welfare clause meant what the socialist engineers wished it meant, there
&gt; would have been no need to enumerate the specific powers of the federal
&gt; government.  In fact, it would have been as if the founding fathers had
&gt; said: 
&gt; 
&gt; "The federal government has unlimited power to do whatever it
&gt; feels necessary."
&gt; 
&gt; "The powers of the federal government are as follows"
&gt; 
&gt; (1) 
&gt; (2)
&gt; (3) etc
&gt; 
&gt; Which would be ridiculous on its face.
&gt; 
&gt; The reality of the situation is that Roosevelt kept trying to stack the
&gt; Supreme Court.  He eventually suceeded in appointing his socialist
&gt; crony judges to "reinterpret" the constitution.  The first result
&gt; of this was that Social (in)Security was ruled constitutional because
&gt; it was in "the general welfare".
&gt; 
&gt; This was probably the last nail in the coffin of the Republic.  The first
&gt; nail was imposing huge export duties on cotton in order to limit demand
&gt; outside the country -- in effect driving down cotton prices so it could be
&gt; had cheaply by the northern industrial (clothing/textile) markets. 
&gt; Southern states saw this as blatant price controls.  In their inability to
&gt; change the taxes they sought to leave the union.  A prime example of the
&gt; old adage -- "the power to tax is the power to destroy".  In this case it
&gt; was destroying the union itself.  Only after the war was on did the north
&gt; use the anti-slavery propaganda to peddle their cause.  And use it to good
&gt; advantage they did.  I'm glad the slaves were emancipated, but I wish
&gt; it were done with less blood and more foresight.
&gt; 
&gt; Bear in mind that as a libertarian I view slavery as one of the ultimate
&gt; evils.  However, the northern industrialists had no leg to stand on
&gt; because they were one of the prime beneficiaries of cheap labor and thus
&gt; cheap cotton prices during the era of westward expansion.  Never mind that
&gt; only the wealthy in the south owned slaves.  If that was so, why was the
&gt; opposition to the feds so virulent? 
&gt; 
&gt; By 1913, Jekyl Island was a done deal.  The income tax and the federal
&gt; reserve banking system were unleashed.  A concise discussion of this is
&gt; beyond the scope of this posting.  Needless to say centralized federal
&gt; power was on the move.  The system of institutionalized fiat currency was
&gt; one of the main causes of the 1929 crash that put Roosevelt in power.  It
&gt; was that "government breaks your leg, government hands you a crutch,
&gt; government becomes savior"  mentality that resulted in the endless cycle
&gt; of market distortions and power grabs that put us where we are now. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean that Roosevelt was "evil".  No.  Just that, as one
&gt; playwrite once said, "the conflict of good against good is much more
&gt; interesting".  Well-intentioned "good people" have contributed more to the
&gt; misery of the human race that any other factor alone.  I'm sure that
&gt; Roosevelt felt he was doing "good" when he undid the Republic.  His
&gt; crowning achievment was his stacking of the Supreme Court and the
&gt; resulting unlimited expansion of federal power.  If this country survives
&gt; Y2K it will have to contend with the issue that the scope of the federal
&gt; government's power is not unlimited.  Something has got to give.  Y2K
&gt; seems as likely a bifurcation and surfaction point as any. 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Hettinga is right.  Economics, like physics obeys the "reality is
&gt; not an option" rule.  When centralized bureacracy becomes too expensive
&gt; the invisible hand will select something more efficient.
