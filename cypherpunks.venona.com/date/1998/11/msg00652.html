[If you know of people who may be interested in this meeting, please
feel free to forward this message to them.]

The next luncheon meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of New
York (DCS-NY), will be held on Tuesday, December 15th at 12:00. If you
are interested in attending, please RSVP and send in your check (as
explained below) as soon as possible. [Note: This month, DCS-NY will
be on the third Tuesday of the month, not the second, because of
scheduling conflicts.]

This Month's Luncheon Talk:

	        Does Internet Commerce Really Need a PKI?
			        Win Treese
		       Corporate Systems Architect
			    Open Market, Inc.
			  treese@openmarket.com

  It is now commonplace to claim that a "good PKI" [Public Key
  Infrastructure] is the technology that will enable the widespread
  growth of Internet commerce. But what does Internet commerce need
  from a PKI? Based on our experiences with many kinds of businesses,
  we will examine some of the real-world security requirements and how
  public-key systems may be appropriate or inappropriate solutions to
  those problems.

  Win Treese is Corporate Systems Architect at Open Market, Inc.,
  (<A  HREF="http://www.openmarket.com">http://www.openmarket.com</A>) a leading vendor of software for Internet
  commerce. At Open Market, he has worked on many different products
  and systems, with a particular focus on security for commerce applications.
  He has previously worked at Digital Equipment Corporation's Cambridge
  Research Lab and at MIT's Project Athena. He is co-author of the book
  "Designing Systems for Internet Commerce" (<A  HREF="http://www.treese.org/Commerce">http://www.treese.org/Commerce</A>).
  In addition, he chairs the IETF Working Group on Transport Layer
  Security (TLS), and is program chair for the 8th USENIX Security Symposium
  (<A  HREF="http://www.usenix.org/events/sec99/">http://www.usenix.org/events/sec99/</A>).


WHAT IS DCS-NY?

The Digital Commerce Society of New York (DCS-NY) is a spin-off of
DCS-Boston (DCSB).  We meet once a month for lunch at the Harvard Club
of New York -- usually on the second Tuesday of the month -- to
explore the implications of rapidly emerging internet and
cryptographic technologies on finance and commerce.

If you are interested in attending our next luncheon meeting, please
follow the directions located below. If you merely wish to be added to
our e-mail meeting announcements list, you may send your e-mail
address to "dcs-ny-rsvp@piermont.com".
