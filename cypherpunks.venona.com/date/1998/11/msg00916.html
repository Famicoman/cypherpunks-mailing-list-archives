&gt; Subject: Re: How to reign the federal government in...

&gt; As per Article V, two thirds of the States can call a Convention to
&gt; propose Amendments. I believe this would be 33 of our current 50 states. 
&gt; Territories and other holding would have no say in this.  At this point,
&gt; if three fourths of the states agree to any proposed Amendments, it becomes
&gt; the law of the land.
&gt; 
&gt; We only need two thirds of the States to start the process, but this
&gt; must be done by their Legislatures.

Which is exactly what I said. The goal of the party would be to get proposed
amendments on the floor each state legislature for vote.

&gt; &gt; The IRS, for example, could be shut down tomorrow or significantly modified
&gt; &gt; via this mechanism without involvement at the federal level.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume this would be either by nullifying Amendment 15 or modifying it
&gt; to a great degree.  Nothing else would work.

That's the way I see it as well, which is the point after all. 

&gt; &gt; What is needed is a political party that has a representative site in each
&gt; &gt; state capital. Their job is to get proposed amendments to the Constitution
&gt; &gt; on the floor of each body for vote.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, it would not be to get the proposed amendments on the floor. You
&gt; would be putting the proposal for a Convention to amend the Constitution
&gt; on the floor.  In addition, depending on the State, the party would likely
&gt; need to have a member elected to that States Legislature.

Actualy it is. The Convention is only to create the amendment, the actual
vote takes place in the state legislatures, not the convention.

&gt; That is why Article V was written as it was.  It provides a backdoor to
&gt; keep the federal government from getting out of control.

Absolutely. Now, let's kick the beggar in!
