Hello fellow Privacy Seeker,

Sorry, it took a little longer to respond, as I just came back from my trip to Central America. I made the first deliveries, and both programs run very well. As we are getting into the christmas season things are getting somewhat busy. Please read below all additional expalanations and act accordingly.

2. What is extra?
Gua: name change 3000, naturalization papers 1500
Nica: name change 2000, naturalization papers 1000

3. Special features:
Holders are entitled to naturalization in Spain after only two years' residency. This is valid for both countries.

4. Discounts available?

As this is already a real bargain and is addressed to agents only, I will grant a 15% on orders of 2 or more GIVEN AT THE SAME TIME.

If you opt for name change, I do not need a copy of your current passport!

Nica:

same as above, except the following changes:

If you opt for name change, I do not need a copy of your current passport!

7. Misc:

THESE ARE NOT CHEAP FAKES!! This deal is possible based on long lasting personal relationships and donations to political groups. There is no intermediary in between, I do it myself!!

P.S.: Last, but not least: Don't get fooled by cheap imitators, I saw what they deliver, and it is just not worth the paper it was printed on, at some back yard printer shop in Guatemala City! Stay with the person whom you can trust if it comes to passports, I know the ropes of this business better than anybody else!
