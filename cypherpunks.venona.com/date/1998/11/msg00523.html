Subject: Rememberance Day 1998.<BR>
<BR>
It is past eleven  O'clock here. It is November 11th, 1998.  On this<BR>
date every year<BR>
my mind always returns to thoughts of  my uncle, whose body, it's<BR>
elements long ago<BR>
 returned to the earth, the dust undisturbed in a European grave, the<BR>
man for whom I was<BR>
renamed when the sad news reached my mother and grandfather on that<BR>
early spring<BR>
morning many years ago. Even as child their wet faces impacted me,<BR>
forever.<BR>
<BR>
It drifted today to Ottawa,  where I once stood cold but proud close to<BR>
one Paul Hellyer, then Minister of National Defense under the Honorable<BR>
Prime Minister  Lester Bowles  Pearson.<BR>
It was Rememberance Day, Paul was delivering the obligatory service<BR>
beside a Cenotaph,<BR>
the soldiers, sailors and airmen stood at ease waiting for the<BR>
ceremonies to end,<BR>
pretending to listen to his resonant,  educated voice. It was a bitter<BR>
cold day,<BR>
I knew they would prefer to be at their homes, or in their messes or<BR>
just anyplace but on parade that day.<BR>
<BR>
I was proud to be associated with a government, indeed a country even,<BR>
with such diversity, such room for individuals to work, play and<BR>
overcome the challenges each would experience. It honestly was a Free<BR>
Canada, individuals could aspire to whatever their imaginations deemed<BR>
them worthy to become.<BR>
<BR>
Later that evening, at a Military function, a member of the RCAF<BR>
suggested to me, each of us with the government issued glass in the<BR>
right hand, white serviette properly wrapped around it to keep the hand<BR>
warm and dry for handshaking, that someday he expected I would be<BR>
Minister of National Defense.  Sadly enough, we both believed it.<BR>
<BR>
But today is November 11th, 1998, at about 11:50 AM.  My pride in the<BR>
Liberal Party of Canada has been shattered.  My belief that issues like<BR>
Conscription, which polarized our founding peoples for two generations,<BR>
would never surface, ever again, gone.   My belief that MY PARTY stood<BR>
for individual rights, the only force that would stand between the<BR>
Elite's and the common person, gone. Forever.  So it a doubly sad day<BR>
for me.  My uncle, and my Party. <BR>
<BR>
Bill C68 has intruded into the lives of so many Canadians, and if left<BR>
to stand as is, will undermine everything I stood there that cold Ottawa<BR>
morning to pay tribute, and everything my uncle died for in that foreign<BR>
field so long ago. He died with no idea the rifle he carried to fight<BR>
for our freedoms would become such a divisive symbol a few short years<BR>
later.<BR>
<BR>
On this morning I shall not revisit the implications of C68. Rather, I<BR>
will ask those struggling to preserve out heritage to continue the<BR>
fight.  Do not surrender.<BR>
<BR>
Then, when it becomes our time to let our earthly possessions go, when<BR>
our bodies begin<BR>
the journey back to the dust from whence they came and our spirits<BR>
return to source, <BR>
perhaps the cold white silk of the casket or the sides of the urn<BR>
holding our ashes will be a bit warmer knowing we did all we could for<BR>
those who follow.<BR>
<BR>
Anything less of us would be shameful.<FONT COLOR=000000 DEFAULT="COLOR"><BR>
