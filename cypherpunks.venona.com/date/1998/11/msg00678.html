If anonymous has any evidence that TIS' policy has changed from earlier
this year, I'd like to hear it.

I guess if anonymous wants to call me an "extremist," I'll take it as a
compliment. Personally I think of myself as pragmatic.

&gt;
&gt;Two problems here.  First, you are using the present tense in saying that
&gt;TIS "supports" export controls, but your article is from nine months ago.
&gt;There have been many changes since then, including loosening of the crypto
&gt;export rules, the acquisition of TIS by Network Associates, and a recent
&gt;statement that TIS has backed off from its leadership role in advocating
&gt;key recovery.  What is TIS's current policy?  It certainly sounds like
&gt;it is changing.  You should find out before claiming to know what it is.
&gt;
&gt;Second, even in the context of last February, what you wrote is:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some of the firms selected also endorse restrictions. Trusted Information 
&gt;&gt; Systems recently circulated a policy paper calling for "sensible" 
&gt;&gt; legislation to "make the export of 56-bit current interim DES controls 
&gt;&gt; permanent and permit the export of stronger encryption when it is combined 
&gt;&gt; with a key recovery system." (Which, coincidentally, TIS is happy to sell 
&gt;&gt; you...)
&gt;
&gt;At the time, this would have represented a LIBERALIZATION of export laws.
&gt;56 bit exports were only allowed in the context of a promise to add key
&gt;recovery even for 56 bit keys.  The statement you have quoted calls for
&gt;allowing 56 bit key export permanently, and only requiring key recovery
&gt;for stronger encryption.  True, it was not a call for full elimination
&gt;of restrictions, but it was a step in the right direction.
&gt;
&gt;You are falling into the tiresome pattern of extremists who claim that
&gt;moderates are lackeys for the other side.  It's like an anti-abortion
&gt;fanatic who says that those who oppose murdering abortion doctors are
&gt;baby killers.  Try reporting the facts instead of altering them to fit
&gt;your biased views.
