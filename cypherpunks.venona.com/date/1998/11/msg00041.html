The DoD DNA Registry and DoD Specimen Repository for Remains
Identification

<A  HREF="http://www.afip.org/homes/oafme/dna/afdil.html">http://www.afip.org/homes/oafme/dna/afdil.html</A>

Historical Overview:

The U.S. military recognized the value of DNA testing as a necessary adjunct
to traditional identification efforts. In a memorandum dated December 16,
1991, the Deputy Secretary of Defense authorized the Assistant Secretary of
Defense (Health Affairs) to establish policies and requirements for the use
of DNA analysis in the identification of remains. To carry out these
policies, the establishment of a DNA Registry, to include a Specimen
Repository for Remains Identification and a DNA Identification Laboratory
were authorized under the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner
(OAFME). On January 5, 1993, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
Affairs) issued a policy guidance for the establishment of a repository of
specimen samples to aid in the remains identification using genetic
analysis. On May 17, 1993, the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, was delegated as
Executive Agent for the DNA Registry. On March 9, 1994, the Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) issued a Memorandum of Instruction to
the Service Secretaries establishing policies and procedures for the
collection of DNA specimens. On April 2, 1996 policy refinements were issued
to the DoD DNA Registry. In October 1994 the DNA Registry received approval
from the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors for the production
of DNA proficiency tests used by forensic DNA laboratories. AFDIL is one of
four DNA laboratories to receive this approval in the United States.

In January 1995 the Defense Science Board concurred with the use of
mitochondrial DNA testing for associated and unassociated remains. Although
AFDIL is capable of conducting more common nuclear DNA testing, nuclear DNA
testing is not possible on ancient remains.


DoD Specimen Repository for Remains Identification

The DoD DNA Specimen Repository provides reference material for DNA analysis
to assist in the remains identification process. A dried bloodstain and
buccal swab are being collected from all Active Component (AC) personnel. A
total of three DNA specimens are collected. One bloodstain card is stored in
a pouch in the service member's medical record; another bloodstain card and
a buccal swab are stored at the Armed Forces Repository for Specimen Samples
for the Identification of Remains. The blood is placed on special cards with
the service member's Social Security number, date of birth, and branch of
service designated on the front side of the card. On the reverse side of the
bloodstain card are a fingerprint, a bar code, and signature attesting to
the validity of the sample. Ultimately, the bloodstain card is stored in a
vacuum-sealed barrier bag and frozen at -20 degrees Celsius, in the Specimen
Repository. The oral swab (buccal scrapping) is fixed in isopropanol and
stored at room temperature. Great care is taken to prevent the possibility
of error from sample switching or mislabeling. Additionally, the specimens
are considered confidential medical information, and military regulations
and federal law exist to cover any issues on privacy concerns. As of
December 1994, DNA collections were being made from all newly accessioned
personnel, the residual AC members, and select high risk Reserve Component
(RC) members. Large scale RC collection are scheduled to begin collection in
FY 96. Collections are being made from any service member deployed to a
hostile fire or imminent danger area. During CY 94, collections were made
from personnel deploying to Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Bosnia, and Latin
America. All services are at least 90% complete with collections of special
operations, aviation, and high risk duty personnel. The remaining AC
individuals will be collected through FY 98, at the time of their annual
physical.

As of 31 December 1995, the Repository has received 1.15 million DNA
specimens. Specimens come into the Repository at the rate of 3,000 - 4,000
per day. The updated Specimen Management System (SMS), using the Defense
Eligibility Enrollment System (DEERS) database, verifies service member
information. In CY 95, the Repository established an on-line datalink with
DEERS. All DNA specimens will be maintained for fifty years, before being
destroyed. Individual specimen samples will be destroyed upon request of the
donor following the conclusion of the donor's complete military service
obligation (including individually ready reserve status or subject to active
duty recall) or other applicable relationship to DoD.

Primary casualty identification is fundamental to the elements of
medicolegal death investigations and involves the use of one or more
complementary methods including fingerprints, footprints, dental
comparisons, DNA identifications and superimposable radiographic techniques.
The duplicate dental panograph repository or Central Panograph Storage
Facility (CPSF) in Monterey, California was established in 1986 and has been
used more than 1000 times over the last ten years largely by DoD agencies
with close to 100 percent success. In 1991, DoD embarked on the creation and
implementation of a DNA Registry including the Armed Forces Repository of
Specimen Samples for Identification of Remains and Armed Forces Casualty
Identification Laboratory both of which are components of the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology (AFIP). The Repository accessions approximately 5,000
files/day with original plans of having all servicemembers (active, reserve
and guard) on file by FY 2002. Comparative DNA casualty identification is
now the DoD preferred standard of positive casualty identification, making
the duplicate panograph obsolete.

The CPSF will be discontinued on 31 December 1999. Therefore, I request that
you take all necessary measures to ensure an accelerated acquisitions
program of servicemember DNA specimens to include active, reserve and guard
components for purposes of casualty DNA profile identification. A DNA sample
should be obtained from all new accessions; duplicate panographs will not be
taken on new accessions and no servicemember is to deploy without having a
DNA specimen on file. The DEERS Data Bank shall be used to ensure that
servicemembers do in fact have a DNA specimen on file. While updated
radiographs will continue to be part of a servicemember's medical/dental
record, no new radiographs will be received by the Repository, effective
this date.

Please provide me with a copy of your plan to implement this accelerated
request by 23 August 1996. The point of contact for this action is Captain
Glenn Wagner, Deputy Director, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, (202)
782-2103. Colonel Salvatore M. Cirone is the OASD(HA) point of contact,
(703) 695-7116.

 "Parents will feel more secure knowing they have their child's
 DNA 'fingerprints' safely stored away."

    - Dr. Martin H. Smith, Pediatrician and former President of
      the American Academy of Pediatrics


DNA I.D. is, without question, the future of identification. For one thing,
DNA I.D. (also known as "genetic fingerprinting") is the only virtually
positive and permanent identification method. For example, photographs fade
and must be updated, and fingerprints can smear or be difficult to acquire
(getting a proper child's fingerprint can be very difficult), but each
person's DNA does not change for his entire life. DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) molecules are that part of the human physiology which carries the
genetic "blueprint" that makes each person unique. Each person's "genetic"
makeup is exclusive and never changes for their entire life. As such, "DNA
fingerprinting" can provide reliable identification even when it may be
impossible to recover a fingerprint. Further, DNA I.D. is generally
admissible in court, and can be invaluable in reuniting parents with their
children in the case of parental abductions, kidnappings, accidents, and
natural disasters.

DNA identification is now available to families in an easy-to-use, at-home
kit. With the "do-it-yourself" DNA I.D.Kit, it takes parents only minutes to
capture, preserve, and store-at-home their child's genetic "fingerprints."
Tens of thousands of parents are already keeping their children's "genes" at
home. The DNA I.D. Kit provides a way of properly taking, recording, and
storing genetic samples in a patented, tamper-proof system.

Yello Dyno says "O.K., this is where you might get a little 'squeemish,' but
read on, because this is really cool and easy ... and something every parent
needs to consider for their child (or any member of their family, for that
matter!). This is how it works."

The genetic material is derived from very small samples hair and blood. The
kit includes a virtually painless, spring-loaded, medical quality puncture
tool to help draw a few drops of blood from the finger, which is then placed
on a special absorptive paper card. After air drying for a little while, the
card is then placed in one of the special foil tamper-proof envelopes for
preserving and storing, on which personal information is recorded. If you
are too uncomfortable to use the puncture tool, the hair sample by itself
should suffice, which is stored and recorded the same way. Many parents just
take the kit to their pediatrician and have them draw the drops of blood.
Then, a personal information card on your child is filled out, including
attaching a picture. A fingerprint card is also included along with special
fingerprinting material and instructions. After you are done, everything is
then put in another, larger foil tamper-proof envelope and sealed. Personal
information is then recorded on the envelope and it is ready to be put in a
safe place. Unrefrigerated the samples should last for many years (they are
dry). Refrigeration will extend viability of samples much longer.
Unrefrigerated renewal is recommended once every five years.

Again, this patented system is a way of properly taking, storing, and
preserving genetic samples, not the actual test. If the DNA sample is ever
needed to make a genetic match the process is usually initiated by law
enforcement or some other agency. (Beware of suggestions to "make your own
DNA I.D." While storing DNA samples at home can be simple with a specially
made medical product like this, it can be completely ineffective without the
right procedures.) The DNA I.D. Kit can also be a part of your at-home fact
file. By combining an up-to-date child I.D. card and the DNA I.D. Kit,
parents can have a valuable child identification system.

DNA is so important to the future of identification that it is already being
used by the FBI and the U.S. Armed Forces. In fact, DNA I.D. is the
preferred method of identification for law enforcement, as seen in more and
more court cases recently. "DNA Analysis . . . is considered the most
important advance in forensics since fingerprinting. Its use in U.S. courts
has skyrocketed from 14 cases by the end of 1987 to 12,000 by mid-1993,"
according to an article in the Austin-American Statesman in June 1994. The
FBI is implementing a national DNA database, called CODIS, to track people
by their DNA. The U.S. Army started a genetic depository in 1992 that will
eventually include the DNA of every American in uniform. The U.S. Army's
goal is to have no more "unknown soldiers." DNA is also already being used
to identify missing children. For example, in December, 1993, a two-year old
was returned to his parents two years after being kidnapped - only after
police established scientifically who the child was by using "genetic
fingerprinting."

If you are ever separated from your child and time passes, DNA analysis is
probably the only way of making a virtually fool-proof identification. This
remarkable kit provides you with the tools you need.
