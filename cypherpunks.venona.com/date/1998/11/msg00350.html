Hi Mr. or Ms. support@xroads.com,

I'd like to advise you of abuse of your system and the resultant spam that I
am receiving as a result.

I've checked my subscription list and it contains NO xroads.com subscribers
at all. You are apparently having legitimite, non-commercial traffic
forwarded to your site in order to cause excessive work and potential denial
of services (to your customers).

Please police your own house before you go around threatening $500 leins and
prosecution on others.

Have a nice day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You can make money from information provision by charging extra for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up-to-date news, or by charging so little that the cost from the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; redistribute it,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's true now, why don't we see these effects...
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; We do. News inherently has a 'sell-by' date. The most obvious example is
&gt; &gt;&gt; stock quotes where delayed quotes are provided for free whereas
&gt; &gt;&gt; real-time quotes are heavily charged for. The recipients of such
&gt; &gt;&gt; information care very much about latency, since it's possible to trade
&gt; &gt;&gt; on any differences that may exist. There's even some research on attacks
&gt; &gt;&gt; that simply delay packets in such networks.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Ah, true but I was addressing the last sentence about the cost being so low
&gt; &gt;nobody will charge for it.....sounds like the nuclear industry marketing
&gt; &gt;speal of the 50's....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Sorry for the confusion, I guess I should have edited the first part out
&gt; &gt;since it wasn't relevant.

&gt;           + (1) Prohibitions
&gt;             
&gt;             It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States
&gt;             -
&gt;                o (A) to make any call (other than a call made for
&gt;                  emergency purposes or made with the prior express
&gt;                  consent of the called party) using any automatic

&gt;                  voice -
&gt;                     # (i) to any emergency telephone line (including any

&gt;                       mobile radio service, or other radio common carrier
&gt;                       service, or any service for which the called party
&gt;                       is charged for the call;
&gt;                o (B) to initiate any telephone call to any residential
&gt;                  telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice
&gt;                  to deliver a message without the prior express consent
&gt;                  of the called party, unless the call is initiated for
&gt;                  emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by
&gt;                  the Commission under paragraph (2)(B);
&gt;                o (C) to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or
&gt;                  other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a
&gt;                  telephone facsimile machine; or
&gt;                o (D) to use an automatic telephone dialing system in such
&gt;                  a way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line
&gt;                  business are engaged simultaneously.
&gt;           + (2) Regulations; exemptions and other provisions
&gt;             
&gt;             The Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement the
&gt;             requirements of this subsection. In implementing the
&gt;             requirements of this subsection, the Commission -
&gt;                o (A) shall consider prescribing regulations to allow
&gt;                  businesses to avoid receiving calls made using an
&gt;                  artificial or prerecorded voice to which they have not
&gt;                  given their prior express consent;
&gt;                o (B) may, by rule or order, exempt from the requirements
&gt;                  of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, subject to such
&gt;                  conditions as the Commission may prescribe -
&gt;                     # (i) calls that are not made for a commercial
&gt;                       purpose; and
&gt;                     # (ii) such classes or categories of calls made for
&gt;                       commercial purposes as the Commission determines -
&gt;                          @ (I) will not adversely affect the privacy
&gt;                            rights that this section is intended to
&gt;                            protect; and
&gt;                          @ (II) do not include the transmission of any
&gt;                            unsolicited advertisement; and
&gt;                o (C) may, by rule or order, exempt from the requirements
&gt;                  of paragraphs (FOOTNOTE 1) (1)(A)(iii) of this
&gt;                  subsection calls to a telephone number assigned to a
&gt;                  cellular telephone service that are not charged to the
&gt;                  called party, subject to such conditions as the
&gt;                  Commission may prescribe as necessary in the interest of
&gt;                  the privacy rights this section is intended to protect.
&gt;                  (FOOTNOTE 1) So in original. Probably should be
&gt;                  ''paragraph''.
&gt;           + (3) Private right of action
&gt;             
&gt;             A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or
&gt;             rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of
&gt;             that State -
&gt;                o (A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or
&gt;                  the regulations prescribed under this subsection to
&gt;                  enjoin such violation,
&gt;                o (B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from
&gt;                  such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each
&gt;                  such violation, whichever is greater, or
&gt;                o (C) both such actions. If the court finds that the
&gt;                  defendant willfully or knowingly violated this
&gt;                  subsection or the regulations prescribed under this
&gt;                  subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase
&gt;                  the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more
&gt;                  than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B)
&gt;                  of this paragraph.
&gt;      * (c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights
&gt;           + (1) Rulemaking proceeding required
&gt;             
&gt;             Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall
&gt;             initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to
&gt;             protect residential telephone subscribers' privacy rights to
&gt;             avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object.
&gt;             The proceeding shall -
&gt;                o (A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and
&gt;                  procedures (including the use of electronic databases,
&gt;                  telephone network technologies, special directory
&gt;                  markings, industry-based or company-specific ''do not
&gt;                  call'' systems, and any other alternatives, individually
&gt;                  or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting
&gt;                  such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and
&gt;                  other advantages and disadvantages;
&gt;                o (B) evaluate the categories of public and private
&gt;                  entities that would have the capacity to establish and
&gt;                  administer such methods and procedures;
&gt;                o (C) consider whether different methods and procedures
&gt;                  may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as
&gt;                  local telephone solicitations of small businesses or
&gt;                  holders of second class mail permits;
&gt;                o (D) consider whether there is a need for additional
&gt;                  Commission authority to further restrict telephone
&gt;                  solicitations, including those calls exempted under
&gt;                  subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a
&gt;                  finding is made and supported by the record, propose
&gt;                  specific restrictions to the Congress; and
&gt;                o (E) develop proposed regulations to implement the
&gt;                  methods and procedures that the Commission determines
&gt;                  are most effective and efficient to accomplish the
&gt;                  purposes of this section.
&gt;           + (2) Regulations
&gt;             
&gt;             Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the
&gt;             Commission shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated
&gt;             under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to
&gt;             implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy
&gt;             rights described in such paragraph in an efficient,
&gt;             effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of
&gt;             any additional charge to telephone subscribers.
&gt;           + (3) Use of database permitted
&gt;             
&gt;             The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the
&gt;             establishment and operation of a single national database to
&gt;             compile a list of telephone numbers of residential
&gt;             subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations,
&gt;             and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available
&gt;             for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a
&gt;             database, such regulations shall -
&gt;                o (A) specify a method by which the Commission will select
&gt;                  an entity to administer such database;
&gt;                o (B) require each common carrier providing telephone
&gt;                  exchange service, in accordance with regulations
&gt;                  prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for
&gt;                  telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide
&gt;                  notification, in accordance with regulations established
&gt;                  under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to
&gt;                  receiving telephone solicitations;
&gt;                o (C) specify the methods by which each telephone
&gt;                  subscriber shall be informed, by the common carrier that
&gt;                  provides local exchange service to that subscriber, of
&gt;                  (i) the subscriber's right to give or revoke a
&gt;                  notification of an objection under subparagraph (A), and
&gt;                  (ii) the methods by which such right may be exercised by
&gt;                  the subscriber;
&gt;                o (D) specify the methods by which such objections shall

&gt;                  section;
&gt;                o (F) prohibit any person from making or transmitting a
&gt;                  telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any
&gt;                  subscriber included in such database;
&gt;                o (G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring
&gt;                  to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain
&gt;                  access to the database, by area code or local exchange
&gt;                  prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone
&gt;                  numbers of subscribers included in such database; and
&gt;                  (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;
&gt;                o (H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons
&gt;                  accessing such database, the costs involved in
&gt;                  identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and
&gt;                  selling, and other activities relating to, the
&gt;                  operations of the database that are incurred by the
&gt;                  entities carrying out those activities;
&gt;                o (I) specify the frequency with which such database will
&gt;                  be updated and specify the method by which such updating
&gt;                  will take effect for purposes of compliance with the
&gt;                  regulations prescribed under this subsection;
&gt;                o (J) be designed to enable States to use the database
&gt;                  mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of
&gt;                  administering or enforcing State law;
&gt;                o (K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose
&gt;                  other than compliance with the requirements of this
&gt;                  section and any such State law and specify methods for
&gt;                  protection of the privacy rights of persons whose
&gt;                  numbers are included in such database; and
&gt;                o (L) require each common carrier providing services to
&gt;                  any person for the purpose of making telephone
&gt;                  solicitations to notify such person of the requirements
&gt;                  of this section and the regulations thereunder.
&gt;           + (4) Considerations required for use of database method
&gt;             
&gt;             If the Commission determines to require the database
&gt;             mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall -
&gt;                o (A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the
&gt;                  database, consider the different needs of telemarketers
&gt;                  conducting business on a national, regional, State, or
&gt;                  local level;
&gt;                o (B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for
&gt;                  recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such
&gt;                  differences and -
&gt;                     # (i) reflect the relative costs of providing a
&gt;                       national, regional, State, or local list of phone
&gt;                       numbers of subscribers who object to receiving
&gt;                       telephone solicitations;
&gt;                     # (ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such
&gt;                       lists on paper or electronic media; and
&gt;                     # (iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on
&gt;                       small businesses; and
&gt;                o (C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers
&gt;                  operating on a local basis could be met through special
&gt;                  markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if
&gt;                  such directories are needed as an adjunct to database
&gt;                  lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.
&gt;           + (5) Private right of action
&gt;             
&gt;             A person who has received more than one telephone call within
&gt;             any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in
&gt;             violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection
&gt;             may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of
&gt;             a State bring in an appropriate court of that State -
&gt;                o (A) an action based on a violation of the regulations
&gt;                  prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such
&gt;                  violation,
&gt;                o (B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from
&gt;                  such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages
&gt;                  for each such violation, whichever is greater, or
&gt;                o (C) both such actions. It shall be an affirmative
&gt;                  defense in any action brought under this paragraph that
&gt;                  the defendant has established and implemented, with due
&gt;                  care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively
&gt;                  prevent telephone solicitations in violation of the
&gt;                  regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the
&gt;                  court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly
&gt;                  violated the regulations prescribed under this
&gt;                  subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase
&gt;                  the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more
&gt;                  than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B)
&gt;                  of this paragraph.
&gt;           + (6) Relation to subsection (b)
&gt;             
&gt;             The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to
&gt;             permit a communication prohibited by subsection (b) of this
&gt;             section.
&gt;      * (d) Technical and procedural standards
&gt;           + (1) Prohibition
&gt;             
&gt;             It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States
&gt;             -
&gt;                o (A) to initiate any communication using a telephone
&gt;                  facsimile machine, or to make any telephone call using
&gt;                  any automatic telephone dialing system, that does not
&gt;                  comply with the technical and procedural standards
&gt;                  prescribed under this subsection, or to use any
&gt;                  telephone facsimile machine or automatic telephone
&gt;                  dialing system in a manner that does not comply with
&gt;                  such standards; or
&gt;                o (B) to use a computer or other electronic device to send
&gt;                  any message via a telephone facsimile machine unless
&gt;                  such person clearly marks, in a margin at the top or
&gt;                  bottom of each transmitted page of the message or on the
&gt;                  first page of the transmission, the date and time it is
&gt;                  sent and an identification of the business, other
&gt;                  entity, or individual sending the message and the
&gt;                  telephone number of the sending machine or of such
&gt;                  business, other entity, or individual.
&gt;           + (2) Telephone facsimile machines
&gt;             
&gt;             The Commission shall revise the regulations setting technical
&gt;             and procedural standards for telephone facsimile machines to
&gt;             require that any such machine which is manufactured after one
&gt;             year after December 20, 1991, clearly marks, in a margin at
&gt;             the top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first
&gt;             page of each transmission, the date and time sent, an
&gt;             identification of the business, other entity, or individual
&gt;             sending the message, and the telephone number of the sending
&gt;             machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.
&gt;           + (3) Artificial or prerecorded voice systems
&gt;             
&gt;             The Commission shall prescribe technical and procedural
&gt;             standards for systems that are used to transmit any
&gt;             artificial or prerecorded voice message via telephone. Such
&gt;             standards shall require that -
&gt;                o (A) all artificial or prerecorded telephone messages (i)
&gt;                  shall, at the beginning of the message, state clearly
&gt;                  the identity of the business, individual, or other
&gt;                  entity initiating the call, and (ii) shall, during or
&gt;                  after the message, state clearly the telephone number or
&gt;                  address of such business, other entity, or individual;
&gt;                  and
&gt;                o (B) any such system will automatically release the
&gt;                  called party's line within 5 seconds of the time
&gt;                  notification is transmitted to the system that the
&gt;                  called party has hung up, to allow the called party's
&gt;                  line to be used to make or receive other calls.
&gt;      * (e) Effect on State law
&gt;           + (1) State law not preempted
&gt;             
&gt;             Except for the standards prescribed under subsection (d) of
&gt;             this section and subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection,
&gt;             nothing in this section or in the regulations prescribed
&gt;             under this section shall preempt any State law that imposes
&gt;             more restrictive intrastate requirements or regulations on,
&gt;             or which prohibits -
&gt;                o (A) the use of telephone facsimile machines or other
&gt;                  electronic devices to send unsolicited advertisements;
&gt;                o (B) the use of automatic telephone dialing systems;
&gt;                o (C) the use of artificial or prerecorded voice messages;
&gt;                  or
&gt;                o (D) the making of telephone solicitations.
&gt;           + (2) State use of databases
&gt;             
&gt;             If, pursuant to subsection (c)(3) of this section, the
&gt;             Commission requires the establishment of a single national
&gt;             database of telephone numbers of subscribers who object to
&gt;             receiving telephone solicitations, a State or local authority
&gt;             may not, in its regulation of telephone solicitations,
&gt;             require the use of any database, list, or listing system that
&gt;             does not include the part of such single national datebase
&gt;             (FOOTNOTE 2) that relates to such State.
&gt;             
&gt;             (FOOTNOTE 2) So in original. Probably should be ''database''.
&gt;      * (f) Actions by States
&gt;           + (1) Authority of States
&gt;             
&gt;             Whenever the attorney general of a State, or an official or
&gt;             agency designated by a State, has reason to believe that any
&gt;             person has engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
&gt;             telephone calls or other transmissions to residents of that
&gt;             State in violation of this section or the regulations
&gt;             prescribed under this section, the State may bring a civil
&gt;             action on behalf of its residents to enjoin such calls, an
&gt;             action to recover for actual monetary loss or receive $500 in
&gt;             damages for each violation, or both such actions. If the
&gt;             court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly violated
&gt;             such regulations, the court may, in its discretion, increase
&gt;             the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3
&gt;             times the amount available under the preceding sentence.
&gt;           + (2) Exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts
&gt;             
&gt;             The district courts of the United States, the United States
&gt;             courts of any territory, and the District Court of the United
&gt;             States for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive
&gt;             jurisdiction over all civil actions brought under this
&gt;             subsection. Upon proper application, such courts shall also
&gt;             have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, or orders
&gt;             affording like relief, commanding the defendant to comply
&gt;             with the provisions of this section or regulations prescribed
&gt;             under this section, including the requirement that the
&gt;             defendant take such action as is necessary to remove the
&gt;             danger of such violation. Upon a proper showing, a permanent
&gt;             or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted
&gt;             without bond.
&gt;           + (3) Rights of Commission
&gt;             
&gt;             The State shall serve prior written notice of any such civil
&gt;             action upon the Commission and provide the Commission with a
&gt;             copy of its complaint, except in any case where such prior
&gt;             notice is not feasible, in which case the State shall serve
&gt;             such notice immediately upon instituting such action. The
&gt;             Commission shall have the right (A) to intervene in the
&gt;             action, (B) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters
&gt;             arising therein, and (C) to file petitions for appeal.
&gt;           + (4) Venue; service of process
&gt;             
&gt;             Any civil action brought under this subsection in a district
&gt;             court of the United States may be brought in the district
&gt;             wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or
&gt;             transacts business or wherein the violation occurred or is
&gt;             occurring, and process in such cases may be served in any
&gt;             district in which the defendant is an inhabitant or where the
&gt;             defendant may be found.
&gt;           + (5) Investigatory powers
&gt;             
&gt;             For purposes of bringing any civil action under this
&gt;             subsection, nothing in this section shall prevent the
&gt;             attorney general of a State, or an official or agency
&gt;             designated by a State, from exercising the powers conferred
&gt;             on the attorney general or such official by the laws of such
&gt;             State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or
&gt;             affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the
&gt;             production of documentary and other evidence.
&gt;           + (6) Effect on State court proceedings
&gt;             
&gt;             Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to
&gt;             prohibit an authorized State official from proceeding in
&gt;             State court on the basis of an alleged violation of any
&gt;             general civil or criminal statute of such State.
&gt;           + (7) Limitation
&gt;             
&gt;             Whenever the Commission has instituted a civil action for
&gt;             violation of regulations prescribed under this section, no
&gt;             State may, during the pendency of such action instituted by
&gt;             the Commission, subsequently institute a civil action against
&gt;             any defendant named in the Commission's complaint for any
&gt;             violation as alleged in the Commission's complaint.
&gt;           + (8) ''Attorney general'' defined
&gt;             
&gt;             As used in this subsection, the term ''attorney general''
&gt;             means the chief legal officer of a State.
