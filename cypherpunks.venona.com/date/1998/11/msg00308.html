&gt;Forwarded From: William Knowles &lt;erehwon@kizmiaz.dis.org&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[News.com] (11.8.98) Wang Global has introduced a new portable computer,
&gt;but it's not going to be winning any svelteness contests. 
&gt; 
&gt;Wang's Tempest Mobile Workstation, 3 inches thick and weighting 14.5
&gt;pounds, is designed for government officials who need spy-proof computers
&gt;that don't leak any telltale signals to electronic eavesdroppers. 
&gt;
&gt;The boxes are designed to meet the U.S. government's "Tempest"
&gt;specification, which requires a computer to release extremely low amounts
&gt;of electromagnetic emissions that could reveal what information the
&gt;computer is processing. 
&gt; 
&gt;To protect against such emissions, Tempest-compliant machines must be
&gt;encased in a lot of metal. Wang's portable looks like a thick laptop, said
&gt;Wang spokeswoman Loretta Day, "but it's really so heavy, you can't really
&gt;call it a laptop"  --all that metal would make it quite a burden for your
&gt;lap. 
&gt;
&gt;As an added bonus, all that metal shields the computer from the
&gt;electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by an exploding nuclear bomb that
&gt;wreaks havoc with anything electronic. 
&gt;
&gt;When it's running, the machine can withstand a shock of five Gs--that's
&gt;five times the acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity. But when it's
&gt;switched off, it can take a 60-G shock. 
&gt;
&gt;Aside from being spy-proof, the new Wang system has some features that are
&gt;familiar to ordinary buyers: a 15.1-inch LCD screen, a 233-MHz or 266-MHz
&gt;Pentium II processor, a CD-ROM drive, and your choice of a 4GB, 6GB, or
&gt;8GB removable hard disk. 
&gt; 
&gt;Wang also makes Tempest-compliant desktop computers, printers, routers,
&gt;switches, and servers. It's one of a handful of such companies that supply
&gt;the equipment to the government. Day said the chief customers are the
&gt;State Department and intelligence agencies. Wang also makes computer
&gt;equipment that complies with the Zone standard, similar to but less
&gt;stringent than the Tempest standard. 
&gt; 
&gt;Pricing on the Wang portable wasn't available, but a competitor's Tempest
&gt;portable computer with more lesser features was listed at one government
&gt;Web site as costing more than $10,000.
