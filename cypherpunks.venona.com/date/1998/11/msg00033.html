                   against being numbered 
                   Wins right to vote 
                   without Social Security registration 
                   

                   By David M. Bresnahan 
                   Copyright 1998, WorldNetDaily.com

                   LAS VEGAS, NV -- Even though government
                   agencies tried their best to stop him, an
                   18-year-old will vote for the first time in the
Nov.
                   3 election.

                   Last July, Joshua Hansen, 18, went to register to
                   vote. A few days later he received a letter in the
                   mail from Kathryn Ferguson, registrar of voters
                   of Clark County, Nevada, rejecting his
                   application.

                   Hansen had refused to supply a Social Security
                   number on his application and Ferguson rejected
                   him as a voter.

                   Hansen says he does not have a Social Security
                   number, driver's license, or government issued ID
                   card. He says that he never will. He also refuses
                   to pay income tax.

                   He defends his stands on these issues based on
                   his study of the U.S. Constitution and his
                   religious beliefs. He says he is willing to pay any
                   price and will not give in to government
                   pressure.

                   Hansen takes his right to vote seriously. So
                   seriously that he took Ferguson to court to prove
                   his point. With the help of his uncle, attorney
Joel
                   F. Hansen, he got the court to order Ferguson to
                   permit him to vote.

                   He belongs to the First Christian Fellowship of
                   Eternal Sovereignty, which he says is a political
                   religion based on Christianity and the
                   Constitution which people of all denominations
                   may join.

                   "It's a fellowship of anybody who's Christian
                   who really exercises their Christian beliefs within
                   politics," explained Hansen in a phone interview
                   with WorldNetDaily.

                   "The Social Security number was much like the
                   mark of the beast talked about in the "Book of
                   Revelations." One of the main reasons is that it, I
                   mean you can't buy or sell without it, it's hard to
                   do a lot of business without it. Have you ever
                   tried to get a job without one, or voting or
                   anything? A lot of the stuff talked about in the
                   prophecy had come to life and I said, 'I don't
                   want one of those.'

                   "Everything around Social Security is a lie. I
don't
                   want any of the benefits from it and I don't want
                   to pay for it. The system's going bankrupt.
                   Anything I pay for I'll never see anyway. It's
                   blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional,"
                   explained Hansen. 

                   Living without a Social Security number is a
                   challenge, but not a major problem for Hansen.
                   He has no bank account, works only for family
                   members who will pay him "under the table,"
                   refuses to get a driver's license, and won't pay
                   taxes. Recently he started his own Internet
                   consulting business.

                   He just finished high school this year and says he
                   has very few friends who believe as he does. He
                   belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of
                   Latter-day Saints.

                   "Because of my political beliefs," says Hansen, "I
                   have a lot of trouble getting along at church with
                   a lot of my fellow members." The members of his
                   church believe in "The Articles of Faith," a
                   portion of it reads "We believe in . . . obeying,
                   honoring, and sustaining the law."

                   "They told me that the law said I had to have a
                   number," explains Hansen. "I said, 'This is kind of
                   stupid because all these numbers are obtained
                   through the identification I already have.' When
                   you get a driver's license or an ID card here,
                   basically you show them your birth certificate,
                   and to prove residency you write down on a little
                   paper what your address is and sign something
                   that says you're not lying, which is all you do on
                   a voter registration thing."

                   Ferguson didn't like Hansen's logic. She rejected
                   his application to vote. Hansen contacted many
                   elected officials for help. Some responded and
                   some didn't, but none were of much help so he
                   decided to take it to court.

                   "The Constitution of Nevada establishes who can
                   vote," explained Hansen. "If you're an idiot,
                   you're insane, and if you don't have residency
                   you can't vote. That's it."

                   Hansen filed a Writ of Mandamus in the Clark
                   County District Court. The purpose was to have
                   the court order Ferguson to register Hansen so he
                   can vote.

                   Nevada law states that the "County Clerk shall
                   require a person to submit official identification
                   as proof of residence and identity, such as a
                   driver's license or other official document before
                   registering him."

                   Hansen presented a diploma from high school
                   and a birth certificate, but Ferguson demanded a
                   Social Security card, driver's license, or a state
ID
                   card.

                   Hansen does not have those items and in his
                   petition to the court his attorney stated,
                   "therefore, he presented alternative identification
                   to the Registrar of Voters, but his right to
register
                   to vote was refused and denied by the county
                   registrar of voters."

                   Hansen was more surprised than anyone when
                   his petition was granted by the court. "I didn't
                   think I'd win," he said. On Oct. 19, the court
                   ordered Ferguson to register Hansen to vote, and
                   he now plans to cast his first ballot on Nov. 3.

                   This may be just the first of many battles ahead
                   for Hansen. He does drive a car, and does not
                   plan to get a license.

                   "The government has no right to regulate who
                   can and cannot drive unless they have proven
                   themselves to be a danger to the community and
                   have been convicted by 12 informed jurors,"
                   wrote Hansen in an e-mail message to
                   WorldNetDaily.

                   "Assuming that everyone is already a danger and
                   by telling us we must have a license to drive is
                   known better as 'prior restraint' and according to
                   the U.S. Supreme Court is unconstitutional."

                   Hansen also objects to the current law which will
                   implement a national ID card on Oct. 1, 2000. He
                   says that Congress passed the law using illegal
                   immigration control as the excuse.

                   "The even more ironic twist is that most of the
                   illegal immigrants coming here are filtering from
                   Mexico trying to reap the socialist benefits
offered
                   by the federal government. Welfare, government
                   schools, health care, social security, etc. If you
                   want to stop illegal immigration bring back the
                   American way of work hard and succeed as
                   opposed to show up and leech off the tax
                   payers," wrote Hansen.

                   He concluded his e-mail by saying, "There is
                   nothing they can ever do to make me surrender
                   my personal freedom, nothing. I don't know a lot
                   of people who exercise freedom to the point of
                   fanaticism I do. I will not pay federal income tax,
                   I will not be marked my their unconstitutional
                   anti-Christ numbers. I will not take any of their
                   socialist benefits. I will not bow before any
                   bureaucracy. I will not surrender my God-given
                   freedom to those bastards for any reason."
