&gt; I left the good ol' USA too. I now live in a European country with a strong
&gt; socialistic government and I actually find very little interference in my
&gt; day to day life. In fact there seems to be a much higher awareness that
&gt; each

I find very little interference in my daily life as well (except when one of
you anarcho-cooks starts dropping bombs and threatening people).

&gt; 	Crap. They take 60+ percent of your income in taxes, that means
&gt; that they take 60+ percent of your working day.

They take 40% of my income, or are you talking of France taking 60% of your
income. Disagreement over the level or specific policies for spending it do
not justify eliminating the system.

&gt; 	They (at least france) throw up HUGE barriers to anyone wanting to
&gt; start a business, especially if they will need to hire workers. This not
&gt; only makes it difficult for you to start a business (which would never
&gt; happen since you've indicated you like someone else making decisions for
&gt; you) but also increases unemployment (prevents others from creating jobs
&gt; rather than just begging for them).

And you find that a better place to live then the US?

&gt; individual is responsible for his and her actions. At the very least there
&gt; aren't as many lawyers claiming everyone is a victim of something or
&gt; another (ie. too hot coffee, slippery floors, home owners that shot the
&gt; poor intruder who didn't get a warning first, etc.)

What is the percentage of lawyers in France to the total population?

&gt; Ain't no where perfect, anarcho-whatever was done about 4000 years ago, I
&gt; generally prefer to look forward...
&gt; 
&gt; 	So, the fact that it hasn't been tried in 4000 years means it will
&gt; never work?
&gt; 
&gt; 	I guess it's a good thing the wright brothers didn't take that
&gt; attitude, nor Robert Goddard.

We tried anarchy, it's called cave men. As to Wright and Goddard, they had
ample evidence in physics (that's been around what 4.5B years) to build
their expectations on. In the field of politics and social system the only
thing we have to go with is our imagination, patience, understanding, and
past practice. 5k years or a little more.

All of those say anarcho-anything systems won't work.
