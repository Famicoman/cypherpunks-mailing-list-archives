&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because you don't have a social institution that announces
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it has the job of killing anybody who competes with it or
&gt; &gt; &gt; fails to obey its proclamations of the will of the majority
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't mean you don't have social institutions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Nobody claimed that Bill, straw-man.
&gt; 
&gt; Now wait a minute, which side was it that said that an "anarchistic
&gt; society" was an oxymoron?

It wasn't me, I said it was axiomaticaly contradictory.

A oxymoron is two terms with contradictory meaning used together (eg
deafening silence).

  You know, that we can't have a society
&gt; without a state?

Than anarchy is sooooo screwed.

  The state is nothing but an organization which kills
&gt; anyone who doesn't obey its will (however that will is determined, or
&gt; however many orders it will give you before disobedience is fatal).

That's your rather self-serving definition. A state, used as a synonym for
government, has a much broader group of responsiblities.

  By
&gt; saying this, you *are* saying that it is necessary to "have a social
&gt; institution that announces that it has the job of killing anybody who
&gt; competes with it or fails to obey its proclamations of the will of the
&gt; majority" in order to have *any* social institutions (i.e., to have a
&gt; society).

Demostrate please. I have not said, nor said anything that implies that. I
have said that people have a right to self defence and as an extension the
need of armies and other such institutions are an extension of that. I also
believe that police should exist and should have the responsibility to use
deadly force, just not in as many instances as now.

Anarchist would leave it to the individual to decide, a bad precidence.

&gt; *We* weren't the ones who raised that strawman. ;)

No, *YOU* are exactly the ones who raised it.
