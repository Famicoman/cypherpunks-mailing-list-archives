&gt; From: Fred Cohen &lt;fc@all.net&gt;
&gt; Subject: The Deception ToolKit
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to announce and introduce a new security tool available for free
&gt; from over the Internet - The Deception ToolKit - available from <A  HREF="http://all.net/">http://all.net/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; The Deception ToolKit (DTK) is a toolkit designed to give defenders a couple
&gt; of orders of magnitude advantage over attackers. 
&gt; 
&gt; The basic idea is not new. We use deception to counter attacks. In the case
&gt; of DTK, the deception is intended to make it appear to attackers as if the
&gt; system running DTK has a large number of widely known vulnerabilities. DTK's
&gt; deception is programmable, but it is typically limited to producing output
&gt; in response to attacker input in such a way as to simulate the behavior of a
&gt; system which is vulnerable to the attackers method. This has a few
&gt; interesting side effects: 
&gt; 
&gt;   It increases the attacker's workload because they can't easily tell
&gt;   which of their attack attempts works and which fail. For example, if
&gt;   an attack produces what appears to be a Unix password file, the
&gt;   attacker would normally run "Crack" to try to break into the system.
&gt;   But if the password file is a fake, it consumes the attackers time and
&gt;   effort to no result. 
&gt; 
&gt;   It allows us to track attacker attempts at entry and respond before
&gt;   they come across a vulnerability we are susceptible to. For example,
&gt;   when the attacker tries to use a known Sendmail attack against our
&gt;   site, we record all of their entries to track their techniques. With
&gt;   this deception in place, we have no problem picking up port scans,
&gt;   password guessing, and all manner of other attack attempts as they happen. 
&gt; 
&gt;   It sours the milk - so to speak. If one person uses DTK, they can see
&gt;   attacks coming well ahead of time. If a few others start using it, we
&gt;   will probably exhaust the attackers and they will go somewhere else to
&gt;   run their attacks. If a lot of people use DTK, the attackers will find
&gt;   that they need to spend 100 times the effort to break into systems and
&gt;   that they have a high risk of detection well before their attempts succeed.
&gt; 
&gt;   If enough people adopt DTK and work together to keep it's deceptions
&gt;   up to date, we will eliminate all but the most sophisticated
&gt;   attackers, and all the copy-cat attacks will be detected soon after
&gt;   they are released to the wide hacking community. This will not only
&gt;   sour the milk, it will also up the ante for would-be copy-cat
&gt;   attackers and, as a side effect, reduce the "noise" level of attacks to
&gt;   allow us to more clearly see the more serious attackers and track them down. 
&gt; 
&gt;   If DTK becomes very widespread, one of DTK's key deceptions will
&gt;   become very effective. This deception is port 507 - which we have
&gt;   staked a claim for as the deception port. Port 507 indicates whether
&gt;   the machine you are attempting to connect to is running a deception
&gt;   defense. Naturally, attackers who wish to avoid deceptive defenses
&gt;   will check there first, and eventually, simply running the deceptive
&gt;   defense notifier will be adequate to eliminate many of the attackers.
&gt;   Of course some of us defenders will not turn on the deception
&gt;   announcement message so we can track new attack attempts by those who
&gt;   avoid deceptive defenses, so... the attacker's level of uncertainty
&gt;   rises, and the information world becomes a safer place to work. 
&gt; 
&gt; Your positive and helpful comments are appreciated.  FC
