&gt; &gt;                  her keys, she will not be able to prove it.
&gt; &gt;                  Therefor, we must assume that at every stage that
&gt; &gt;                  Alice has kept secret information from us, and
&gt; &gt;                  continue to beat her, even though she may have
&gt; &gt;                  revealed the last of her keys. But the whole time
&gt; &gt;                  we will feel uneasy about this because Alice may
&gt; &gt;                  have co-operated fully.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never really fully understood this assumption. It seems to me
&gt; that any person or group that would beat a person isn't going to
&gt; care much if Alice cooperated or not. 
&gt; 
&gt; All things considered, a group with enough power to grab Alice and
&gt; beat her probably has ways to escape punishment from the law, or
&gt; doesn't care about the law in the first place. 
&gt; 
&gt; In this case, I figure that their best option is to beat Alice everyday
&gt; forever or until she dies. Whichever comes first.

"Rubber hose" cryptanalysis needn't involve actual beatings in secret
underground cells. Simple example: Cops raid your house, rough you up
a little bit (not much) and toss your ass in a cell with "real '
criminals. 12 hours later they take you into a room and play good
cop/bad cop with you. Maybe you're not sure you could stand up to
this, and might panic and reveal more than you have to (remember, you
haven't been charged with a crime yet). However, if you do hold out,
the chances that you'll be let go, and get your stuff back in a few
years, are pretty high. In this case, being able to spill a key that
revelas harmless stuff is good, since the police are unlekely to hold
you for a long time.

"Dissapearing" is the regressive case, and there's not a whole lot you
can do in regressive cases. If someone really wants to defect, they
will.
