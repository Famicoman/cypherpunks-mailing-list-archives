Accept Checks By Fax or Telephone


Accept checks by telephone, fax or e-mail just like credit cards.  The
customers signature is not necessary.  Verbal authorization over the telephone
is all that is needed.  Increase your sales and collection results by 200% and
more.  Don't lose that all important impulse sale because your customer
doesn't have credit card or has no available credit to make a purchase.
Eliminate credit card chargebacks that can cause you to lose your credit card
merchant status!  Collect on that problem customer in advance to save you time
and money.  Do away with the check is in the mail syndrome.  It is fast and
simple to accept checks over the phone.

Donations

Collections

Sales

Monthly Payments

Post Dated Checks



Here's How It Works!

Your telephone sales or collections people simply collect the check
information right there over the phone, Telephone Check Systems supplies all
the necessary forms.  This information can either be faxed into the National
Headquarters 24 hours per day, or called in to them between 9 am and 10 PM EST
on any business day.  As soon as National Headquarters receives the
information they will immediately prepare a check against the customers bank
account.  The checks can be shipped overnight express 
so that you have them in your hands ready to deposit into your bank account
within 24 hours.  You can still withhold shipment for bank clearance just as
you might normally do with checks received in the mail or you can telephone
your customers bank to see if funds are currently available to cover the check
if that is your normal procedure.

Your Cost...As Low as $1 Per Check

Now...enjoy increased sales, payments, collections and donations at a very
economical cost.  Telephone Check Payment Systems' rates are only 1 3/4% of
the amount of the check, with a $1 minimum.  That means that a check for $57
cost you only $1.  A check for $100 cost you only $1.75...less than a credit
card order and less than the charges of any of our competitors that we know
of.  The one-time set up fee is $295 and you can use the service as much or as
little with no monthly penalties, dues or statement fees like there is with
credit card merchant accounts.

There are over 65 million consumers who have checking accounts but do not have
credit cards...plus millions of credit card holders with little or no usable
credit currently available on their cards.  You can dramatically increase your
sales by tapping into this huge market with your ability to take check
payments over the telephone.  To order your check by phone system complete the
order form below and fax to (405) 942-6553 along with your check for $295 or
credit card information.
