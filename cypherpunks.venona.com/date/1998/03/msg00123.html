              The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                            Presents

                        Adam Shostack
                         Netect, Inc.

                       "No Silver Bullet"
           Digital Commerce and Payment Security

                    Tuesday, April 7, 1997
                           12 - 2 PM
               The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                  One Federal Street, Boston, MA



The traditional threats that apply to digital commerce systems are the same
as the threats against all other commerce systems.  But the communications
networks that are available to the bad guys make possible and effective
attacks that could never work before.  Adam Shostack will examine some of
these new threats to electronic commerce, some of the potential solutions,
and share his vision of the future tools to protect commerce.

New attacks against commerce include the automation of knowledge.  The
pickpocket of old needed to practice for years to learn how to be
effective.  Today's 14 year olds can download a package with a win95
interface to exploit security holes.  The nature of the internet allows
them to engage in these attacks anonymously. The anonymous nature of the
net also means that people can engage in attacks that have a very small
payoff, or a small chance of a large payoff.  They also engage in attacks
for the thrill of it, costing companies trust and confidence, as well as
down time and its associated lost revenue.

New methods of dealing with the threats and problems posed by the
automation of new attacks will be required.  Where 'traditional' security
measures, such as firewalls, have failed to deal with the new attacks,
there is need to try new approaches. This talk will cover the new breeds of
attack, and the new methods of building secure foundations to help busy
companies cope.


Mr. Shostack is Director of Technology for Netect, Inc, a startup making
innovative applications to help cope with the new breed of security
problems.  He has extensive background in designing, implementing and
testing secure systems for clients in the medical, computer, and financial
industries. His recent public work includes 'Apparent Weaknesses in the
Security Dynamics Client Server Protocol,' 'Source Code Review Guidelines,'
and comparisons of freely available cryptographic libraries. Adam was also
one of the instructors, along with John Kelsey of Counterpane, and Gary
Howland of SecureAccounts, in Ian Goldberg's FC98 Financial Cryptography
Workshop, which was held in Anguilla in early March this year.



This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, April 7, 1997, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$32.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware, and
the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets
and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate business
attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since we purchase
these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the price of your
lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress code.

We will attempt to record this meeting for sale on CD/R, and to put it on
the web in RealAudio format, at some future date.


We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by Saturday,
April 4th, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks payable to
anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston", in the amount of $32.50. Please include your e-mail
address, so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.

Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

May       Jeremey Barrett     Digital Bearer Certificate Protocols
June      Michael Baum        PKI and the Commercial CA

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Commmittee, care of Robert
Hettinga, &lt;mailto: rah@shipwright.com&gt;.


For more information about the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, send

you want to subscribe to the DCSB e-mail list, send "subscribe dcsb" in the

Cheers,
Robert Hettinga
Moderator,
The Digital Commerce Society of Boston
