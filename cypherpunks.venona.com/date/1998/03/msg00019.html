William H. Geiger III said:
&gt;    I have noticed that many members of the list are missing the "big
&gt;picture" when it comes to fighting censorship.
&gt;
&gt;While I support the various efforts to combat the numerous attacks on
&gt;personal liberties world wide it is all for nought unless we push for
&gt;fundamental changes in government.
&gt;
&gt;There is an old saying: "Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts
&gt;absolutely".
&gt;
&gt;So long as we have Statist governments (fascists, communist,
socialist,
&gt;they are all the same) we will suffer a never ending infringement of
our
&gt;basic civil liberties. You can not give a government overwhelming
powers
&gt;to control every minute aspect of our lives and not expect them to
use it
&gt;AS THEY SEE FIT.
&gt;
&gt;We go on wining little battles over this law or that law only to be
losing
&gt;the war. Every year governments become more powerful, more
repressive,
&gt;and are freedoms are curtailed even more. We need to strike into the
belly
&gt;of the beast, and rip out it's hart. We must remove it's power to
tax, to
&gt;regulate, to control only then will we be free.
&gt;
&gt;Not only must we castrate this beast leaving it a shell of it's
former
&gt;self but we must stop being children and act like free men. We must
be
&gt;willing to stand on our own and take our destinies into our own
hands. We
&gt;must resist running to Big Brother every time we have a problem like
a
&gt;small school boy running to mommy when he scrapes his knees.
&gt;
&gt;It is far better to try and fail as a free man than to have never
tried at
&gt;all living the life of the slave.
&gt;
&gt;--


Well said William, very well said.  Free men must cooperate in their
own defeat, refuse to cooperate, refuse to give in, and you will not
lose.  In the end, tyranny will fall.

In the history of our civilizations, all governments have eventually
failed, regardless that they may have had noble intent in their
beginnings, and they have fallen.  So have each succeeding government
after them. They fail because when times passes, decades or centuries
(doesn't matter) the average citizenry becomes accepting and
complacent while said government becomes more and more abusive,
excessive, impulsive, and corrupt.  Finally, those people who can no
longer tolerate this from those who would call themselves their
rulers, rise to the occasion and the now festering, malignant
government is torn down.

Unfortunately, the cycle repeats itself.  The U.S. government has
lasted this long only due to the freedoms guaranteed by our
Constitution, but it still has been following in the tracks as all the
previous governments before it.  In lasting longer than any other
constitutional form of government, it is now so corrupt that at this
point only 1 of 2 things can really happen:  a 2nd American
Revolution, and hopefully a new start and (for the time being) a
change for the better, or total Fascism, and the last remaining
freedoms people have will be quickly extinguished.  I don't want to
live in a socialist environment.  I don't want somebody telling me how
to raise my children, and I don't want someone telling me I'm a
criminal because I don't want to let the government read what I have
to say.  It doesn't "Take a Village" and it doesn't take Big
Brother.... it takes freedom, ingenuity, drive, determination,
self-worth, cooperation, and dedication to build something better.

Scream to your Senators and Representatives, as loud as you can, we
all must do what we can, or we will be lost, and as William said, in
perpetual, permanent slavery, with no privacy, no rights, and no hope
for a self-determined future.  To hell with that.

Eric J. Tune
