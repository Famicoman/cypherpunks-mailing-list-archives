DATA FELLOWS LAUNCHES NEW VERSIONS OF THE FAMOUS 
F-SECURE SSH PRODUCTS

The improved F-Secure SSH product family is a unique tool for secure remote
systems administration

ESPOO, FINLAND --- Data Fellows, a leading provider of Internet security
solutions, has launched new versions of its famous F-Secure SSH products.

F-Secure SSH Tunnel&amp;Terminal and F-Secure SSH Server protect TCP/IP-based
terminal connections in UNIX, Windows and Macintosh environments. They
enable remote systems administrators and telecommuters to access corporate
networks via any Internet Service Provider without revealing system
passwords and other secrets to possible eavesdroppers.

"In addition to providing secure login connections, F-Secure SSH Server
secures all remote systems administration tasks by providing secure tools
to replace the existing rsh, rlogin, rcp, rdist and telnet protocols," says
Mr. Olli Voima, Product Development Manager of F-Secure SSH.  "As a new
feature, the secure file transfer application offers an easy-to-use
graphical interface for the safe transfer of files."

F-Secure SSH Tunnel&amp;Terminal and F-Secure SSH Server support the forwarding
of TCP/IP services like pop, smtp (used by e-mail software), http (used by
Web browsers), etc., or almost any other TCP/IP-based service.  The local
proxy server in F-Secure SSH Tunnel&amp;Terminal listens for a socket on the
desired port and forwards the request and data over the secure channel.  It
then instructs the F-Secure SSH Server to make the connection to the
specified service on the remote machine. Automatic forwarding of the X11
Windowing System secures graphical applications.

F-Secure SSH products are based on the SSH protocol, an application level
security mechanism used in conjunction with Internet protocols.

"The SSH protocol is the most widely audited and standardized security
protocol in the world," says Mr. Voima. "Its strong end-user authentication
and encryption leave no room for security compromises. As a European
company, Data Fellows is not restricted by the US export regulations, and
has thus been able to make strong encryption available worldwide. F-Secure
SSH host authentication is based on 1024-bit RSA keys, and the secure
connections use 128-bit session keys."

In addition to being strongly secured, the F-Secure SSH products are easy
to use.  The single sign-on technology makes the handling of multiple
terminal sessions simple. 

Says Mr. Voima:  "Easy-to-use and strongly secured, F-Secure SSH is a truly
unique security solution for remote systems administration."
