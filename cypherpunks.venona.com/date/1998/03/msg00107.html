Instructions for paper submissions: Submitted papers must not substantially
overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted
to a journal or a conference with a proceedings. Papers should be at most 15
pages excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using 11-point
font and reasonable margins on 8.5'x11' paper), and at most 20 pages total.
Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper
should be intelligible without them. Papers should be submitted in a form
suitable for anonymous review (no author names or affiliations).

   * Send via email to reiter@research.att.com a plain ASCII text message
     containing the title and abstract of your paper, the authors' names,
     email and postal addresses, phone and fax numbers, and identification
     of the contact author.

   * In addition, submit your paper using ONE of the following two methods.

        o Electronic submission (preferred): Instructions for submitting
          your Postscript paper by e-mail can be obtained from

          email to ccs98@research.att.com with the Subject line containing
          "HELP". It is strongly recommended that you electronically submit
          your paper at least five days in advance of the submission
          deadline, to allow us adequate time to verify that we can print
          your paper (and if not, to allow you to submit your paper in
          hardcopy to be received by the submission deadline). We cannot be
          held responsible for papers that we cannot print.

          Conference on Computer and Communications Security, and listing
          the authors' names, email and postal addresses, phone and fax
          numbers, and identifying the contact author.

Submissions received after the submission deadline will be rejected without
review. Where possible all further communications to authors will be via
