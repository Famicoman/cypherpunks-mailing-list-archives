DATA FELLOWS INTRODUCES THE SECURITY SOLUTION FOR CORPORATE NETWORKS

F-Secure VPN+ offers worldwide strong security for all aspects of today’s
networking

ESPOO, FINLAND  -- Data Fellows Ltd., a leading software development
company known for its F-Secure anti-virus and cryptography products, has
today introduced F-Secure VPN+, a complete security solution for all
enterprise networking.

F-Secure VPN+ is the successor of the award winning F-Secure VPN, an
encrypting router that enables one to build a virtual private network over
the Internet using strong cryptographic security. Now the F-Secure VPN+
product family is going one step further by facilitating the security
integration of small sites and independent workstations to the corporate
network.  The extended corporate network may include corporate sites,
partners or distributors, remote offices and even laptops. 

F-Secure VPN+ consists of three products: F-Secure VPN+ Gateway, F-Secure
VPN+ Client (for the desktop), and F-Secure VPN+ Server. These components
can be combined to build a variety of secure virtual private networks that
cover all aspects of corporate networking. Such VPNs include the following: 

- Business VPN+: provides a cost-effective security solution for intranet
connections between corporate sites. In-corporate communication can be
encrypted with powerful F-Secure VPN+ Gateways regardless of the network
technology.

- Partner VPN+: offers strong authentication and filtering capabilities for
extranet connections between an organization and its partners,
subcontractors, or distributors.  It keeps unwanted users out and
facilitates secure communication no matter where the data goes to.

- Remote Office VPN+: supports telecommuting as a method of working.  It is
a scaleable and cost-effective solution for securing communication over the
Internet for the Small Office and the Home Office.  

- Traveling VPN+: secures the extension of the corporate network to
employees on the road.  Typical remote networking applications, such as
email, or accessing corporate file servers, can be secured transparently.

- Service VPN+: is suitable for organizations offering systems management
services.  It ensures that only the authorized systems manager can access
the remote system and that administration data cannot be seen or tampered
with by unauthorized outsiders.  Service VPN also provides Internet Service
Providers with the opportunity to find new sources of revenue by offering
VPN based services, or hybrid customer networks with VPN links. Its
powerful management features help the operator in maintaining the customer
network.

"Small and medium sized organizations don't need to wait any more," Mr.
Jukka Kotovirta, Director of Sales from Data Fellows. "They are now able to
build their own networks by using regular Internet connections combined
with the 
F-Secure VPN+ security solutions. Large organizations can also utilize 
F-Secure VPN+ to extend their corporate network to sites outside the
corporate domain." 

F-Secure VPN+ is firewall and router independent, allowing for the building
of extranets on top of existing infrastructures.

"The F-Secure VPN+ architecture is uniquely wide:  it is compatible with
all existing router and firewall solutions, and all major platforms," says 
Mr. Kotovirta.  "For the end user, the strength of the product is its
transparency. As F-Secure VPN+ operates at the OSI level 3, which is
invisible at the application level, it does not require any changes to
applications or their configurations."  

The F-Secure VPN+ will be released in June-July 1998.  F-Secure VPN+ Server
will initially be available for Microsoft Windows NT and Sun Solaris. 
F-Secure VPN+ Gateway will operate in Windows NT and Solaris. 
F-Secure VPN+ Client will initially operate in Solaris, Windows NT 4 and
Windows95. The products use the SSH and IPSec security protocols.
