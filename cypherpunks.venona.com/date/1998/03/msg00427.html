Sorry to send you a form letter, but I have now received dozens of
copies of that "IEEE interview" hoax. Yes, it is (obviously) a hoax.
No, it is not a hoax done by me or any of my friends; had it been,
it would have been less crude and more funny.

If you want information about C++, see my articles and books.
You can find references, articles, book chapters, and even a couple
of genuine interviews on my homepages.

&gt;Subject: Stroustrup's interview leaked...
&gt;
&gt;On the 1st of January, 1998, Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview
&gt;to the IEEE's 'Computer' magazine.
&gt;
&gt;Naturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective
&gt;view of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language
&gt;he created.
&gt;
&gt;By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had
&gt;bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress
&gt;its contents, 'for the good of the industry' but, as with many of
&gt;these things, there was a leak.
&gt;
&gt;Here is a complete transcript of what was said, unedited, and
&gt;unrehearsed, so it isn't as neat as planned interviews.
&gt;You will find it interesting...
&gt;__________________________________________________________________
&gt;Interviewer:  Well, it's been a few years since you changed the
&gt;world of software design, how does it feel, looking back?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Actually, I was thinking about those days, just
&gt;before you arrived. Do you remember?  Everyone was writing 'C'
&gt;and, the trouble was, they were pretty damn good at it.
&gt;were turning out competent - I stress the word 'competent'
&gt;graduates at a phenomenal rate. That's what caused the problem.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Problem?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Yes, problem. Remember when everyone wrote Cobol?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Of course, I did too
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Well, in the beginning, these guys were like
&gt;demi-gods. Their salaries were high, and they were treated like
&gt;royalty.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Those were the days, eh?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Right. So what happened?  IBM got sick of it, and
&gt;invested millions in training programmers, till they were a dime
&gt;a dozen.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  That's why I got out. Salaries dropped within a
&gt;year, to the point where being a journalist actually paid
&gt;better.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Exactly. Well, the same happened with 'C' programmers.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  I see, but what's the point?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I
&gt;thought of this little scheme, which would redress the
&gt;balance a little. I thought 'I wonder what would happen, if
&gt;there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn,
&gt;that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with
&gt;programmers?  Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10,
&gt;you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics
&gt;system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things.
&gt;They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really
&gt;ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and
&gt;pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows
&gt;code. Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain
&gt;your sanity.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  You're kidding...?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Not a bit of it. In fact, there was another problem.
&gt;Unix was written in 'C', which meant that any 'C' programmer
&gt;could very easily become a systems programmer. Remember
&gt;what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  You bet I do, that's what I used to do.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  OK, so this new language had to divorce itself from
&gt;Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two
&gt;together so nicely. This would enable guys who only knew
&gt;about DOS to earn a decent living too.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  I don't believe you said that...
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Well, it's been long enough, now, and I believe most
&gt;people have figured out for themselves that C++ is a waste
&gt;of time but, I must say, it's taken them a lot longer than I
&gt;thought it would.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  So how exactly did you do it?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  It was only supposed to be a joke, I never thought
&gt;people would take the book seriously. Anyone with half a
&gt;brain can see that object-oriented programming is
&gt;counter-intuitive, illogical and inefficient.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  What?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  And as for 're-useable code' - when did you ever hear
&gt;of a company re-using its code?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Well, never, actually, but...
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  There you are then. Mind you, a few tried, in the
&gt;early days. There was this Oregon company - Mentor
&gt;Graphics, I think they were called - really caught a cold
&gt;trying to rewrite everything in C++ in about '90 or '91. I
&gt;felt sorry for them really, but I thought people would
&gt;learn from their mistakes.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Obviously, they didn't?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Not in the slightest. Trouble is, most companies
&gt;hush-up all their major blunders, and explaining a $30
&gt;million loss to the shareholders would have been
&gt;difficult. Give them their due, though, they made it work in the end.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  They did?  Well, there you are then, it proves O-O
&gt;works.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Well, almost. The executable was so huge, it took
&gt;five minutes to load, on an HP workstation, with 128MB of
&gt;RAM. Then it ran like treacle. Actually, I thought this
&gt;would be a major stumbling-block, and I'd get found out
&gt;within a week, but nobody cared. Sun and HP were only too
&gt;glad to sell enormously powerful boxes, with huge resources
&gt;just to run trivial programs. You know, when we had our
&gt;first C++ compiler, at AT&amp;T, I compiled 'Hello World', and
&gt;couldn't believe the size of the executable. 2.1MB
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  What?  Well, compilers have come a long way, since
&gt;then.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  They have?  Try it on the latest version of g++ - you
&gt;won't get much change out of half a megabyte. Also, there
&gt;are several quite recent examples for you, from all over the
&gt;world. British Telecom had a major disaster on their hands
&gt;but, luckily, managed to scrap the whole thing and start
&gt;again. They were luckier than Australian Telecom. Now I
&gt;hear that Siemens is building a dinosaur, and getting more
&gt;and more worried as the size of the hardware gets bigger, to
&gt;accommodate the executables. Isn't multiple inheritance a joy?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Yes, but C++ is basically a sound language.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  You really believe that, don't you?  Have you ever sat
&gt;down and worked on a C++ project?  Here's what happens:
&gt;First, I've put in enough pitfalls to make sure that only
&gt;the most trivial projects will work first time. Take
&gt;operator overloading. At the end of the project, almost
&gt;every module has it, usually, because guys feel they really
&gt;should do it, as it was in their training course. The same
&gt;operator then means something totally different in every
&gt;module. Try pulling that lot together, when you have a
&gt;hundred or so modules. And as for data hiding. God, I
&gt;sometimes can't help laughing when I hear about the problems
&gt;companies have making their modules talk to each other. I
&gt;think the word 'synergistic' was specially invented to twist
&gt;the knife in a project manager's ribs.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  I have to say, I'm beginning to be quite appalled at
&gt;all this. You say you did it to raise programmers' salaries?
&gt;That's obscene.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Not really. Everyone has a choice. I didn't expect
&gt;the thing to get so much out of hand. Anyway, I basically
&gt;succeeded. C++ is dying off now, but programmers still get
&gt;high salaries - especially those poor devils who have to
&gt;maintain all this crap. You do realize, it's impossible to
&gt;maintain a large C++ software module if you didn't actually
&gt;write it?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  How come?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  You are out of touch, aren't you?  Remember the
&gt;typedef?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Yes, of course.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Remember how long it took to grope through the header
&gt;files only to find that 'RoofRaised' was a double precision
&gt;number?  Well, imagine how long it takes to find all the
&gt;implicit typedefs in all the Classes in a major project.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  So how do you reckon you've succeeded?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Remember the length of the average-sized 'C' project?
&gt;About 6 months. Not nearly long enough for a guy with a
&gt;wife and kids to earn enough to have a decent standard of
&gt;living. Take the same project, design it in C++ and what do
&gt;you get?  I'll tell you. One to two years. Isn't that
&gt;great?  All that job security, just through one mistake of
&gt;judgement. And another thing. The universities haven't
&gt;been teaching 'C' for such a long time, there's now a
&gt;shortage of decent 'C' programmers. Especially those who
&gt;know anything about Unix systems programming. How many guys
&gt;would know what to do with 'malloc', when they've used 'new'
&gt;all these years - and never bothered to check the return
&gt;code. In fact, most C++ programmers throw away their return
&gt;codes. Whatever happened to good ol' '-1'?  At least you
&gt;knew you had an error, without bogging the thing down in all
&gt;that 'throw' 'catch' 'try' stuff.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  But, surely, inheritance does save a lot of time?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Does it?  Have you ever noticed the difference
&gt;between a 'C' project plan, and a C++ project plan?  The planning
&gt;stage for a C++ project is three times as long. Precisely
&gt;to make sure that everything which should be inherited is,
&gt;and what shouldn't isn't. Then, they still get it wrong.
&gt;Whoever heard of memory leaks in a 'C' program?  Now
&gt;finding them is a major industry. Most companies give up, and send
&gt;the product out, knowing it leaks like a sieve, simply to
&gt;avoid the expense of tracking them all down.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  There are tools...
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Most of which were written in C++.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  If we publish this, you'll probably get lynched, you
&gt;do realize that?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  I doubt it. As I said, C++ is way past its peak now,
&gt;and no company in its right mind would start a C++ project
&gt;without a pilot trial. That should convince them that it's
&gt;the road to disaster. If not, they deserve all they get.
&gt;You know, I tried to convince Dennis Ritchie to rewrite Unix in
&gt;C++.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Oh my God. What did he say?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Well, luckily, he has a good sense of humor. I think
&gt;both he and Brian figured out what I was doing, in the early
&gt;days, but never let on. He said he'd help me write a C++
&gt;version of DOS, if I was interested.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Were you?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Actually, I did write DOS in C++, I'll give you a
&gt;demo when we're through. I have it running on a Sparc 20 in the
&gt;computer room. Goes like a rocket on 4 CPU's, and only
&gt;takes up 70 megs of disk.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  What's it like on a PC?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Now you're kidding. Haven't you ever seen Windows
&gt;'95? I think of that as my biggest success. Nearly blew the
&gt;game before I was ready, though.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  You know, that idea of a Unix++ has really got me
&gt;thinking. Somewhere out there, there's a guy going to try it.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Not after they read this interview..
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  I'm sorry, but I don't see us being able to publish
&gt;any of this.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  But it's the story of the century. I only want to be
&gt;remembered by my fellow programmers, for what I've done
&gt;for them. You know how much a C++ guy can get these days?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Last I heard, a really top guy is worth $70 - $80 an
&gt;hour.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  See?  And I bet he earns it. Keeping track of all the
&gt;gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job. And, as I said
&gt;before, every C++ programmer feels bound by some mystic
&gt;promise to use every damn element of the language on every
&gt;project. Actually, that really annoys me sometimes, even
&gt;though it serves my original purpose. I almost like the
&gt;language after all this time.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  You mean you didn't before?
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Hated it. It even looks clumsy, don't you agree?  But
&gt;when the book royalties started to come in... well, you get the picture.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Just a minute. What about references?  You must
&gt;admit, you improved on 'C' pointers.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Hmm. I've always wondered about that. Originally, I
&gt;thought I had. Then, one day I was discussing this with a
&gt;guy who'd written C++ from the beginning. He said he could
&gt;never remember whether his variables were referenced or
&gt;dereferenced, so he always used pointers. He said the
&gt;little asterisk always reminded him.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  Well, at this point, I usually say 'thank you very
&gt;much' but it hardly seems adequate.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Promise me you'll publish this. My conscience is
&gt;getting the better of me these days.
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  I'll let you know, but I think I know what my editor
&gt;will say.
&gt;
&gt;Stroustrup:  Who'd believe it anyway?  Although, can you send me a
&gt;copy of that tape?
&gt;
&gt;Interviewer:  I can do that.
&gt;
&gt;
