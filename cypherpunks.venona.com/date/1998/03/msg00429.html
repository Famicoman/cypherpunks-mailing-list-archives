&gt;         A Compendium of Feedback on the Previous Week's Words in AWAD,
&gt;            and Other Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages
&gt;

&gt;Subject: AWADmail is back!
&gt;
&gt;AWADmail is back after a long hiatus.  Last week's theme, "Words whose
&gt;pronunciations differ a lot from their spellings" generated a huge
response.
&gt;Some sent their favorite words in this category (colonel coming at the top
&gt;of the list), while others forwarded poems lamenting the intractability of
&gt;English orthoepy and orthography.  Here are selected responses.

&gt;Subject: Phonetic Pronunciation
&gt;
&gt;In line with this week's critique of English pronunciation, dare I bring up
&gt;George Bernard Shaw's plea for spelling reform with the word 'GHOTI"
&gt;
&gt;GH   as in   "rough"
&gt;O    as in   "women"
&gt;TI   as in   "nation"
&gt;
&gt;GHOTI = "fish"
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;It's funny that a couple of the words you're featuring for being pronounced
&gt;differently than they are spelled have French origins. Being from Canada
and
&gt;therefore being exposed to French, I look at the word and think "What do
you
&gt;mean pronounced differently then they are spelled, how else would you
&gt;pronounce oeuvre."
&gt;

&gt;Subject: Another Pronunciation for "chaos"
&gt;
&gt;One of the characters in Sean O'Casey's play, "Juno and the Paycock," (it's
&gt;either Captain Jack Boyle or his sidekick "Joxer" Daly) regularly
&gt;mispronounces this word as "chassis."
&gt;

&gt;From: Fred Bartlett (fredb@springer-ny.com)
&gt;Subject: Chaos
&gt;
&gt;When I traveled to the old Soviet Union to edit the proceedings of a
&gt;conference on nonlinear dynamics, I was baffled by the (English) speech
&gt;of my Russian colleagues. They kept talking about "House" -- that is,
&gt;"chaos". It was all perfectly reasonable (though wrong, of course):
&gt;transliteration to Cyrillic and then pronunciation as if it were Russian.
&gt;
&gt;------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;From: Steve Royster (roysters@sec.gov)
&gt;Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--rendezvous
&gt;
&gt;I was willing to let oeuvre pass after I mistook it initially for the
French
&gt;word for "egg."  I learned something on that one.  But isn't "rendezvous" a
&gt;direct French import?
&gt;
&gt;    See next message. -Anu
&gt;
&gt;French, as the comedian Steve Martin has noted, is more torturous than
&gt;English: "It's like those French have a different word for everything!"  On
&gt;the album "A Wild and Crazy Guy," from early in his oeuvre, Martin
describes
&gt;a man who dies trying to speak French.

&gt;Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--chaos
&gt;
&gt;Your note on the need for pronunciation guidance in English reminds me of
&gt;what I used to tell students when I taught English as a second language for
&gt;ten years, mostly to native speakers of Spanish, Arabic, or Swahili.  All
&gt;languages are thieves, but most languages have the good sense to hide what
&gt;they've stolen by making it look like their own.  English, however, is more
&gt;vain or, perhaps, careless, and often keeps the stolen goods in their
&gt;original forms.  For example, when Spanish stole the word for driver from
&gt;French, it changed the spelling to "chofer," whereas English kept it as
&gt;"chauffeur."  This linguistic practice makes English one of the most
&gt;difficult of the Latin-alphabet languages to learn to spell.
&gt;
&gt;    In polite company it is called borrowing.  Whether these
&gt;    loanwords are ever returned is another matter.      -Anu

&gt;From: Bob Simmons (bsimmons@compassnet.com)
&gt;Subject: (Mis)pronunciation Guide
&gt;
&gt;While I applaud your intention to include pronunciation in AWAD, I think
you
&gt;should look for another source. Specifically, I have a problem with each of
&gt;the last three days' pronunciations:
&gt;
&gt;oeuvre (oe-VRUH) -- since this one retains its French pronunciation, it is
&gt;just about impossible to render in English.  When I say it, it sounds more
&gt;like e(r)-vra (with neither syllable accented). The way you've written it,
I
&gt;would say e(r)-VREW.
&gt;
&gt;segue (SAG-way) -- I have never heard this pronounced other than SEG-way
&gt;
&gt;rendezvous (RAN-day-voo) -- I would argue that RON-day-voo is closer.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    While reducing a spoken sound to its written form is tough enough
&gt;    in any language, it is nearly impossible to accurately represent
&gt;    pronunciation information using only the lowest common denominator
&gt;    of characters -- those found on a standard English keyboard. Not
&gt;    all systems have the capability to show phonetic characters. (Once
&gt;    Unicode is more widely adopted, it would be possible to show all
&gt;    IPA characters but for now we have to do with the seven bit ASCII
&gt;    character set).  It must also be noted that the pronunciation of
&gt;    words varies a great deal from region to region and any single way
&gt;    of pronouncing a word cannot be called the only correct one. In that
&gt;    spirit, the pronunciation guide provided with the words here should
&gt;    be taken as an approximation and not as a precise phonetic equivalent.
&gt;
&gt;    If you disagree with a given pronunciation or anything else in AWAD,
&gt;    please drop me a line at anu@wordsmith.org.  Due to large volume of
&gt;    messages, I can't always respond to you but I do read all
messages. -Anu
