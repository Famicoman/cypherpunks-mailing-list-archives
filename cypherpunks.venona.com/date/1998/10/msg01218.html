Press Release				For immediate release

Data Fellows Strengthens Its Position as Leading Data Security Vendor in
Europe

TSP and Its Worldwide Partner Network Joins Data Fellows

Helsinki, Finland, October 2, 1998 - Data Fellows, the developer of the
ground-breaking F-Secure Anti-Virus and Cryptography product family, and
the Dutch company TSP - The Security Provider have signed a cooperation and
distribution agreement. 

TSP, whose owners were behind ThunderByte anti-virus toolkit, currently has
over 40 distributors and 12 million ThunderByte users world-wide. TSP
specializes in security consultancy and marketing of information security
products. According to the announced cooperation agreement, TSP will
concentrate on selling Data Fellows products in the Netherlands, and its
international operations and distribution network will be taken over by
Data Fellows and its partners. 

"The addition of TSP to our list of partners will be yet another step
toward our goal of being among the top data security providers in the
world." says Risto Siilasmaa, President and CEO of Data Fellows. "Together
with Data Fellows’ complete line of data security products, TSP’s network
of distributors around the world is going to make a valuable contribution
to our existing world wide partner network that already covers over 80
countries."

Says Harald Zeeman of TSP, "The anti-virus market structures are changing.
The customers today demand overall data security solutions instead of point
applications. Therefore it is important for a small company like ours to
form alliances and thereby to remain viable. The future belongs to those
who have the broadest expertise and service to its customers.

"With this alliance we are able to serve our existing customer base by
offering them migration not only to the award-winning F-Secure Anti-Virus
product range but above all to the F-Secure Workstation Suite which Data
Fellows recently announced." 

TSP was founded in 1998 after Norman Data Defense Systems B.V. took over
the development of the ThunderByte scanning engine.
