          The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                       Presents

                       Dan Geer
                Senior Strategist and VP,
                       CertCo, Inc.

           Risk Management is Where the Money Is

                Tuesday, November 3rd, 1998
                       12 - 2 PM
             The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
               One Federal Street, Boston, MA




     The focus of "security" research today is the study of "trust
management," i.e., the study of how trust is created, propagated,
circumscribed, stored, exchanged, accounted for, recalled and adjudicated
in an electronic world.  This is both natural and mature -- natural because
security is a means and not an end, mature because security technology must
differentiate along cost-benefit lines.  All the security technology that
you can buy today enables some aspect of trust management and the academic
and entrepreneurial segments alike are busy supplying many novel ways to
propagate trust.  They have it all wrong.  Trust management is definitely
exciting, but like most exciting ideas it is not important.  What is
important is risk management, the sister, the dual of trust management.
And it is risk management that is the part of financial services that will
drive the security world from here on out whether you realize it or not.


Dan Geer is VP and Senior Strategist for CertCo, Inc., market leader
in digital certification for electronic commerce.  Dan has been at
a number of security oriented startups in the Boston area since
leaving academia where he was Manager of Systems Development for
MIT's Project Athena.  He holds a S.B. in EE/CS from MIT, and a
Sc.D. in Biostatistics from Harvard.  He was deeply involved
in medical computing for fifteen years.  A frequent speaker,
popular teacher and member of several professional societies,
he has been active in USENIX for some years at the Board level.
His recent publications include "The Web Security Sourcebook"
(Wiley, 1997) and the security chapter in Leebaert's "The
Future of the Electronic Marketplace" (MIT, 1998).


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, November 3, 1998, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of
the Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch
is $32.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, various A/V hardware,
and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code:
jackets and ties for men (and no sneakers or jeans), and "appropriate
business attire" (whatever that means), for women.  Fair warning: since
we purchase these luncheons in advance, we will be unable to refund the
price of your lunch if the Club finds you in violation of the dress
code.


We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we
*really* know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of
Boston", by Saturday, October 31st, or you won't be on the list for
lunch.  Checks payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston
will have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The
Harvard Club of Boston", in the amount of $32.50. Please include your
e-mail address, so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements
(We've had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for
instance), please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work
something out.


Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

December   Joseph DeFeo   TBA
January    Ira Heffan     Internet Software and Business Process Patents
February   Roland Mueller European Privacy Directive

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston
on the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, &lt;mailto: rah@shipwright.com&gt;.
