&gt; Subject: RE: GPL &amp; commercial software, the critical distinction (fwd)

&gt; 	Given that the textile/garment industry is often one of the first
&gt; and loudest pro-tarif voices, there might be a government manipulation
&gt; arguement there as well.

They are now, but your use of an example after the market was regulated to
argue that the behaviour of the market is due to being regulated is circular.

The garment industy wasn't *always* regulated. Prior to the early 1900's
they operated carte blanche regarding regulation. 16-20 hr days, 6 year old
employees, no insurance, etc., etc. At some point after the turn of the
century the social climate changed in such a way that these sorts of
behaviours became unacceptable. It could have been something as simple as a
series of newspaper articles that set it off. All that was required was that
enough employee/consumers figured the shell game out and screamed bloody
murder about it. You want to know what sets government off? It's the
realization by the constituancy as a whole that their collective suffering
isn't singular.

A more recent example, and local to anyone in the US is the air conditioning
repair industry. At one time prior to the late 70's and early 80's a license
from the state or city to specificaly operate a air conditioning service
industry wasn't needed. You simply got a regular old business license and a
pick-up. The abuses and failures of the industry led to enough noise and
complaints to the government to take a look into the industry. It's what
always happens, an industry goes along until it gets big enough to be
noticed by larger business. What after all is government but a form of
business designed to regulate other businesses and activities...

There was no government. Then there were many governments. Then the
governments have fight and reduce the number of governments. The remaining
governments move into areas that other governments don't or can't claim
effectively. Then each government exploits its resources until it's ready
for another go around.

The issue is human nature and not politics, economics, physical force, etc.

It's about power and not freedom. Power means you survive another day.
Freedom just means you get another shot at it.
