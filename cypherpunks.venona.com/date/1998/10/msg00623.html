   &gt;   From: John Young &lt;jya@pipeline.com&gt;
   &gt;
   &gt;   Crypto emissary David Aaron gave a speech today in
   &gt;   Germany boosting US encryption policy for privacy and
   &gt;   commerce. Says it's an insult to claim US intelligence 
   &gt;   agencies want backdoor access and other untrue myths:
   &gt;
   &gt;      <A  HREF="http://jya.com/aaron101398.htm">http://jya.com/aaron101398.htm</A>

A prime example of DoubleThink, since Key Recovery == backdoor access.

#   <A  HREF="http://jya.com/aaron101398.htm">http://jya.com/aaron101398.htm</A>
#
#   Clearly, a balance must be struck between the needs of businesses and
#   consumers and the protection of society as a whole. What is the
#   answer? We believe the answer lies in cryptographic systems that
#   provide trustworthy security services along with lawful access. By
#   lawful access, I refer to a range of technologies designed to permit
#   the plain text recovery of encrypted data and communications under a
                   ^^^^^^^^
#   court order or other lawful means that safeguards civil liberties.

In other words, they believe in cryptographic systems with backdoor access.

The NSA testified to Congress concerning lawful access:

: The Puzzle Palace 
:     Inside the National Security Agency,
:     America's most secret intelligence organization
: Author James Bamford, 1983 revision, ISBN 0-14-00.6748-5
:
: P381-382: NSA Director General Allen testified to Congress that there is no
: statute that prevents the NSA from interception of domestic communications.
: Asked whether he was concerned about the legality of expanding greatly its
: targeting of American citizens, the NSA replied: "Legality? That particular
: aspect didn't enter into the discussions."

The government's idea of "lawful access" is "anywhere, anytime".


#   <A  HREF="http://jya.com/aaron101398.htm">http://jya.com/aaron101398.htm</A>
#
#   We are not wedded to any single technology approach. Key management
#   infrastructures, key recovery and other recoverable products that
#   provide lawful access are some of the ways to achieve a reasonable
#   balance. We believe that seeking industry-led, market-based solutions
#   is the best approach to helping law enforcement.

Oh dey do do dey?

:     
: I was part of that OECD Expert Group, and believe I may shine at least
: some light on what exactly was said and happened at the meetings.
:
: The main conflict during all sessions was the demand of the US to be
: able to decrypt anything, anywhere at any time versus the European
: focus: we want to have the choice - with an open end - to maintain
: own surveillance.  The US demand would have caused an immediate
: ability to tap into what the European intelligence community believes to
: be its sole and exclusive territory. In fact the Europeans were not at all
: pleased with the US view points of controlling ALL crypto. Germany and
: France vigorously refused to work with the US on this issue.

: ... the Australian and UK views that felt some obligation
: from the 1947 UKUSA treaty (dealing with interchange of intelligence).

The US Government insists on the capability

   "to decrypt anything, anywhere at any time"

he said.

Gosh, that doesn't sound like they believe "market-based solutions"
are the best approach, does it?

*                   NEED FOR A NATIONAL POLICY
* 
*   A national policy embodied in legislation is needed which insures
*   that cryptography use in the United States should be forced to be
*   crackable by law enforcement, so such communications can be monitored
*   with real-time decryption. 
* 
*   All cryptography that cannot meet this standard should be prohibited.

No it don't, do it?

: *   The suspicion that the government might one day try to outlaw any

: *   reinforced by comments made by FBI Director Freeh at a 1994 Washington
: *   conference on cryptography. "The objective for us is to get those
: *   conversations...wherever they are, whatever they are", he said in
: *   response to a question.
: *
: *   Freeh indicated that if five years from now the FBI had solved the
: *   access problem but was only hearing encrypted messages, further
: *   legislation might be required.

Anywhere, anytime.
