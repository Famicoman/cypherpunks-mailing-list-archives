Hi,

Here is the note that I made regarding the saturation of free market
economies.

Note that this is several months old and I haven't been diligent in keeping
it fully up to date...

Forwarded message:

&gt; X-within-URL: <A  HREF="http://einstein/ravage/free.market.monopolization.html">http://einstein/ravage/free.market.monopolization.html</A>

&gt; This is the theory in its current working version:
&gt; 
&gt; An unregulated (free-market) economy will inherently monopolize when, but
&gt; not necessarily only if, the following are present:
&gt; 
&gt;  -  the commen assumption by current free market models that consumers
&gt;     are rational is irrational. A consideration of succesful marketing
&gt;     mechanisms and human psychology will clearly demonstrate that
&gt;     consumers are at best partialy rational. This is the fault in all
&gt;     anarchy models (eg crypto-anarchy), they assume in an axiomatic
&gt;     fashion that all participants will cooperate for not only their
&gt;     individual best interest but the cooperatives best interest without
&gt;     sufficient recognition that these may in many cases be in conflict.
&gt;     It is the same failing every form of government without a clear and
&gt;     proscribed list of individual and state rights and limits has, the
&gt;     assumption that some minimal set of behaviours or goals will satisfy
&gt;     all participants in all cases. The theory 'What is best for all is
&gt;     best for the one' is false.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  the importance of cooperation for mutual benefit that is axiomatic
&gt;     in current free market theories is false. Mathematicaly the prisoners
&gt;     paradox provides maximum payoff when defection occurs at a relatively
&gt;     high rate and in a random pattern. A primary goal of any business is
&gt;     not to ensure the survival of itself and it competitors but rather to
&gt;     eliminate competition through more succesful strategies. A rational
&gt;     consumer will act irrationaly at times because it is in their long
&gt;     term best interest. Therefore the distinction between rational and
&gt;     irrational consumers is false.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  the market is saturated, in other words the number of consumers at
&gt;     any given time are equal to or less than the service providers ability
&gt;     to provide that service (or resource). This means the long-term survival
&gt;     of firms is a function of retained market share and raw resource share
&gt;     control/ownership.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  the technology and/or start-up costs are high in material and
&gt;     intellectual factors. This minimizes the potential for new providers
&gt;     to start up. Providers will also require non-disclosure and other
&gt;     mechanisms to reduce sharing of information and cross-communications
&gt;     except under controlled conditions. Expect an increase in certifications
&gt;     and implimentation standards required to do business with the more
&gt;     succesful of these providers.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  an individual or small group of service providers have a small but
&gt;     distinct efficiency advantage in technology, manufacturing, or
&gt;     marketing. Over a long-enough time this market advantage will grow
&gt;     and as a result widen the 'technology gap' between firms.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  expect the most efficient firms to share their profit with the
&gt;     critical intellectual contributors. This further reduces the
&gt;     problem of cross-communication and new provider start-up.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  expect to see the more successful providers to join in co-ops with
&gt;     the less succesful providers. This will be under the surreptitous
&gt;     goal of 'developing technology'. It's actual goal will be to cause
&gt;     these smaller firms to commit resources to such enterprises. As soon
&gt;     as it is strategicaly advantagous the primary providers will break-off
&gt;     the co-op. This has the effect of further reducing the ability of the
&gt;     smaller providers to react in a timely manner to market changes or
&gt;     develop new technology due to resource starvation.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  expect to see the less efficient providers to combine in an effort
&gt;     to reap the benefits of shared market share and resources. Unless
&gt;     this partnering provides a more efficient model and there is sufficient
&gt;     time for that efficiency to develop these new providers will eventualy
&gt;     fail or be joined with other providers.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  expect to see the primary provider buy those less efficient providers
&gt;     that don't fail completely. These purchases will be as a result of
&gt;     some new or unexpected technology that will significantly increase
&gt;     the market share of the primary provider -or- it will be with the
&gt;     goal of eliminating this secondary technology and forcing those
&gt;     market shares to do without or use the primary providers technology.
&gt; 
&gt;  -  initialy prices for services will be low to promote purchasing but
&gt;     as providers obtain larger market shares their prices will increase
&gt;     over time and out of step with inflation and other market forces in
&gt;     order to widen the profit gap. The strategy is one of 'use it or
&gt;     starve'.
