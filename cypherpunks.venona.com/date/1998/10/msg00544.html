What Really Happened

Some time ago Mr. Clinton was hosting a state dinner when at the
last minute his regular cook took ill and they had to get a
replacement at short notice. The fellow arrived and turned out to
be a very grubby looking man named Jon. The President voiced
his concerns to his chief of staff but was told that this was the
best they could do at such short notice.

Just before the meal, the President noticed the cook sticking his
fingers in the soup to taste it and again he complained to the chief
of staff about the cook, but he was told that this man was
supposed to be a very good chef. The meal went okay but the
President was sure that the soup tasted a little off, and by the time
dessert came, he was starting to have stomach cramps and nausea.

It was getting worse and worse till finally he had to excuse himself
from the state dinner to look for the bathroom. Passing through the
kitchen, he caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end
and this made him feel even worse. By now he was desperately ill
with violent cramps and was so disorientated that he couldn't
remember which door led to the bathroom. 

He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally
found a door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in,
he realised to his horror that he had stumbled into Monica
Lewinsky's office with his trousers around his knees.

As he was just about to pass out, she bent over him and heard her
president whisper in a barely audible voice, "sack my cook".

And that is how the whole misunderstanding occurred.
