Could you mean this....

                First they came for the Communists,
                  and I didn't speak up,
                    because I wasn't a Communist.
                Then they came for the Jews,
                  and I didn't speak up,
                    because I wasn't a Jew.
                Then they came for the Catholics,
                  and I didn't speak up,
                    because I was a Protestant.
                Then they came for me,
                  and by that time there was no one
                    left to speak up for me.

                by Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945.

&gt; This ran through my mind this morning before I was totally awake. Maybe
&gt; somebody can help me with the original author of this....
&gt; 
&gt; When they came for Kevin Mitnick I said nothing. After all he was a big
&gt; time hacker and I wasn't a hacker so I did not speak up.
&gt; 
&gt; When they came for Jim Bell I said nothing. He was a criminal and I am not
&gt; a criminal so I didn't speak up.
&gt; 
&gt; When they came for Toto I said nothing. Surely he was nuts and I am
&gt; completely sane so I didn't speak up.
&gt; 
&gt; When they came for Jim Choate I said nothing. He runs a cypherpunks mailing
&gt; list and I don't manage any lists so I didn't speak up.
&gt; 
&gt; When they come for me who will be left to speak up?
&gt; 
&gt; This is a poor paraphrase of the original but I wonder if it is something
&gt; that we may be saying here in the U.S. soon?
