	I believe that the UN Universal Declaration of Human rights
includes the right to emmigrate without undue hardship.  I would
suggest contacting Amnesty International to complain about this
harrassment by the US government.

	Article 13, section 2, article 15, section 2.

| citizenship" that worked awhile back not effective today?
|

| means free to leave. 
| 
| Any advice?
