TWA FLIGHT 800 ANALYSTS SAY FBI IS INTENTIONALLY OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE

"I will probably never watch national
 television news again, and take it at
 face value for the rest of my life." -- Comdr.
 William S. Donaldson

The FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
intentionally lied to Congress and the public concerning key evidence about
the
downing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. So indicates recent evidence
brought to light in a tape-recorded conversation with James Kalstrom, the FBI
Special Agent in charge of the disaster investigation.

On that tape, obtained by Accuracy In Media (AIM) Chairman Reed
Irvine, Special Agent Kalstrom is allegedly heard to admit that U.S. Naval
vessels were present in the immediate area where, on July 17, 1996, TWA
Flight 800 was blown out of the sky along with its 230 passengers and crew.
Previously, the federal agencies contended publicly and in testimony before
Congress that the closest military asset other than an unarmed navy
aircraft, a
P-3 Orion, was the USS Normandy, 185 miles away. However, speaking on
condition of anonymity, a reliable source confirmed to The WINDS that the
claims Irvine is making as to the contents of the tape are indeed accurate.

In the recording, the details of which were disclosed privately to a meeting
of Washington's Judicial Watch, Irvine alleges that Agent Kalstrom is clearly
heard to confirm that there were in fact three U.S. Navy vessels within
three to
six nautical miles of the crash site. These ships, according to Kalstrom, were
on a highly classified mission. This information is enormously important
because it greatly strengthens the already formidable position of those
claiming
that a missile strike was responsible for the Flight 800 disaster.

Commander William S. Donaldson, USN Ret., a longtime thorn in the side
of the federal agencies investigating Flight 800, informed The WINDS that he
also has personally heard, and has a copy of, the aforementioned tape
recording. He quotes Special Agent Kalstrom as saying, in reference to
mysterious unnamed radar surface targets the FBI refused to identify, "We
know what they were...they were navy ships on classified maneuvers."

Of the two factions hotly advocating the facts indicating a missile strike,
one
believes it was an errant U.S. Navy anti-aircraft missile launched from those
very ships the FBI and NTSB claims were not present. The other position of
the pro-missile group asserts that the ships were present because the navy
knew that there was a threat of terrorist activity in the area and failed
in an
attempt to intercept the terrorists and thwart the destruction of the
airliner. This
is seemingly corroborated by eyewitnesses who claim to have observed a
previous attempt that failed, only because the vessel launching the
missiles was
too far offshore and out of range. Attempts to locate the craft bearing the
terrorists and their portable missiles were apparently the reason for the
"classified" naval presence in the area. It would also explain the presence
of the
P-3 Orion which is technically a navy sub-chaser but, according to Comdr.
Donaldson, can be used as a reconnaissance platform with its forward-looking
infrared (FLIR) optics and radar.

Comdr. Donaldson claims to also have obtained testimony from several
witnesses, one of whom "is an ex-Navy Bombardier/navigator aboard A6
Intruders, who observed an Aegis Cruiser to the west of the air disaster." An
Aegis is a highly sophisticated Virginia Class guided missile cruiser with
radar
and electronic counter measures (ECM) that would be immensely suitable in
searching for and neutralizing a seaborne terrorist threat.

Because of the highly trained nature of men such as the A6
bombardier/navigator, Donaldson, in his words, considers the identification of
the Aegis Cruiser to be "positive, with 100% credibility."

Interestingly, the USS Normandy, the one warship the navy admits was 185
miles away, is also an Aegis Guided Missile Cruiser of the Ticonderoga Class,
stationed out of Norfolk, Virginia, less than 300 nautical miles away--an easy
and quick journey for the nuclear-powered cruiser.

Either the former A6 crewman has extraordinarily good over-the-horizon
eyesight, or the Normandy (or another Aegis Cruiser) was much nearer the
scene than the navy and FBI are willing to admit.

Much to the dismay and irritation of federal authorities from both the FBI
and the NTSB, the specter of TWA Flight 800 simply will not go away.
Special Agent Kalstrom went on record as angrily denouncing those
responsible for perpetuating American consciousness of the tragedy--and who
disagree with their official position of cause for the disaster: an
internally ignited
center wing fuel tank. Kalstrom is also quoted in Salon Magazineas
arrogantly admonishing that "these people should get a life." [1]

In that article entitled, "The Buffoon Brigade," Salonrefers to those
opposing the government's declaration as to the cause of the crash as a
"motley army".

That "motley army"--the one advised by Special Agent Kalstrom to pursue
a worthwhile existence--is composed of such as:

 Pierre Salinger: 
once Press Secretary to President John F. Kennedy 
former ABC News commentator 

 Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, USN, Retired: 

Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arguably the most
powerful visible position in America outside the presidency (with
the possible exception of Federal Reserve Chairman) 

 Commander William S. Donaldson, USN Retired: 
Former Navy combat pilot 
89 combat missions over Viet Nam 
Several years as a highly trained aviation accident investigator
and team leader in a dozen or more military crash investigations 

 Richard Russell: 
Former 747 pilot for United Airlines 
Over 26 years experience with the Airline Pilots Association
investigating commercial aviation accidents serving as the Air
Safety Representative for the agency 

 Former U.S. Army Major Fredrick Meyer: 
Army combat helicopter pilot 
Extensive combat extraction experience in Viet Nam with
firsthand witness of thousands of detonations of military
explosives ordinance 
Currently an attorney and Air National Guard helicopter pilot 
First person on the scene of the Flight 800 incident after he and
his copilot witnessed from their ANG helicopter what he says he
would "swear to God, was [exploding] military ordinance"
bringing down the TWA jet.[2] 

"Motley army"? Could it be surmised that many on Salon Magazine's 
staff--and the FBI--would kill (metaphorically speaking) to obtain such a life
as have those men--that is, if intellect and integrity are any longer deciding
factors in the definition of "a life".

With the exception of Fredrick Meyer, who The WINDS has already
interviewed extensively for previous articles on Flight 800, and Adm. Moorer,
this agency spoke at length with each of the aforementioned individuals.

"IT IS VERY CLEAR IT WAS A NAVAL MISSILE"

Pierre Salinger has informed this agency that he is in possession of what he
refers to as "new information that makes it very, very clear it's a naval
missile
[that brought down Flight 800]....and very hot information about the number of
naval ships that were in that area--much more than anybody thought." He said
he was unable, at this time, to share details of that information with The
WINDS, but directed this office to a source which would. The information Mr.
Salinger alluded to, it turns out, is the same as what was revealed on the
aforementioned AIM tape recording.

Mr. Salinger has been the target of innumerable attacks by the media and
the U.S. Government for the position he has taken on the Flight 800 disaster.
"I've been so attacked by the press and everybody else," Salinger told The
WINDS, that he said he would not speak publicly on the TWA matter "until
the government comes out with what they claim to be a solution. If what they
say is something that we do not believe, then I'm definitely going to start
speaking." 

Interestingly, Salinger, and the unofficial truth about the downing of the
TWA jet, are taken quite seriously outside the United States media. In a
previous article, for example, The WINDS quoted The Times of London,a
newspaper of no small reputation, as reporting that "satellite images have
proved FLT 800 was tracked and hit by a sophisticated missile. 'An American
spy satellite positioned over the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long
Island is said to have yielded important information about the crash. A law
enforcement official told The New York Postthat the satellite pictures show
an object racing up to the TWA jet...and smashing into it.'"

"There was extraordinary information that was being dug up by other news
organizations that was blocked and never ever went to the press," James
Sanders, author of The Downing of TWA 800told this office, "and yet the
most moronic government statement would go to the head of the line in each
and every case."

According to current knowledge there is, it seems, as much firsthand
corroboration that the aircraft was downed by an errant or intentionally
launched missile as there is for the fact that Americans have landed on the
moon. Yet, the obfuscation in which the FBI, NTSB and other federal
agencies are engaged seems to effectively blot that fact from their conscious
thinking.

"That's something very weird," Salinger said, "because at that time, as a
matter of fact, at the top of [Agent] Kalstrom's list was the missile
theory. So
why," Salinger asked, "was he attacking me when I said it was a missile? The
reason he did is that I was talking about a naval missile--that's why. He
himself
was thinking at that time that it was a missile," Mr. Salinger continued. "And
you know there were 350 witnesses that saw the missiles."

When asked if he thought that the media assault on him was orchestrated by
the government he replied, "I don't have any actual facts but I have had
people
tell me that it resulted because the FBI was in touch with the media."

Of the two positions previously mentioned as to the origin of the missiles
that destroyed Flight 800 in the eastern sky that July evening, the one headed
by Comdr. Donaldson holds that the missiles were SA6 SAMs (surface-to-air
missiles) of Soviet origin, launched by terrorists. The other view,
espoused by
Pierre Salinger and James Sanders, et. al., is that the missiles were errantly
fired by the U.S. Navy ships in the vicinity. There is, however, no dissension
between the camps on the fact that irrefutable data points to some manner of
anti-aircraft missile ordinance, whatever its origin, as the source of the
tragedy
and definitely away from the absurdities of, as Sanders puts it, "moronic
government statements".

In his interview with The WINDS Mr. Sanders, expressing his frank
admiration for the former Navy Commander, admitted, "I really didn't have the
ability to get at the things that Donaldson has gotten at." Comdr. Donaldson's
chief logical argument against a failed navy missile test comes from his many
years experience with naval operations. He claims that the navy would never
test fire a missile off the U.S. coast with the capability, should it
malfunction, of
reaching land.

The fact that it is now apparently confirmed that there were, indeed, naval
warships in the near vicinity of the Flight 800 downing should cause
critics to
look more closely at the facts and compare them with what is becoming even
more confused and bewildered government explanations of the incident. But
will this new evidence of a government cover-up make any difference as to
whether the truth will be heard and accepted? This is the haunting question
that
pursues those who are perhaps getting their first real experience into the
power
that the New World Order exercises over information flow.

Their power for creating media stupefaction was vividly presented in the
opening paragraph of a recent Village Voice?article. "In January more than
twenty-five reporters attended the Washington, D.C. press conference,"
Voicecorrespondent Robert Davey reported in July, "--virtually a military
briefing that for all the actual media coverage it received might as well have
been labeled Top Secret. At the widely ignored event retired Navy pilot
Commander William S. Donaldson and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer announced that evidence existed to suggest
that a surface-to-air missile brought down TWA Flight 800."

Davey shared, on the syndicated Mike Jarmus radio talk show, that he had
first become interested in the TWA Flight 800 affair "in Christmas of '96
after
Pierre Salinger came out with his charges," he said. "And it struck me as
interesting the way he was greeted with such hostility and so disparaged in
the
media." 

 AS AIRTIGHT AS IT GETS: Commander William
Donaldson pulls the flowers out of the FBI's garden. 

In a stinging letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh, Comdr. Donaldson presents
a most cogent and concise assembly of facts, decimating the government's
position on the cause of the tragedy.

In that document, a copy of which Comdr. Donaldson submitted to The
WINDS, he begins:

 "Considering your New York office's recent abandonment of its
 law enforcement responsibilities, let me refresh your memory and
 provide the following reality check:

 FACTS

In the entire history of American turbine powered civilian
air transport, there has never been an in-flight fuel tank
explosion in any aircraft caused by mechanical failure!
(Laws of probability do not support the NTSB theory). 
Jet A-1 fuel used by FL800 is safer than all its
predecessors. It cannot be made to explode in-flight unless
the tank is first exposed to shock (chemical properties of
the fuel do not support the NTSB theory)." 

Commander Donaldson informed The WINDS of an experiment he had
conducted for Fox Television News and other news organizations in which he
demonstrated by the use of Jet A-1 fuel in a tank at the same vapor
concentration that would have been present in Flight 800's center wing tank
that it could not have exploded as the federal authorities contend. None of
the
footage, Donaldson said, ever made it on the air.

Donaldson continues:

The fuel temperature in TWA 800's center wing tank
(CWT) was well below minimum flammability much less at
explosive vapor temperatures. (Environmental conditions
do not support the NTSB theory). 

There is no source of ignition in the B747 CWT (aircraft
design does not support the NTSB theory). 

Conventionally designed aircraft cannot fly much less
generate lift to climb absent the gross tonnage of fuselage
forward of the wing. (Laws of physical science and
principles of aerodynamics do not support the NTSB
theory). 

The twelve or more explosive chemical residue hits by
BATF's EGIS 3000 equipment are physical evidence of
high explosive involvement. (Leading edge hi-tech forensic
evidence does not support the NTSB theory). 

Testimony from eyewitnesses along eleven nautical miles of
shore front show first sightings of ascending objects that
cross correlate to a launch position well away from
FL800's track. (Eyewitness testimony does not support
the NTSB theory). 

The medical examiners' report shows a uniform
instantaneous cause of death and evidence of high velocity
metal in the cabin. (Post mortem examinations do not
support the NTSB theory). 

The debris field shows that TWA FL800's nose forward
of the wing was shattered after being hit from the left by a
huge force that distributed the gross tonnage as much as
2900 ft. right of the projected aircraft track. (Debris field
evidence does not support the NTSB theory). 

Comdr. Donaldson's letter to Director Freeh continues in considerably more
technical detail with each point followed by the parenthetical summation
ending
with "(...does not support the NTSB theory)."

Other points including those summations are: 

(Ballistic geometry does not support the NTSB theory). 

(The historical record of airframe damage during in-flight
center wing tank explosions does not support the NTSB
theory). 

The forward cabin debris shows through-holes from left
side to right side [those that would have been made by a
high-speed object such as a missile passing through the
747's fuselage]. (The forward cabin debris does not
support the NTSB theory). 

The debris field shows initial cabin integrity was lost, 16
feet forward of the center wing tank at FS800, forward
left hand cargo bay. (The cabin break-up sequence does
not support the NTSB theory). 

Comdr. Donaldson then concludes his list of details, with which he is at
odds with federal authorities, with the pointed comment:

 The FBI has withdrawn before the cause has been determined.
 (The FBI does support the NTSB theory). Why?

Under the heading: "Collusion with NTSB Goals, Suppression of
Eyewitness Evidence" Donaldson continues to flay the FBI director with his
eminently logical analysis of the incident.

 Mr. Freeh I will be candid, the fact that the FBI is now joining in
 lockstep with the NTSB political script sadly was not a surprise
 to me, because of what I had discovered on Long Island. 

 Mr. Kalstrom's agents who 'who turned over every rock ten
 times' failed to tape critical eyewitness testimony, failed to
 establish visual bearing lines from the witnesses who observed
 ascending objects, failed to get elevation measurements, failed to
 get relative motion statements and in some cases failed to even go
 to the observation point, that is except from some eyewitnesses
 who didn't see the missile!...

 Multiple witnesses tell me agents on rare second or third visits to
 persons who saw ascending objects tried to get the witnesses to
 change their original stories? Many of these people are now
 afraid of and disgusted with their own government, the
 administrative mantra "no evidence of criminal act" is turning
 normal American citizens into bitter cynics."

Referring to the FBI's tightly choreographed control and feed of the media
Comdr. Donaldson seems to have no other recourse than to resort to sarcastic
humor in making his point on the ridiculous show produced for public
consumption.

"It was entertaining," Donaldson told Director Freeh, referring to the CIA's
14-minute animated video on the disaster, "but like most cartoons [it] grossly
abused universal laws of nature. Like: Newton's law of gravitation, Newton's
first and second law of dynamics, Newton's' law of hydro-dynamic resistance
and fundamental principles of aerodynamic lift, drag, dynamic stability and
jet
engine mechanics. Other than that," Donaldson cynically observes, "it was a
media masterpiece....Perfect junk science fluff for television."

The former navy commander continues to thoroughly wrap the
extraordinarily flawed FBI investigation in his Gordian Knot of logic as he,
point-by-point, encases the agency and the NTSB within a web of seemingly
inescapable logic. At one point he berates Freeh's organization by telling him
that if his "people had continued the commendable job the county police
started and actually developed witnesses who observed ascending objects, as
they [the county police] were doing, you would have provided the CIA with
data showing the object was moving three times faster than a 747 and was first
sighted close to shore."

Donaldson calls the CIA's "cartoon" a "most outlandish abridgment of
testimony and obstruction of justice" referring to the "amateurish
depiction of
sound analysis which claims that only the sound of the aircraft was actually
heard during the disaster. This, Comdr. Donaldson claims, fails "to consider
the number of explosions heard by witnesses."

Responding to the bizarre assumption that a noseless 747 could continue to
climb another 3,000 feet when it was already just above stalling speed, the
former U.S. Naval aviator asks rhetorically, "why doesn't the New York office
just have the cartoon changed and get the 747 to zoom climb to 30,000
feet...[?] After all, the cartoon's pilotless 747 [pilotless because the nose
section of the fuselage containing the pilots had been sheared off] is
already the
current record holder in the zoom climb category."

To this contention by the FBI and NTSB that the aircraft continued to climb
for another 3,000 feet after losing nearly everything forward of the leading
edge of the wings, the Pensacola News Journalcites Donaldson as saying,
"The final readings show chaos in the sky - with airspeed dropping
instantly by
almost 200 knots, the pitch angle jumping five degrees, altitude DROPPING
3,600 feet in about three seconds, the roll angle going from zero to 144
degrees (the airplane almost inverted), and the magnetic heading changing from
82 degrees [just North of due East] to 163 degrees [just East of due
South]."[emphasis supplied]. By Donaldson's account it appears that only if
one were
standing on their head while evaluating the data, could it have been
misconstrued as the aircraft CLIMBING 3,000 feet.

"'There couldn't have been an aviator at CIA who had anything to do with
that,' Donaldson said, 'They were laughed out of town by pilots.'" [ibid.]

"They [the CIA] failed to address the two 'bright', 'hard', 'high velocity',
'ordinance"' explosions three seconds apart, in addition to the large
petroleum
[fuel] explosion agreed to by witnesses airborne, on land and sea."

Donaldson continues by explaining in detail how the linear scattering of the
747's debris is impossible to explain by any other theory than a high velocity
inertial and explosive impact crossing the aircraft's flight path.

As mentioned before, Comdr. Donaldson's logic seems inescapable and has
not been intelligently refuted in any government press release or document The
WINDS has been able to obtain. With his particularly blunt humor the former
naval officer, under the subheading, "The Train Wreck at 13,700 Feet" makes
the assertion:

 From a physics point of view, TWA FL800, at the time of the
 incident, represented a force of about 465 million foot pounds of
 inertia oriented on a vector of 071 [degrees] at 13,700 ft.

 In order to deflect the gross tonnage of debris to the positions
 found in the field, much of it thousands of feet right of course,
 either the aircraft was hit by an Amtrak metro-liner on the left
 side or by a powerful anti-aircraft weapon.

 Much of the forward fuselage debris is strung out on a
 160-degree axis which closely matches observed eyewitness
 missile intercept angles as well as known fuselage through-holes.

 Because the wind was very light and almost on the tail, the
 maximum windage offset of falling metal debris would be
 approximately an additional 200 ft. downrange. The same offset
 would be nearly universal throughout the field on similar heavy
 debris, but proportionally further for light debris.

 This massive deflection of tons of debris to the right...are absolute
 and irrefutable physical evidence of a massive blow to the
 forward fuselage from the left side.

Comdr. Donaldson then proceeds to confront the FBI director with even
more serious charges. Under the heading of "Obstruction of Justice by
Political
Intercept" Donaldson charges, 

 Mr. Freeh, I am keenly aware of the justice department's
 suppression of the EGIS 3000 high explosive residue evidence
 gathered by BATF. Having consulted with both the equipment
 manufacturer and independent high explosive experts, the picture
 is clear.

Donaldson then explains for Director Freeh that the EGIS 3000, the most
advanced and sensitive state-of-the-art chemical analysis instrument currently
in existence, determined in no less than twelve instances that residue from
the
high explosive PETN was present on parts of the aircraft's wreckage. PETN is
an explosive used in, among other applications, the detonation of
plutonium-based nuclear weapons, as well as some commercial employment.

The flight data recorder apparently presents another critical piece of
evidence pointing to a cover-up. According to a report published by the
Pensacola News Journalin January of this year the NTSB is said to have
explained why the transcript of the last five seconds of Flight 800's data
recorder was cut. They claimed it was a leftover segment from a previous
flight. "'The only reason you put flight data recorders into an airplane at
millions
of dollars' cost,'" the newspaper quotes Commander Donaldson as saying, "'is
to capture this last data line.'"[3]

The explanation given by the NTSB is that the last five seconds were left
over from a preceding flight. The paper quotes TWA pilot Howard Mann as
saying, "not possible - it's erased - there's just no way." [ibid.]

 RADAR TAPE AUTHENTIC - - FBI FRANTIC

Richard Russell, former 747 pilot for United Airlines with twenty-six years
experience in airline accident investigation with the Airline Pilots
Association,
obtained another crucial piece of evidence in the damning mosaic that
describes the last moments of the life of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 and
its occupants. Through undisclosed sources Mr. Russell came into possession
of a copy of the FAA radar video tape of the sky from which the ill-fated jet
fell.

When the FBI discovered that he had it, Russell told The WINDS, they
immediately confiscated it.

"After obtaining a copy of the tape," Russell said, "I studied it--I've worked
with air traffic control problems for years and years and I know what's on
that
tape. I can read it. What was on that tape," he asserts, "was not an
electronic
glitch. This was an unidentified rogue target going some place in a big
hurry--not a ghost target. But it is a definite rogue target that appears
for four
sweeps and then disappears."

A rogue target, Russell explained, differs from a ghost in that the rogue is
very real--just unidentified-- whereas a ghost target is a glitch, an
electronic
artifact that doesn't exist in real life.

"The interesting part about this," Russell added, "is that this target
appeared
just seconds before TWA 800 blows up. The speed of the target during those
four sweeps indicates something that was traveling very fast. They have never
talked about it," Russell elaborates. "They still will not talk about it.
Several
controllers, I'm not sure how many, actually reported that it was a missile."

When The WINDS asked Mr. Russell if he had been able to extrapolate
the speed of the object from the radar images, he declined to share that
data at
this time. He merely stated that "it's faster than any jets that we have
presently
operating except for the Concord, and this was not a Concord."

Russell then makes what, under normal circumstances, would seem an
incredible allegation. Concerning those controllers who claimed they saw a
radar missile track arcing toward Flight 800, "James Hall, the NTSB chairman,
told Barry Valentine--at that time acting head of the FAA--to obtain signed
statements from all the controllers that they were mistaken as to what they
saw. Barry Valentine, as far as I'm concerned, was the only guy in the FAA
who had any guts. He said, 'I won't do it.' None of them signed the statement
and, apparently because of that, Barry Valentine was involuntarily retired."

Author James Sanders is another who has felt the intense displeasure of the
government for his activities in exposing the cover-up of what has become the
most investigated air disaster in history.

Sanders is currently under indictment for receiving stolen wreckage of Flight
800.[4] He is accused of asking a TWA pilot, Terrell Stacey, to obtain
parts of
the aircraft including a piece of seat material from the Flight 800 wreckage,
even though the "hanger man", as Sanders refers to him in his book, testified
that he provided Sanders with the material "of his own volition"--without
being
asked. The government is proceeding with its prosecution of Sanders and his
wife, even in the face of federal case law that gives journalists the right to
request such services.

An interesting study in paradoxical hypocrisy is that Special Agent
Kalstrom, himself, took pieces of the aircraft as souvenirs for certain
people,
according to Sanders, Donaldson and other sources. This was done about ten
days after the incident, Sanders says, which was before anyone knew what
potential investigation value any debris pieces might have. Yet, Kalstrom
suffers no legal problems from his action even though the law, Sanders claims,
clearly defines the act of retrieving such material for souvenir purposes
to be
illegal--while, at the same time, defining Sanders' actions as permissible for
journalists.

"Both my wife and I were in hiding from the FBI and she was under
psychiatric care," Sanders told The WINDS.

Part of what caused the government to go after Sanders and his wife,
Elizabeth, was his insistence that the clearly visible reddish stain that
contaminated row 14 of the TWA jet was, in reality, rocket fuel residue.
Sanders claims that the federal agencies are afraid to do an analysis of the
substance.

"I have a legally tape-recorded conversation with a government official, Dr.
Merrit Burgee," Sanders claims, "who was the senior scientist for the NTSB in
Calverton Hanger [where Flight 800 wreckage is stored]. I have him on tape
admitting that they never intended to find out if my residue was from a
missile
or not. On that tape," the author explains, the chemist "very clearly says
that
several times, and then he gives the very telling statement that 'Boy, if
we had
analyzed it and it came out wrong, then what do we do? We could never put
this thing to bed.'"

The FBI claimed, in March of last year, that the residue was glue. However,
Sanders claims that Charles W. Bassett [the chemist in charge of Flight 800
chemical analysis] agreed to him with a notarized affidavit concluding
"absolutely that the residue the FBI and NTSB were calling glue most certainly
was not."

Sanders claims many witnesses have seen the plain reddish trail left on the
aircraft's seats as something passed through the cabin forward of the
wings. He
also contends that all of the foam rubber from the backs of those seats
that had
the red stains had been mysteriously and purposely stripped away, but none
had ever been submitted for chemical analysis.

Interestingly, Comdr. Donaldson has suffered no harassment whatever for
his most active role in shining the spotlight on government blunders and
cover-ups. This is something he attributes to his extensive, unimpeachable
military record. Because of the multiple references and relationships he
maintains with fleet admirals and CINCPAC (Commander in Chief of Naval
Operations, Pacific) the "footprint" he lays down under that umbrella of
credibility is formidable enough that federal authorities apparently dare
not do
more than just wish he would go away. Others, such as Pierre Salinger and
James and Elizabeth Sanders, have not been so fortunate.

Richard Russell has had his share of government and media aggravation. He
told The WINDS that the FBI made multiple visits to his home attempting to
determine how he obtained that FAA radar tape--the same one they first
claimed was bogus; then admitted it was genuine.

Mr. Russell went on to make some very ominous statements in relation to
the strange manner in which the accident investigation was carried on.

When, according to Russell, the Airline Pilots Association representative,
whose name he declined to disclose, arrived on the scene of the Flight 800
crash, "he was greeted by 500 police officers, several hundred FBI agents and
twenty-three CIA agents."

"He went to the head APA official and asked, 'What the hell is going on
here?' The official said, 'I wondered how long it would take you to figure
this
out.'"

"Normally," Russell continued, "investigators will take their clipboards and
cameras out and record the scene. When any of the investigators attempted to
photograph the area the FBI would forbid it." The APA investigator told
Russell that there were as many as two to six agents shadowing every
investigator, watching every move they made. If one would closely examine a
piece of metal, for instance, and lay it down, it would disappear when the
investigator was not present.

"He also told me that if you would pick up a fragment and call another
investigator over to look at it with obvious interest, an FBI agent would come
over and take it out of your hands and you would never see it again.

"This information comes from somebody on the inside and I cannot reveal
their names to you, but this is what went on there."

Russell said he first got interested in the disaster when the Defense
Department got involved at the outset. "Why is the Pentagon making an
announcement of a civil airplane disaster?" Russell asked himself. "I couldn't
believe that."

"The second thing that occurred to me," Mr. Russell shared, "was why is the
military involving themselves in this immediately? Generally speaking, the
military is brought into an accident investigation only after the civil
authorities
are unable to do the job."

The NTSB is the chief authority in investigating aircraft accidents-- even
above the FBI which, to Russell, made a strange scenario even stranger. "The
night of the disaster the navy provided a DC-9 in Washington and loaded up
the FBI and the navy people--and even though there were seats available, they
would not allow the NTSB Go-Team to ride with them. They had to wait until
the next day. By that time the FBI had taken over and never relinquished
control.

"The most important data is the eyewitness reports. And they would not
even allow them to be interviewed by the NTSB people--only the FBI who
are not qualified to investigate accidents. But in this case they just
blundered
through with brute force and kept everyone at bay."

Any application of normal logic would clearly seem to indicate that this type
of activity portends far more than the government merely covering up the fact
of an errant missile strike.

Another observation can be made concerning the government's attempt to
conceal the truth from the American people and the world at large. Whenever
subterfuge is engaged and the government--or anyone for that
matter--contrives to deceive and cover up essential truth, a reaction takes
place where the truth appears to take on a life of its own. It will not be
buried
or obscured and the more one attempts to do so, the louder and more
obnoxious the truth becomes until, like Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart," the truth
just keeps beating louder until it must be acknowledged and its opponents
appear insane.

 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any
 thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.--Luke 8:17
