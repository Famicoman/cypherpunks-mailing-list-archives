&gt;Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Helicopter Harassment
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Freedom-Lovers International
&gt;&gt;Shonda P. Wigington, President
&gt;&gt;5308 Robinsdale Lane
&gt;&gt;Austin, Texas  78723
&gt;&gt;512-933-1950
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   OCTOBER 13, 1998--AUSTIN, TEXAS--On October 10, 1998, around noon, a
&gt;&gt;yellow and black helicopter flew around a South Austin neighborhood where
&gt;&gt;Alex Jones' mother lives.  Carol Jones reported that she did not pay
&gt;&gt;attention initially, but that it stayed in the area for about an hour.  She
&gt;&gt;observed the helicopter hovering over her property.  She said that the
&gt;&gt;words "Travis County" were printed on the side of the helicopter and that
&gt;&gt;the helicopter looked new. Someone was leaning out of the door of the
&gt;&gt;helicopter which she said was low enough for her to see that there was a
&gt;&gt;big lense camera pointed at her.
&gt;&gt;   When she returned into her home, she called her husband, Dr. David
&gt;&gt;Jones, who then called the Austin Aviation Department where he left a
&gt;&gt;message.  Simeon Tolgol returned the elder Mr. Jones' call the next
&gt;&gt;morning, explaining that the Travis County Sheriff's Department had logged
&gt;&gt;a four hour surveillance mission.  
&gt;&gt;   Around 2:00 AM that night, Alex Jones' girlfriend called Steve Lane of
&gt;&gt;"The Freedom Report" because of a helicopter shining spotlights into her
&gt;&gt;windows.  He stated to the Commissioners during Citizens Communication on
&gt;&gt;October 13, that the helicopter was so low that he could hear the noise
&gt;&gt;through the phone as he spoke to her.  She was frightened and crying.
&gt;&gt;   Jones' producer, Mike Hanson got film footage of the helicopter as it
&gt;&gt;moved over his home, shined the spotlight, turned it off, passed over, came
&gt;&gt;back, shined the light again several times. 
&gt;&gt;   "I was spotlighted by the helicopter very early saturday morning," Lane
&gt;&gt;said, "I believe it was about 1:30 to 2:00 am saturday morning. (The)
&gt;&gt;helicopter flew over, again, well under 800 feet above ground level, in
&gt;&gt;direct violation of the Federal Aviation Regulations, did not have a
&gt;&gt;spotlight on until it came to the house that I was at. The spotlight was
&gt;&gt;turned on, I have a video of it, and I'll be glad to give ya'll copies
&gt;&gt;because I would like for ya'll to look into this..."  Lane described the
&gt;&gt;incident as "unnerving".
&gt;&gt;   Mike Hanson called all of the County Commissioners for information
&gt;&gt;regarding the incident.  All of the Commissioners returned his call, that
&gt;&gt;is all accept Judge Bill Aleshire.
&gt;&gt;   Karen Sunleitner (Precinct 2 Commissioner) stated, "It was not the
&gt;&gt;Travis County Sheriff's office, it was the Austin Police Department.  The
&gt;&gt;Austin Police Department was piggy-backing on an existing flight that was
&gt;&gt;going on that particular day during the hours that Mr. Jones talked
&gt;&gt;about...were undergoing pilot training for the brand new helicopter.  They
&gt;&gt;piggy-backed on that.  They are doing ariel video footage of several
&gt;&gt;locations pertinent to ongoing homicide investigations."
&gt;&gt;   Several months ago Travis County Commissioners voted to buy the
&gt;&gt;helicopters at taxpayer expense, supposedly for Starflight assistance
&gt;&gt;during emergency situations.  But these particular helicopters were also
&gt;&gt;equipped with infrared "FLARE" technology that could easily be used for
&gt;&gt;surveillance.  
&gt;&gt;   The Texas Media Alliance was concerned that this technology could be
&gt;&gt;abused.  The different organizations that make up the Alliance voiced their
&gt;&gt;concerns to the commissioners, who adamently denied any such agenda for the
&gt;&gt;new helicopters.
&gt;&gt;   "They spoke to me like a child," Rusty Fields of Common Sense said, "and
&gt;&gt;they assured me that they would not use the helicopters for surveillance."
&gt;&gt;He looked around and gestured at the number of people in the room and said,
&gt;&gt;"This is what happens when they get caught lying."
&gt;&gt;   Alex Jones informed the commissioners that day that he was "conducting
&gt;&gt;an investigation."
&gt;&gt;He claims the county conducted a surveillance mission last week, denying
&gt;&gt;the county commissioners' claim that it was done by the city. 
&gt;&gt;   "You are all a pack of liars!" Jones stated, "Pure harassment. It's
&gt;&gt;SABER 1. You see, they passed it (the bill) under Starflight so everybody
&gt;&gt;can laugh and call it Starflight." Starflight being the term to use for
&gt;&gt;emergency pick-up missions by the local EMS.
&gt;&gt;Jones said he obtained the I-D of the people doing it through the Aviation
&gt;&gt;logues.
&gt;&gt;   "Flying over Alex's mothers house, I'm not buying that it was a homicide
&gt;&gt;investigation," said Mike Runyan, who had been there when the county
&gt;&gt;commissioners assured him by likening the use of the new helicopters to
&gt;&gt;"searching for lost children in the greenbelts."  Runyan commented that he
&gt;&gt;was not real happy about the video footage of the incident over Hanson's
&gt;&gt;house. 
&gt;&gt;   "Ya'll keep doing it," he warned, "and you're libel to provoke somebody.
&gt;&gt; It's just the natural progression of things."
&gt;&gt;   Mike Hanson played a tape-recorded interview of Mrs. Jones by Alex Jones
&gt;&gt;on his radio show, "The Real Spin," heard on KJFK 98.9FM (Austin).
&gt;&gt;   "I really still didn't know, or become paranoid or anything," she said,
&gt;&gt;"but these people made about eight passes over my place, maybe more, but
&gt;&gt;let's just say conservatively eight."
&gt;&gt;She stated that they were passing and "taking pictures."
&gt;&gt;   "I don't know what is more disturbing, that they would do this because,
&gt;&gt;like, I'm your mother," she told her son during the interview, "or that
&gt;&gt;they would just do it to somebody who's just sitting there, because this
&gt;&gt;person either has film of me or got really good pictures of just someone
&gt;&gt;looking straight up at him."
&gt;&gt;   "Are there any federal funds involved in these helicopters?" asked John
&gt;&gt;P. Roberts, when it came his turn to speak.
&gt;&gt;   "No, sir," Sunleitner stated.
&gt;&gt;   "There are no federal funds?" Roberts asked again, "So technically you
&gt;&gt;are not tied to them in any way if they want to come and 'borrow' them for
&gt;&gt;any reason?"
&gt;&gt;   "That is purchased by the taxpayers of Travis County," Sunleitner
&gt;&gt;assured him.
&gt;&gt;   Roberts closed his remarks with, "Common sense tells you you don't
&gt;&gt;harass the people that pay you."
&gt;&gt;   "The people will be informed," stated Shonda P. Wigington of
&gt;&gt;Freedom-Lovers International, "and if it (the harassment) doesn't stop, we
&gt;&gt;WILL strive for a class-action lawsuit against Travis County."
&gt;&gt;   During Citizens Communication that day, Darwin Mckees (Commissioner of
&gt;&gt;Precint 1) called in the Sheriff's Department as a result of a sit-in
&gt;&gt;attempt made by Free Press International's Greg Ericson in protest to the
&gt;&gt;three minute limit forced upon the people who came to speak that day.
&gt;&gt;Ericson left before the deputies arrived, and other than the Commissioners
&gt;&gt;trying to quieten Alex Jones's exclamations of what "liars" they are, there
&gt;&gt;were no other incidents.
