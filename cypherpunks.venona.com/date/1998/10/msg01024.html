That's cool man, I see your point.  Guess I shouldn't knock it when
I've only had one experience.  It's true, I got on the train quicker
than I've ever gotten on a flight and didn't face any harrassment. 
Actually, I faced more harrassment from my Gestapo math teacher in
high school trying to board a bus than getting on the train.  He
looked at me and told me I was trouble and searched every crevice of
my bag, personal being and space.  "But doctor, both your hands on my
shoulders. . ."you get the point and that's exactly what's happening
to us each and every day.

&gt; I've taken that same route, except up 
&gt; to no. Vermont rather than RI,
&gt; 
&gt; I travelled anonymously, for an extra 50 bux, 
&gt; I had my own little private cabin, I was never
&gt; searched, my bags were never xrayed by incompetent
&gt; androids, was able to find company from the 
&gt; hordes that you describe to sit with me in my
&gt; lil cabin and spend some time (wink wink, nudge
&gt; nudge) and so forth. 
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, an entire day spent with a whole pile of 
&gt; folks can really be a horrible drag, and I'm
&gt; told that travelling on the weekends thats
&gt; what you can expect. 
&gt; 
&gt; But, shuffling in and out of Polizei Central, 
&gt; subjecting myself to xrays and potential 
&gt; cavity searches, showing ID to every bone
&gt; head that demands it, just seems a little
&gt; too kyrstalnachtish for my taste, I don't care
&gt; if I EVER fly again. 
&gt; 
&gt; Its easier, less hassle, more anonymous to
&gt; travel by train than it is to drive, or
&gt; for that matter, walk.
&gt; 
&gt; yes, its VERY easy for the SS
&gt; to stop and search a train, but the plane 
&gt; is a forgone situation. By entering an
&gt; airport, you've already consented to be
&gt; stripped of nearly every right you thought
&gt; you may have had.
&gt; 
&gt; I had an experience like you describe travelling
&gt; from Atlanta to DC by bus once when a young-un. 
&gt; I too, swore I'd never do it again, and I didn't,
&gt; not till I mustered out of the military and they
&gt; stuck me on a 10 hr busride to the nearest
&gt; depot to go home, and yes, I still hated it.
&gt; 
&gt; to each his own, 
&gt; 
&gt; take care

&gt; &gt; I traveled by train all the way to Florida from Rhode Island once.
 24
&gt; &gt; hours straight it took man and I swore I would never do it again. 
&gt; &gt; 40-50 people per car and basically one bathroom per car.  Come
morning
&gt; &gt; time man, the lines for the bathrooms stretched out of the cars. 
&gt; &gt; Screw that, I could have flown and made it in 3 hours. Plus it's
&gt; &gt; easier for the gov't to stop trains and search them, I'd rather go
&gt; &gt; with the flight.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Where possible, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; fuk a bunch of airlines anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Travel by train is a lot more enjoyable, relaxing, fun.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Folks that travel by train could fly, but would
&gt; &gt; &gt; preferr to enjoy the ride, cause it ain't no cheaper, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; except, !!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can pay with cash and show no id and go
&gt; &gt; &gt; where you would like in the lower 48.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This last one is too funny to not use.  I don't have a
subpoena,
&gt; &gt; but I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;just see myself writing back explaining this and requesting
&gt; &gt; assistance with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a plane flight to solve this problem.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually you don't need state id to fly, legally.  But the
&gt; &gt; airlines will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hassle you and not put your bags aboard til you are.  There
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are references on the net to flying without state id.
