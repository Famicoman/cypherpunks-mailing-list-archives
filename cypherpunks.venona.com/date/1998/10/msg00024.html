Dear Friend,


I want to share this with you, I am sure like me you have tried many
different opportunities at home and most of them don't work, or they want
more money than we can afford. I figured what's $5 when we have spent so
much more.....

Need some fast cash? Try this:

*******************************************************************
If you are prepared to read on, BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED...YOU
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

*******************************************************************
Read the following and you will agree this is a very exciting
opportunity. Only invest a little bit of time and your reward could
mean thousands of dollars! Good luck!

*********************************************************************

$$$ ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY? RIGHT NOW? $$$
$$$ HOW DOES US$10,000 IN TWO(2) WEEKS (or less) SOUND? $$$

Don't laugh! This a very logical and rewarding opportunity! 
One(1) hour of work to get started and NO MAILING LISTS!

--------Esquire Marketing Newsletter Gift Club--------

*********************************************************************

If you need to make a few thousand dollars REALLY FAST, then please take
a moment to read this simple program I am sharing with you. No, it is
NOT what you think! YOU DO NOT have to send $5.00 to five people to buy
a report, buy a recipe, or any other product. Nor will you need to
invest more money later to get things going. THIS IS THE FASTEST,
EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO! Complete it in ONE HOUR and you will
never forget the day you first received it. 

--------This Is How It Works--------

Unlike many other programs, this three-level program is more realistic
and much, much faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate for this
program is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST, and you will see results in two
weeks or less! Just in time for next month's bills!

You only mail out 20 copies ( not 200 or more as in other programs). You
should also try to send them to PEOPLE WHO SEND YOU THEIR PROGRAMS
because they know THESE PROGRAMS WORK and they are already believers
in the system! Besides, this program is much, much FASTER and has a HIGHER
RESPONSE RATE.

Even if you are already in a similar program, STAY WITH IT, but do yourself a
favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and takes
a very small investment. It will pay off long before other letters even
begin to trickle in!

Just give ONE person a US $5.00 gift. That' s all!

Follow the simple instructions and in TWO WEEKS you will have US $10,000
in your bank account!!! Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH
PROFIT POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE. JUST
ONE (1) US$5.00 BILL. THAT'S YOUR INVESTMENT!

+------+ Follow These Simple Instructions +------+

1. On a blank sheet of paper write "Please add me to your mailing list."
Write your name and address clearly and include your Email address (if
you have one) for future mailings and courtesy follow ups. Fold it
around a US $5 bill and send this to the FIRST name on the list (#1).
Only the FIRST PERSON on the list gets YOUR NAME AND A FIVE DOLLAR
GIFT.

Note: This is a service and is 100% legal (Refer to US Postal &amp; Lottery
Laws, Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the
US Code, also in the Code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections
255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged
for money received.")

2. Retype the list ONLY, REMOVING the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE LIST.
Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the
THIRD(#3) position.

3. Send out 20 copies of this letter. Note: By sending this letter via
Email, the response time is much faster and you save the expense of
envelopes, stamps, and copying services. Consider this, MILLIONS of
people "surf the Internet" everyday, all day, all over the World! FIFTY
THOUSAND new people get on the Internet every month! An excellent
source of names is the people who send you other programs, and the names
listed on the letter they send you. Your contact source is UNLIMITED.
It boggles my mind to think of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I
say Email, your letter TODAY! It's so easy,
ONE HOUR of your time. THAT'S IT!

To send your newsletter by Email:

1. Go to "Edit" and "Select All"
2. Go to "Edit" and "Copy"
3. Start (compose) a new Email message
4. Address your Email and Subject Blocks
5. Go to "Edit" and "Paste"

After you have pasted this article in your new Email, delete the old
header and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, Etc..). Now you can edit
the names and addresses with ease. I recommend deleting the top name,
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply
changing the numbers.

THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO DO. When your name reaches the first position
in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your gifts. The gifts
will be sent to you by 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself, who are
willing to invest US$5.00 and one hour to receive US$10,000 in cash.
That s all! There will be a total of US$10,000 (or more) in US$5.00
bills in your mailbox in two weeks.
US$10,000 for an hour's work! I think it s WORTH IT, don t you?

GO AHEAD -- TRY IT. IT'S US$5.00! EVEN IF YOU JUST MAKE 3 OR 4
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?! IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY!!!!

--------TRUE STORY--------

Cindy Allen writes: I ran this gift summation four times last year.
The first time I received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks and
over $10,000 in cash in the next three times I ran it. I can't begin to
tell you how great it feels not to have to worry about money anymore!
I thank God for the day I received this letter! It has truly changed my
life! Don t be afraid to make gifts to strangers, they’ll come back to
you ten-fold. So, let's keep it going and help each other in these "tough
and uncertain times."

Many of us just want to pay off our bills, buy a new car or buy a new
home for our family. Whatever your reasons or needs are, this program
worked for Cindy and thousands of others (just like you and I) time and
time again! THIS PROGRAM CAN AND WILL WORK FOR YOU!!!

--------Can I Do It Again? --------

OF COURSE YOU CAN...This plan is structured for everyone to send only
twenty(20) letters each. However, you are certainly not limited to
twenty. Mail out as many as you can. Every twenty letters you send has
a return to you of $10,000 or more. If you can mail forty, sixty,
eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT, THE MORE YOU
GET OUT OF IT!

Each time you run this program, just follow the steps (1) through (3)
and everyone on your gift list benefits! Simple enough? You bet it is!
Besides, there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), no further
trips to the printer or copiers, and you can do it again and again with
your regular group of gifters, or start up a new group. Some people
produce a mailing list of opportunity seekers and send out 200 or more.
Why not? It beats working! Each time you receive a MLM offer in the
mail, respond with THIS letter! Your name will climb to the number one
position at dizzying geometric rates.

Follow the simple instructions and above all, please "PLAY FAIR."

That's the key to this program's success. Your name must run the "full
gamut" on the list to produce the end results. "Sneaking" your name
higher up on the list WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it
only cheats the other people who have worked hard and earned the right
to be there. So please, play by the rules and the $$,$$$ will come to
you!!!

--------Mail Your Letters Out Today--------

$$$ TOGETHER, WE WILL ALL PROSPER $$$

Mail your US$5.00 "Gift" to the first name on the list ONLY. Remove the
first name and move the other two up one place and put your name in the
#3 position.

GOOD LUCK!!!
