&gt; 			Profile of Tim May, President of Tim May Investigations
&gt;
&gt; 			"The sensitive nature of investigative services is reflected
&gt;in the attitude we promote. While 			discretion and
&gt;confidentiality are our highest priorities, we place great importance on
&gt;providing 			you with expert and concise counseling and
&gt;impartial documentation." --Tim May
&gt;
&gt; 	Mr. May currently serves as a Judge for Probate Court
&gt;
&gt; Senior investigator/explosive technician with the Office of the State
&gt;Fire Marshall of Maryland 			from 1974-1983. Prior to that, Mr.
&gt;May served as a police officer and Police Chief in Maryland.
&gt;
&gt; Former Department Chairman of the Arson Mitigation Division at the
&gt;National Fire Academy.
&gt;
&gt; Consultant and Instructor to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, &amp; Firearms
&gt;(ATF), Federal Bureau 			of Investigation (F.B.I.), and expert
&gt;witness for U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney.
&gt;
&gt; Mr. May has testified as an expert on arson, explosives, hazardous
&gt;materials, criminal and civil 			investigations, and is
&gt;qualified in District, Circuit, and Federal Courts, as well as
&gt;International Courts.
&gt;
&gt; Successful completion of several high profile national cases has earned
&gt;world-wide recognition, 			providing contracts with foreign
&gt;governments and corporations.
&gt;
&gt; Adjunct member and lecturer to several state universities, colleges, and
&gt;associations.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 			 Investigative Services
&gt;
&gt; 			Our associates are selected and employed by us because they
&gt;have a proven record based on a 			successful balance of
&gt;technical experience and personal characteristics. Each member of our
&gt;staff 			has undergone extensive training in all aspects of
&gt;investigative methodology. These skills and 			procedures are
&gt;constantly updated as the rules of evidence and judicial requirements
&gt;undergo 			revisions at local and national levels. Our ability to
&gt;work closely with clients and their legal 			representatives has
&gt;earned us an outstanding reputation nationally.
&gt;
&gt; 			In the 90's, investigative services are a $400 billion
&gt;dollar a year industry. An ever-increasing 			number of
&gt;individuals, businesses, and organizations are utilizing their legal
&gt;rights to increase 			security and gain piece of mind. Quality
&gt;investigative services can protect you from losing money 			in
&gt;lawsuits and damages claims, and even recover losses you may have
&gt;experienced.
&gt;
&gt; Exercise your right to know!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 			Why Consider Investigation?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 57% of all U.S. businesses use an investigative agency to verify they are
&gt;hiring the right employee:
&gt; 			credentials, drug screening, criminal records, employment
&gt;history, and past violent behavior.
&gt; You have a FEDERAL RIGHT to know who you are hiring and/or contracting
&gt;with.
&gt; 30-40 million people (1/3 - 1/4 of the workforce) have a criminal record
&gt;according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
&gt; YOU can be liable for NOT conducting background checks in certain
&gt;situations.
&gt; YOU can be liable for negligent hiring and retention, and for allowing
&gt;some conditions such as sexual harassment or stalking to occur unreported.
&gt;
&gt; 65%-75% of all merchandise losses were the result of employee theft.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 			Why take chances...Call Now! 301 695-2662
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 			We offer affordable rates...
&gt;
&gt; 			Like everything else, there is a wide-range of fees charged
&gt;in the service-provider market. We 			recognize that each
&gt;client has unique requirements - whether they are of a security,
&gt;protective, or 			investigative nature, or a combination of
&gt;each.
&gt;
&gt; 			Since our first goal is to understand your needs, you will
&gt;only pay for actual services provided - as 			discussed. Our fee
&gt;schedule is based on time, personnel involved, degree of technical and
&gt;		supervisory support, and the extent of case preparation, where
&gt;necessary.
&gt;
&gt; 			The projected cost is provided after a FREE initial
&gt;consultation. We believe this approach allows 			the maximum
&gt;degree of confidence and peace of mind.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 			Your Full Service Agency. . .
