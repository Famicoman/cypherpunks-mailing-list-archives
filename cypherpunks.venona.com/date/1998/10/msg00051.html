&gt;THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY 
&gt;Clinton's secret war games 
&gt;He's scheming for strike to make him international hero 
&gt;                  
&gt;
&gt;This is the first of a two-part series on the
&gt;revelations of military computer expert Curt Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;By David M. Bresnahan 
&gt;Copyright 1998, WorldNetDaily.com 
&gt;
&gt;President Bill Clinton is playing war games
&gt;on a top secret computer to come up with a
&gt;way to be an international hero, according to
&gt;the man who designed the system. 
&gt;
&gt;According to Rev. Curt Tomlin, a former
&gt;member of the battle staff of both presidents
&gt;John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson,
&gt;Clinton is a desperate man who is like an
&gt;animal trapped in a corner. He will do
&gt;anything to regain his credibility and deflect
&gt;criticism from his impending impeachment
&gt;hearings, he says. He also is driven by his
&gt;desire to create a positive legacy of his time in
&gt;the White House, according to various
&gt;reports. 
&gt;
&gt;Clinton's motivations are dangerous to the
&gt;security of our nation, according to Tomlin. It
&gt;was Tomlin who designed and perfected the
&gt;Pentagon's first war games computer system,
&gt;the top secret "Single Integrated Operating Procedure." 
&gt;
&gt;The "SIOP" computer is a method of targeting
&gt;a military attack and evaluating the most
&gt;likely response to that attack, according to
&gt;Tomlin. Highly classified intelligence
&gt;information is gathered from all over the
&gt;world by the CIA and other sources, placed in
&gt;the computer, and then accessed by Clinton to
&gt;play his own personal war games. 
&gt;
&gt;"The decisions he's making right now are
&gt;totally illogical and irresponsible," Tomlin
&gt;told WorldNetDaily in an exclusive interview.
&gt;"Looking at the power and everything he's got
&gt;at his finger tips. That's a dangerous situation
&gt;for a spastic individual." 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin has maintained silence about the top
&gt;secret program for many years. He has been
&gt;called out of retirement three times and has
&gt;served in the Navy, Air Force, and Army for a
&gt;combined total of just over 24 years. He has
&gt;also been hired by government contractors to
&gt;assist in computer intelligence systems
&gt;designed to improve security for military
&gt;computer systems. 
&gt;
&gt;"I could be sticking my neck on the chopping
&gt;block for a number of reasons," said Tomlin of
&gt;his decision to make his information public.
&gt;"Number one is, I'm still under some lifetime
&gt;restrictions on security clearances. For
&gt;example two of the clearances I had above top
&gt;secret was ESI and category 7 and 9. That was
&gt;three above that. Those are lifetime. So I have
&gt;to be a little bit careful about what I put in
&gt;print. I think people have to be aware of this,
&gt;regardless of the consequences on my end. I
&gt;feel that I would be guilty of the military
&gt;crime of negligence of duty if I did not bring
&gt;this to somebody's attention," explained
&gt;Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;Clinton had tried to become an international
&gt;hero by destroying hundreds of terrorists
&gt;being trained by Osama bin Laden in
&gt;Afghanistan and a chemical weapons plant in
&gt;Sudan. Those two missile attacks were chosen
&gt;through use of the SIOP computer to which
&gt;Clinton has access, according to Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;The computer predicted the result of the
&gt;attacks would bring about the death of
&gt;hundreds of terrorist forces and eliminate a
&gt;chemical weapons factory. Someone
&gt;intervened to change the results, according to
&gt;an intelligence source who spoke only on
&gt;condition of anonymity. 
&gt;
&gt;Reports in European newspapers after the
&gt;attacks by Clinton corroborate what that
&gt;source claimed. "There were no dead
&gt;terrorists, and the chemical weapons plant
&gt;was an innocent pharmaceutical plant. Instead
&gt;of being a hero, Clinton is an international
&gt;laughing stock. The terrorists were tipped off
&gt;and cleared the area. The real chemical
&gt;weapons plant was two miles away. It was a
&gt;combination of bad intelligence and
&gt;purposeful intervention," said the source. 
&gt;
&gt;Clinton has been searching the SIOP system
&gt;ever since the failure in an effort to find
&gt;another opportunity to prove himself to the
&gt;world and become the international hero he
&gt;envisions for his legacy, according to the
&gt;source. Tomlin agrees. 
&gt;
&gt;"There's no choice. He's either going to sink or
&gt;try again. We can look for some very
&gt;unpleasant responses, depending on the
&gt;target he chooses," says Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;When Clinton actually succeeds at inflicting
&gt;damage to a group of international terrorists,
&gt;many experts believe there will be swift and
&gt;deadly retaliation. Americans are in danger of
&gt;massive chemical and biological attacks in
&gt;major metropolitan areas, as well as similar
&gt;attacks on large military bases. 
&gt;Tomlin says he is personally aware of
&gt;unprotected water supplies to domestic
&gt;military bases that could provide terrorists an
&gt;opportunity to poison the drinking water
&gt;used by most of the nation's military. 
&gt;"When you contaminate a water supply ...
&gt;that's almost beyond my comprehension," he
&gt;remarked. The open borders of the United
&gt;States make it a simple process for terrorists
&gt;to come into the country and bring their
&gt;weapons of mass destruction with them
&gt;without detection," he says. "They can come
&gt;and go as they please with any kind of cargo.
&gt;That border is literally wide open, regardless
&gt;of what INS tells you," warned Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin believes there are many terrorist
&gt;agents already located in the United States
&gt;waiting for orders to strike. Other sources
&gt;have independently confirmed that claim but
&gt;were unwilling to be identified. 
&gt;
&gt;"There's no doubt that the U.S. is currently in
&gt;the greatest danger of massive domestic
&gt;attack from an external enemy than ever
&gt;before in our nation's history," agreed one
&gt;intelligence source who is equally concerned
&gt;about Clinton pushing such terrorists to the
&gt;point to massive retaliation. "They just need
&gt;an excuse," he said. 
&gt;
&gt;"Of course, the president has available to him
&gt;an awesome military force that he can use to
&gt;launch a first strike on any target in the
&gt;world," explained Tomlin of the top secret
&gt;system available to Clinton. "One of the things
&gt;I have been real concerned about recently is
&gt;the type of response that we can expect from
&gt;these various targets that the president can
&gt;choose from. For example, if he chose to hit
&gt;target A, the computer system would come
&gt;back and tell him what kind of response he
&gt;can expect. Will that response be in the nature
&gt;of an explosive response like blowing up an
&gt;embassy? Will it be in the form of a chemical
&gt;or biological response, or a combination of the
&gt;two? And it will also tell him, will the
&gt;response be a psychological or political
&gt;response, or a combination of any of these? In
&gt;other words, the system will come back and
&gt;tell him exactly what he can expect the owners
&gt;of that target to do in retaliation," explained
&gt;Tomlin, the father of that real-life computer
&gt;war game. 
&gt;
&gt;"We got an awful lot of our information
&gt;through CIA on site sources where these
&gt;various targets were located," Tomlin says.
&gt;"We could tell you anything you wanted to
&gt;know about that target. How thick the walls
&gt;were, if it were a structure, how far under
&gt;ground it goes. How many megatons of
&gt;explosives it would take to wipe it out totally,
&gt;or give you 50 percent destruction, or 75
&gt;percent destruction. We could just tell you
&gt;anything you wanted to know about that
&gt;target." 
&gt;The highly advanced computer system as
&gt;well as the automated launch and attack
&gt;systems enable Clinton to initiate an attack
&gt;without the knowledge of very many other
&gt;individuals. Such decisions could be made by
&gt;Clinton alone, or with just a few political
&gt;advisers. Military and security advisers could
&gt;be left in the dark. 
&gt;
&gt;"That's what bothers me today," says Tomlin.
&gt;"Given the fact that the man in the White
&gt;House now has his finger on the trigger, and
&gt;he can launch those forces which still consist
&gt;of atomic warheads on any intercontinental
&gt;ballistic missile. He can create a situation that
&gt;could be very detrimental to this country.
&gt;There are certain things that I'm really
&gt;concerned about at this point in time
&gt;concerning the highly probable responses that
&gt;the president can expect as the result of
&gt;striking certain targets." 
&gt;
&gt;With SIOP, Clinton can sit at his private
&gt;computer and play war games until he finds
&gt;the situation he likes best. He can literally
&gt;type in various attacks around the world and
&gt;the SIOP computer will tell him what will be
&gt;the likely results of such an attack. With the
&gt;push of a button he can turn the computer
&gt;simulation he likes best into reality. 
&gt;
&gt;"The ones I am concerned about now is the
&gt;possibility of a chemical or biological
&gt;response to a specific strike that he would
&gt;initiate," said Tomlin of his fear. "Simply
&gt;because an explosive response is limited in
&gt;scope. It's a token. It's a warning. But when
&gt;you drop a very small amount of biological or
&gt;chemical agents into the water supply of a
&gt;large city of Dallas or Houston, my friend, we
&gt;have a problem in that area. You can bring
&gt;these agents through customs on our southern
&gt;border almost undetected. There's just very
&gt;little possibility of these things being detected
&gt;coming through Customs or just walking
&gt;across the border in a deserted area." 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin created the SIOP computer back in
&gt;1963 when he served on the Kennedy battle
&gt;staff. He continued to serve on the Johnson
&gt;battle staff as well. Since then he has helped
&gt;the military work on numerous top secret
&gt;defense projects and information systems. 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin did his work in the top secret
&gt;underground "site R," as well as in the
&gt;Pentagon war room. His work was considered
&gt;so critical that he had a 24-hour armed Marine
&gt;guard watching over him. 
&gt;
&gt;Although Tomlin is now retired, he still lives
&gt;by Fort Hood in Texas and has many
&gt;neighbors who are current and former
&gt;military. He claims there are many who are
&gt;getting out of the service because of Clinton. 
&gt;
&gt;"Unfortunately," says Tomlin, "that's the
&gt;sentiment that is running rampant among
&gt;military people in this area. If you cannot
&gt;trust your leader, then we have a problem.
&gt;This man cannot be trusted. They are
&gt;deserting (their careers). I'm talking about our
&gt;combat experienced veterans. They're giving
&gt;up 18 years, 17 years and so forth and getting
&gt;out because they can no longer trust their
&gt;leader. They don't want to be a part of what he
&gt;might create." 
&gt;Tomlin expects Clinton to launch an attack
&gt;very soon that will bring devastating
&gt;domestic retaliation to the U.S. 
&gt;"If I were still on active duty, either as an
&gt;enlisted man or as a commissioned officer,
&gt;knowing what I know now, looking at all of
&gt;the information I have available to me, I
&gt;would have no choice but to resign my
&gt;commission or terminate my enlistment
&gt;simply because there is no way that I could
&gt;now trust my commander in chief," said Tomlin.

&gt;THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY 
&gt;Clinton's secret war games -- part 2 
&gt;He has the power to disable electronics
&gt;anywhere in the world 
&gt;                  
&gt;This is the second of a two-part series on Clinton's secret
&gt;war games and the concerns of the man who helped invent
&gt;them. 
&gt;
&gt;By David M. Bresnahan 
&gt;Copyright 1998, WorldNetDaily.com 
&gt;We are living in a new age of electronic warfare
&gt;which could make every electrical device from
&gt;military tanks to clock radios inoperative, according
&gt;to one of the people responsible for such weapons
&gt;systems. 
&gt;
&gt;President Bill Clinton could enter a few key strokes
&gt;on a computer and selectively disable all electronics
&gt;anywhere in the world, including within the U.S.,
&gt;using a top secret satellite system known as "LEO."
&gt;That ability is not unique to the U.S., however. Other
&gt;countries and even terrorists could knock out
&gt;electronics equipment anywhere in the world. 
&gt;
&gt;Rev. Curt Tomlin, 65, is a retired Army major with 24
&gt;years combined service in the Navy, Air Force, and
&gt;Army. He was a member of the battle staff for the
&gt;Kennedy and Johnson administrations and
&gt;developed top secret computer systems for the
&gt;Pentagon. His unique expertise prompted the
&gt;military to bring him out of retirement three times to
&gt;put his skills to use in the development of war
&gt;games computers, security computer systems and
&gt;the testing of electronics warfare. 
&gt;Tomlin gave an exclusive interview to
&gt;WorldNetDaily to express his concerns about
&gt;national security. He says the U.S. is in grave danger
&gt;because of a president who is desperate to hang on
&gt;to his position of power at all cost. 
&gt;
&gt;In an exclusive WorldNetDaily article yesterday,
&gt;Tomlin detailed his fears that Clinton is using a war
&gt;games computer to find a new target he can attack.
&gt;Clinton's goal, according to Tomlin, is to become an
&gt;international hero. Tomlin, who created the nation's
&gt;first computer war game system, known as "SIOP,"
&gt;for the Pentagon, fears that Clinton's actions will
&gt;bring devastating retaliation from terrorists who are
&gt;just waiting for an excuse to activate their plan of
&gt;domestic attack against the U.S. 
&gt;
&gt;Although Tomlin believes the greatest danger to the
&gt;U.S. is from biological and chemical weapons, he is
&gt;also concerned about electronic warfare. Tomlin
&gt;believes Clinton is very upset with a large portion of
&gt;the nation that wants him impeached. He says
&gt;Clinton is planning a way to get back at his enemies
&gt;in a big way. 
&gt;
&gt;"This man (Clinton) is extremely vindictive and he's
&gt;going to get back at the country one way or another,"
&gt;said Tomlin, who is also concerned about Clinton's
&gt;recent attempt to use the SIOP computer to attack
&gt;alleged terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan.
&gt;Tomlin believes new attacks are imminent in order
&gt;to turn the previous failure to damage the terrorists
&gt;into a major victory that will make Clinton an
&gt;international hero. 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin expects domestic retaliation from the next
&gt;attack by Clinton to be devastating. He says terrorists
&gt;are already in the U.S. awaiting orders to attack, a
&gt;claim supported by a recently intercepted fax sent
&gt;world wide to 5,000 "soldiers" loyal to Osama bin
&gt;Laden. The faxed order, reported in London and
&gt;Jerusalem newspapers recently, tells the terrorists to
&gt;be prepared to attack U.S. and Israel in four ways
&gt;very soon. 
&gt;According to the fax, the attacks would be designed to 
&gt;
&gt;Bring commercial airlines to a halt 
&gt;Stop all maritime traffic 
&gt;Occupy U.S. embassies around the world 
&gt;Shut down U.S. banking 
&gt;
&gt;Such actions would seem difficult to achieve, but
&gt;Tomlin says it would actually be easy to accomplish
&gt;with access to electronics warfare devices. Although
&gt;his greatest concern is chemical or biological attack,
&gt;he said he would not be surprised if the attack came
&gt;through electronics. Virtually everything from
&gt;military aircraft to TV remotes would be disabled,
&gt;according to Tomlin. 
&gt;Tomlin was called out of retirement in 1995 to
&gt;participate in a top secret project. He worked in the
&gt;10th Mountain Division as a senior test plan analyst. 
&gt;
&gt;"You know that your automobile has an electronic
&gt;ignition in it," explained Tomlin. "It also has a
&gt;computer inside that. Did you know that we can
&gt;immobilize every moving vehicle in this country
&gt;with a few key strokes of a computer, all at the same
&gt;time? 
&gt;
&gt;"By using the LEO satellites," he described, "you can
&gt;disrupt the computers. You can stop that electronic
&gt;ignition. It's all electronically based. You can
&gt;interfere with it and stop it dead in it's tracks." 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin also worked on tests dealing with laser
&gt;technology and the global positioning system, but he
&gt;did not provide details of those tests or their
&gt;purpose. He did say the testing was extensive and
&gt;was all for military purposes. 
&gt;It is clear that China and other countries have this
&gt;same technology, agreed Tomlin. He believes the
&gt;recent intercepted bin Laden fax is evidence that
&gt;terrorists have this same ability. Electronic warfare
&gt;would make all four of the stated goals easily attainable. 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin is risking legal action by the Pentagon for
&gt;revealing top secret information. That's a risk he says
&gt;he is willing to take because of the danger he
&gt;believes has been caused by an out-of-control president. 
&gt;
&gt;"The decisions he's making right now are totally
&gt;illogical and irresponsible," said Tomlin about his
&gt;concerns regarding Clinton. "Looking at the power
&gt;and everything he's got at his finger tips. That's a
&gt;dangerous situation for a spastic individual." Tomlin
&gt;has maintained silence about the top secret program
&gt;for many years, but now he feels compelled to speak
&gt;out. 
&gt;
&gt;"I could be sticking my neck on the chopping block
&gt;for a number of reasons," said Tomlin of his decision
&gt;to make his information public. "Number one is I'm
&gt;still under some lifetime restrictions on security
&gt;clearances. For example two of the clearances I had
&gt;above top secret was ESI and category 7 and 9. That
&gt;was three above that. Those are lifetime. So I have to
&gt;be a little bit careful about what I put in print. 
&gt;"I think people have to be aware of this, regardless of
&gt;the consequences on my end. I feel that I would be
&gt;guilty of the military crime of negligence of duty if I
&gt;did not bring this to somebody's attention,"
&gt;explained Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;Is this all part of a planned conspiracy? Or is this a
&gt;president gone mad? Tomlin said he would not be
&gt;surprised by either scenario. 
&gt;
&gt;"If that's the way it turns out, I will not be at all
&gt;surprised," he said. "When you put all of the pieces
&gt;of the puzzle together you see how it all fits together.
&gt;
&gt;"The ultimate end product of these programs the
&gt;government has been working on is to create a
&gt;generation of people who will readily accept sudden
&gt;and radical change without question, without
&gt;objection, and without opposition. That's the goal of
&gt;these programs in a nutshell. This is headed toward
&gt;a one-world government without any question
&gt;what-so-ever, he warns. These programs have been
&gt;going on for a long time. People need to pay
&gt;attention to what Outcome-Based Education is all
&gt;about, what Goals 2000 is all about, and these other
&gt;socialistic programs that are leading in this direction.
&gt;It's upon us," warned Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;In recent years Tomlin has been teaching and writing
&gt;college courses dealing with electronic data
&gt;processing. He tells his students, "If you can think of
&gt;it, you can do it. Your only limitation is your own
&gt;imagination. There are no limitations when it comes
&gt;to electronics. 
&gt;
&gt;"Y2K is going to be one of the biggest problems
&gt;you've ever seen in your life, coupled with the other
&gt;intentional (electronic) interferences we're talking
&gt;about." 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin says he entered a Navy competition back in
&gt;1963 for a mystery computer assignment. After two
&gt;weeks of competition with many others who wanted
&gt;the top secret, undisclosed position, Tomlin was
&gt;notified to pack his bags and report to the Pentagon. 
&gt;"I had no idea what I would be doing until I walked
&gt;into the front door. I had to compete for that job. At
&gt;that time there were 700 of us in the Navy who had
&gt;shown specific talent and progress for designing
&gt;information and processing systems. That was Navy
&gt;wide because data processing was so new at that
&gt;time," explained Tomlin. 
&gt;
&gt;"There was three places we worked out of. Site R,
&gt;which was the underground command post, the war
&gt;room in the Pentagon -- the JCS war room. We also
&gt;had a facility on the North Hampton, which was a
&gt;light cruiser. That was also the Presidents alternate
&gt;battle site on that cruiser. Later we also had a facility
&gt;on the U.S. Wright, which was a converted jeep
&gt;carrier from World War II." 
&gt;
&gt;When he first arrived he was the youngest, 30, and
&gt;lowest ranked, petty officer, member of the Kennedy
&gt;battle staff. No one on the team knew just what they
&gt;wanted or expected from Tomlin, so he just observed
&gt;and tried to find ways to put his skills to use. 
&gt;
&gt;"Nobody on the battle team was capable of telling
&gt;me what they wanted me to do," he said. "So I
&gt;iddled around there for a couple of weeks just
&gt;watching what the rest of the battle staff did during
&gt;their exercises and their presidential briefings and
&gt;stuff like that. Kind of with my hands in my pockets.
&gt;We had a worldwide battle exercise and I wandered
&gt;around the war room and watched them post the
&gt;status boards, the maps, and process the 'twixes' as
&gt;we called them back then. That's all the messages
&gt;and the strikes and the targets. Finally, I concluded
&gt;that these guys were doing this the hard way." 
&gt;Tomlin, accompanied by his armed Marine guard
&gt;who was with him 24 hours a day, went to work in
&gt;the seclusion of his underground war room at site R.
&gt;He began putting together some very simple
&gt;procedures using IBM punch cards on the latest and
&gt;greatest computer 1963 technology had to offer.
&gt;Within just a few weeks another war game was
&gt;called and Tomlin was ready to show off his
&gt;creation, which he created totally on his own. 
&gt;
&gt;"We had a war game, and while they were doing
&gt;heir thing out there, nobody paid any attention to
&gt;me and nobody knew I was around. So I went back
&gt;and I got copies of all the incoming data and I did
&gt;my thing and I threw my shoulders back one day
&gt;and just started posting the status boards and
&gt;everybody else -- all these lieutenant colonels and
&gt;colonels and brigadier generals and everybody else
&gt;-- were all gathered around the conference table and
&gt;somebody said, 'Tomlin what the hell are you
&gt;doing?' I said, 'Well, I'm plotting the results of these
&gt;various strikes.' And they said, 'Who told you to do
&gt;that?' I said, 'Nobody did.' 
&gt;
&gt;"They got to looking at their conclusions and my
&gt;conclusions and they were identical. What took 30 or
&gt;40 folks for them to do, well I did it by myself in just
&gt;a matter of minutes," described Tomlin of his first
&gt;war games computer program. So that got their
&gt;attention, and that's where everything started. So the
&gt;next time around they used my computerized war
&gt;game, which was the first one the Department of
&gt;Defense ever had. Then later I got tasked to build a
&gt;system for the targets, and then the rate of
&gt;production for atomic weapons storage and
&gt;accountability, and all that good stuff. It just kind of
&gt;exploded (military computer assignments) from
&gt;there." 
&gt;
&gt;The military had never called retirees back into
&gt;full-time active duty until they needed Tomlin
&gt;during the Gulf War. They needed him and didn't
&gt;have a policy in place that enabled them to bring him
&gt;back, pay him, and give him credit towards his
&gt;retirement benefits. 
&gt;Tomlin is listed as a military resource with critical
&gt;skills, so the government made the necessary
&gt;changes in policy and got him back for a full year of
&gt;service. During that time he worked in the national
&gt;records center in St. Louis, MO, to install new
&gt;computer systems and redesign internal security for
&gt;6.9 million records. The commercial company he
&gt;worked with to accomplish the task is owned by
&gt;Ross Perot, he pointed out. 
&gt;As the pioneer of computerized war games, and
&gt;other information systems, Tomlin is obviously
&gt;proud of his work. He is speaking out because he
&gt;believes Clinton is a desperate man trying to save his
&gt;position of power at any cost. He believes Clinton is
&gt;not acting rationally and is about to subject the U.S.
&gt;to grave danger from international terrorists. Tomlin
&gt;says he is willing to accept the personal risk he is
&gt;taking by revealing sensitive information about
&gt;military systems and capabilities. 
&gt;
&gt;Tomlin, is now a minister, and is the director of the
&gt;Christian Alert Network. He devotes his time to
&gt;informing pastors and concerned Christians of
&gt;problems he sees in government schools. He actively
&gt;promotes home schooling, private schools and
&gt;reform of public schools, which he says are being
&gt;used by the government to manipulate the beliefs of
&gt;children and take away parental rights. 
&gt;
&gt;"The primary purpose of the Christian Alert Network
&gt;(TCAN)," states his web page, "is to inform
&gt;individual Christian citizens on specific situations
&gt;that adversely impact upon our basic Christian
&gt;doctrine, religious freedom and traditional families
&gt;and to encourage them to participate in the
&gt;governmental process, in obedience to the Holy
&gt;Scriptures and according to the intent of our
&gt;Founding Fathers."
