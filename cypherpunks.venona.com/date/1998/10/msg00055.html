On 10/1/98 2:50 PM, Robert Hettinga (rah@shipwright.com)  passed this 
wisdom:

&gt;I guess I know too many stone geniuses who've had computers since they were
&gt;children -- most of the people on this list were raised that way, I would
&gt;bet -- to take this crap too seriously, reduced attention "spans" or not.
&gt;
&gt;By the way, "span" is the wrong word for ADD. I was hardly raised on TV,
&gt;much less computers, (I had my face in science fiction books throughout
&gt;most of my childhood), and I've been known to focus on something
&gt;"inappropriately" for hours.

 Ever since I discovered my ADHD some two or three years after I started 
working with ADHD kids in the our school district a lot of things began 
to make sense.  But I came to realize and now make it a point to tell 
these kids that taken as a whole ADD/ADHD is a blessing more so than a 
curse. The ability to hyper-focus on a task at hand gives you the power 
to do in a few hours sometimes things it would take others a day or more 
to do. For the truly ADD kid (as opposed to the culturally induced 
variety) the hell he has gone through and the incredible low self-esteen 
they generally have, just hearing that is often enough to make a radical 
turn-around for them.

&gt;While I certainly have varying degrees of control of my attention, but I
&gt;just don't see that a "handicap" anymore. My attention is event-driven,
&gt;rather than processed in neat organized batches, and I've learned to like
&gt;it that way, even if it did give me trouble when I was chained in the
&gt;aforementioned tower's dungeon for most of my formative years.
&gt;
&gt;Besides, even if computers cause people to have event-driven attention
&gt;rather than in nice neat industrial batches, that's probably a Good
&gt;Thing(tm). Consider it evolution in action.
&gt;
&gt;Farmers and mechanics may need "control" of their attention, but in an
&gt;information "hunter" like myself, most of the people who do anything useful
&gt;on the net, it's a selective disadvantage.

   ... amen!!!
