&gt; 
&gt; The rules of the game from what I can see is that if one is outspoken,
&gt; one either needs to be squeaky clean, or have enough funds to hire
&gt; good lawyers, or to be anonymous.

[Notwithstanding my preference for the latter]...

Is it the cypherpunk response to back off with our tail between our legs?
I hope not.

I smiled when I read about Toto's plans to appear in court in a perl-RSA
T-shirt. Toto has balls so big he needs a wheel barrow to get around.

&gt; That is to say, I suspect that Jim would not have been locked up if he
&gt; had not a) used false social security numbers, b) not been involved
&gt; with fake courts, c) not collected IRS employees home addresses, and
&gt; d) not planted the stink bomb.

And, more importantly, if crypto-anachy and removal of governments weren't
on the cypherpunk agenda. Lets not pretend that Jim and Toto (and to a lesser
degree the scrutinee J Choate) are not scapegoats for all of our opinions.

&gt; The AP rants are perfectly defensible free speech and free-wheeling
&gt; political discussion.

Yes. "defensible", but they weren't defended. Jim pleaded. As would anyone
in the face of sufficient pressure.

&gt; Similarly with Toto, the rants would have been ok, without a) the
&gt; mockup non-functional "bomb" symbolically planted in the court house
&gt; basement or where-ever it was, b) using real IRS employees, and judges
&gt; names in his rant (apparently in support of Jim Bell), c) having
&gt; tourettes syndrome.

The rants are ok anyway. They are clearly metaphors. But the prosecutors
aren't playing fair. The man is "dangerous". And not because he wrote "bomb"
in crayon on a cardboard box. But because he made waves. Waves that we caught.
Waves that the straights and sheeple might catch.

&gt; His rants,
&gt; when he was coherent, were well written, and humorously sarcastic
&gt; observations about the increasingly facist state.
&gt; 
&gt; Just an observation.

Just.

&gt; Having blemishes, or being vulnerable in some way makes one an easy
&gt; target for governments.  Tourettes syndrome clearly isn't helping
&gt; Toto's case -- they can basically lock him up as "crazy and dangerous"
&gt; or whatever for as long as they like with no pretense of trial or
&gt; anything if it came to it.

I thought this might be because of his excessive use of metaphor rather
than a persecution of a medical condition unrelated to mental competence.

&gt; Clearly I think one should be able to say wtf one wants to, and in
&gt; general I endeavor to do just that.  But I am suggesting that
&gt; cypherpunks individually stear clear of grey areas, such as ...
&gt; Tim May style "I've got X number of now illegal armament Y",

I took the frequency of little Timmy May's 2nd ammendment rifs as a sign
that he was clean on that score. (Tim always seems to be a couple of steps
ahead).

&gt; My comment is that cypherpunks might be trying to hasten the demise of
&gt; the nation state by deployment of tools of identity and financial
&gt; privacy so that the individual can free himself from the burdens of
&gt; the state, but cypherpunks themselves (at least the non-anonymous
&gt; ones) should be squeaky clean.
&gt;
&gt; Write code, let someone else do the tax protesting, gun law
&gt; protesting, and let someone else have the personalised arguments with
&gt; over-zealous government employees.
&gt; 
&gt; Financial privacy and anonymity code, is the most caustic
&gt; anti-government expression one can utter.
&gt; 
&gt; Adam

You seem a bit down at the end there.

Illegal crypto export. That's more like it!
