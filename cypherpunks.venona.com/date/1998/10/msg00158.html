Forwarded message:

&gt; Date: Fri, 02 Oct 1998 21:42:38 +0200
&gt; From: "Albert P. Franco, II" &lt;apf2@apf2.com&gt;
&gt; Subject: IP: Clear and present danger: FIGHT AGAINST NATIONAL ID CARD
&gt;   (fwd)

&gt; I think the original message speaks of executive, legislative, and judicial
&gt; branches. As defined by the constitution this is, in fact, the federal
&gt; government.

&gt; As a matter of practice, most if not all, of the states are
&gt; also divided this way. Article X which you quoted supports the tacit
&gt; understanding that We, the people, are not actually THE government.

Really? Please expound...

We, the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common 
defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the 
United States of America. 

				ARTICLE IX. 
 
	The enumeration of the Constitution, of certain rights, shall 
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 
 
  
				ARTICLE X. 
 
	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, 
or to the people. 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

It in fact supports NO such interpretation unless you take it out of context
and alone. Much like trying to determine the ecology of a valley by
examinging a single fish...

In fact what it does say is that the Constitution was implimented by the
people and not by a government *granting* rights and privileges. It futher
states that it does not limit the rights or privileges of the people (note
it doesn't mention federal or state govts.) futher backing up that we the
people are implimenting this and not the other way around. Finaly it
specificaly states that the order of resolution for any issue is to see if
it's specificaly given to the federal govt., if not (and it's not
prohibited), then to the states (to resolve via their own representative
systems), and finaly if not covered by those two documents (the US
Constitution and the individual state constitution) then it is retained by
the people.

So we find that in fact we the people *are* the initial and final authority.

The bottem line is that *the government of the United States* consists of
three parties, the federal system, the state, and the people. That is the
government of this country and not some figmented heirarchy that has zero
basis for support.

The reason the federal is broken into 3 seperate sections is so that  there
is a measure of conflict and confrontation involved. *THE* basis for a
working democracy is the limited use of cooperation.
