 NFIB: Petition to Kill IRS Code Hits Million Signature Mark
 To: National Desk
 Contact: Jim Weidman of the National Federation of Independent
          Business, 202-554-9000

   SAN DIEGO, Calif., Oct. 28 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The National
Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) today reached a milestone
in its drive to abolish the federal tax code and replace it
with a simpler and fairer system.

   At a downtown rally here today, NFIB President Jack Faris
announced that the national petition drive calling on Congress to
sunset the current IRS code had collected its one-millionth
signature.  Onlookers cheered as Faris placed the landmark signature
atop an 18-wheeler stacked with scores of boxes bearing signed
petitions collected during the group's year-long campaign.  Labeling
the petition drive "the most ambitious tax reform initiative since
the Boston Tea Party," Faris expressed thanks to the more than 30,000
small-business owners who served as "volunteer captains, collecting
signatures on Main Streets throughout the country in this
unprecedented grassroots effort to restore reason to our tax system."

   The nation's leading small-business advocacy group, NFIB
has 600,000 members nationwide.  "We now have 1 million reasons
for Congress and the president to do what's right for small
business, and what's right for America," Faris said to a crowd
of hundreds who gathered in front of an IRS office building
for the tax reform event.  "These first 1 million petitions
will serve as the symbol as well as the fuel that keeps this
effort to abolish the code going strong.  We won't give up!"
Faris also added that "NFIB will continue to gather petitions
and grassroots support, because Washington sees the light when
they feel the heat from Main Street."

   Faris outlined his group's plan for action in the 106th Congress:
"NFIB will continue to stand up for small business on this issue and
others.  We will be a catalyst, urging Congress to sunset the IRS
code as the first step toward responsible tax reform, so that the new
century may begin under transition to a new tax system." Noting that
the nation's economy is strong, and economic optimism is high, Faris
said, "This is the right time for Congress and the president to
answer the call from grassroots America and replace our broken tax
code.  To ignore that call -- at a time when we are able to answer
it -- would be irresponsible.  One million signatures can't
be ignored."

   The San Diego rally was the latest event in NFIB's ongoing
"Campaign for Responsible Tax Reform," which was kicked off
one year ago in Independence, Mo.  Today's event was simulcast
live on the Roger Hedgecock Show on KSDO-AM (1130) and KOGO-AM
(600).
