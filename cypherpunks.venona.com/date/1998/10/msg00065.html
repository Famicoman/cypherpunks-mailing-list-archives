&gt; Local Sovereignty Update
&gt; US Court Again Upholds State Sovereignty and Strikes Down Federal =
&gt; Mandate
&gt; This month we have another case in which the federal courts have =
&gt; recognized that the federal government has no authority to impose any =
&gt; mandate on state or local government.
&gt; Printz v. US ruled that  '[t]he Federal Government may neither issue =
&gt; directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor =
&gt; command the States' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, =
&gt; to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.'   That across =
&gt; the board prohibition is simply being applied to various federal =
&gt; mandates one after the other.=20
&gt; =20
&gt; CONDON v US,  Decided: September 3, 1998 =20
&gt; 
&gt; =20
&gt; In 1994 Congress passed the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), =
&gt; which tried to set federal standards governing how and when information =
&gt; in driving records could be released.   The DPPA said that  "Any State =
&gt; department of motor vehicles that has a policy or practice of =
&gt; substantial noncom- pliance . . . shall be subject to a civil penalty =
&gt; imposed by the Attorney General of not more than $5,000 a day."=20
&gt; =20
&gt; South Carolina, joined by several other states, refused to implement the =
&gt; Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), and sued the Federal government =
&gt; in US Court demanding that the law be recognized by the federal courts =
&gt; as a violation of the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the United States =
&gt; Constitution.
&gt; =20
&gt; The Fourth Circuit Court struck down DPPA ruling that
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "Under our system of dual sovereignty, "[t]he powers not delegated to =
&gt; the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the =
&gt; States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." U.S. =
&gt; Const. amend. X. Because Congress lacked the authority to enact the DPPA =
&gt; under either the Commerce Clause or Section 5 of the Fourteenth =
&gt; Amendment, we affirm the judgment of the district court."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Court also stated plainly that: "Congress may not enact any law that =
&gt; would direct the functioning of the States' executives or legislatures." =
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Citing the New York and Printz cases the court said that the Supreme =
&gt; Court's ruling with respect to federal mandates "has been a model of =
&gt; consistency."=20
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the more important quotes from the case follow:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992)  the Supreme Court =
&gt; held that Congress could not "commandeer[ ] the legislative processes of =
&gt; the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal =
&gt; regulatory program."  ... In Printz v. US the court held "that Congress =
&gt; cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the State's officers =
&gt; directly." Id. at 2384. The Court went on to note that  '[t]he Federal =
&gt; Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address =
&gt; particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of their =
&gt; political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory =
&gt; program.' "
&gt; =20
&gt; 
&gt; "The Supreme Court, in both New York and Printz, has made it perfectly =
&gt; clear that the Federal Government may not require State officials to =
&gt; administer a federal regulatory program."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "Although Congress has regulated the disclosure of personal information =
&gt; by some private parties, the Constitution permits Congress to regulate =
&gt; the conduct of individuals. In contrast, Congress may not, as a general =
&gt; matter, regulate the conduct of the States. See New York, 505 U.S. at =
&gt; 166 ("[T]he Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon =
&gt; Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States." (quoted with =
&gt; approval in Printz, 117 S. Ct. at 2377)). "
&gt; 
&gt; "The United States also contends that the DPPA was properly enacted =
&gt; pursuant to Congress's power under Section 5 of the Four- teenth =
&gt; Amendment. In light of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in City of =
&gt; Boerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997), we are constrained to =
&gt; disagree."
&gt; 
&gt; Congress's power to enact legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment is =
&gt; not unlimited, however. See, e.g. , City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. =
&gt; 2157, 2171 (1997) (holding that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is =
&gt; "a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional =
&gt; prerogatives," and that Congress exceeded its power under the Fourteenth =
&gt; Amendment in enacting the statute); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, =
&gt; 469 (1991) (stating that "the Four- teenth Amendment does not override =
&gt; all principles of federalism"); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 128 =
&gt; (1970) (noting that "[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power =
&gt; is, it is not unlimited"). For instance, Congress's power "extends only =
&gt; to enforc[ing] the provi- sions of the Fourteenth Amendment." City of =
&gt; Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2164 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks =
&gt; omitted). Of perhaps equal importance, it is only a preventative or =
&gt; remedial power, not a substantive power. See id. at 2167. As a result, =
&gt; Congress does not possess "the power to determine what constitutes a =
&gt; constitutional violation." Id. at 2164.=20
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever found a =
&gt; constitutional right to privacy with respect to the type of information =
&gt; found in motor vehicle records.   Accordingly, Congress did not have the =
&gt; authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact the =
&gt; DPPA."
