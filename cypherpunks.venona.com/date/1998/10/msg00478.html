This sounds like it could be a dis.org project. Maybe Phon-e and HummerMan
are conspiring to rid us of Carolyn in a spectacular way next August.

Anyone know the range^h^h^h^h^h distance from Berkeley to New Mexico?

&gt; Intelligence, N. 86, 5 October 1998, p. 12
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; USA
&gt;
&gt; THE SCUD THAT DIDN'T GET AWAY
&gt;
&gt; At "Intelligence", we're taking bets that you won't hear about
&gt; the unidentified British firm which used an unnamed British
&gt; freighter to import a fully-operational SS-1C Scud missile --
&gt; complete with launcher, but missing its warhead -- into the
&gt; United States.  According to a 25 September report in the
&gt; "Washington Times", special investigators from HM Customs and
&gt; Excise have been asked to determine how paperwork sent with the
&gt; system came to be falsified, but they're probably going to run
&gt; into ... the Pentagon because the Scud missile and its mobile
&gt; transporter-erector launcher were seized on 2 September by the
&gt; US Customs Service at Port Hueneme, California, about 56 km.
&gt; north of Los Angeles and ... next door to the US Navy Point
&gt; Mugu Pacific Missile Range, and ... the closest military port
&gt; to the Vandenburg US Air Force Base where all classified US
&gt; military launches take place.
&gt;
&gt; The Russian-designed, Czech-manufactured missile system was
&gt; licensed for importation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
&gt; Firearms (ATF), but ... it was wrongly described.  Although
&gt; addressed to a wealthy -- but so far unnamed (and bets are he
&gt; will never be named) -- US citizen, who is regarded as a bona
&gt; fide weapons collector rather than an arms dealer, the missile
&gt; system had not been made inoperable as required by import
&gt; rules.  This is, of course, of interest to the Pentagon.  "This
&gt; is a full-blown missile," stated John Hensley, a senior agent
&gt; of US Customs Service in Los Angeles.  "The only thing missing
&gt; is the warhead."  The launch chassis is a MAZ-543 truck,
&gt; commonly used by former Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces.  "The
&gt; guidance system was totally intact and the engine was ready to
&gt; go," Mr. Hensley said.  "All you needed to do was strap on a
&gt; garbage can full of C-4 high-explosive and you had a weapon."
&gt; The guidance system and engine would, of course, be of intense
&gt; interest to Pentagon intelligence, and the Israeli Mossad,
&gt; particularly if the weapon is a later date or recent model.
&gt;
&gt; Hensley said the buyer, who lives in Palo Alto, had previously
&gt; purchased a Scud missile that had been properly demilitarized.
&gt; Under US law, such weapons may be imported, provided they are
&gt; first cut up with a blowtorch so that they can never be
&gt; reassembled.  But in this case, in an effort to fool customs
&gt; officials, a photograph of the first -- cut up -- missile to be
&gt; imported was attached to the illegal -- intact -- system, which
&gt; was seized on 2 September.  If the "buyer" really wanted his
&gt; missile, then the San Francisco Bay, which Palo Alto overlooks,
&gt; is a much better port of entry.  Bets at "Intelligence" are
&gt; also out on the "buyer" being associated with the military-
&gt; funded Stanford Research Institute (SRI) or similar Pentagon-
&gt; dependent firms in nearby Silicon Valley.
&gt;
&gt; COMMENT  --  The SS-1C Scud is a liquid-fueled missile which is
&gt; among the most widely deployed weapons in the world.  It is in
&gt; service in 16 nations.  Iraq's military forces were able to
&gt; extend the range of the missile ("with baling wire and
&gt; plywood", according to certain specialists), and used it
&gt; extensively during the 1991 Gulf war.  International transfers
&gt; of such missiles, which normally have a range of 300 km., are
&gt; banned under the Missile Technology Control Regime.  Although
&gt; the major media suggested the seizure would embarrass the
&gt; Clinton administration, currently engaged in a major
&gt; international diplomatic effort to halt exports of weapons of
&gt; mass destruction and missile-delivery systems by Russia and
&gt; China to the Middle East, it would seem more likely that the
&gt; affair will "drag out indefinitely" in a California court,
&gt; unless an appropriate "buyer" can be "sacrificed" publicly.
