 Group 'No Privacy for Privacy Hypocrites' Surveys Congress

   WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 /U.S. Newswire/ -- No Privacy for Privacy
Hypocrites, a citizen's group formed to counteract the assault
on privacy by the Kenneth Starr/congressional investigations
into President Clinton's sex life, has distributed a survey
to Members of Congress regarding their views on privacy.

   Members of Congress who oppose privacy rights will be asked
whether or not they have ever participated in an adulterous
affair, and whether or not they have lied about it.

   The group is concerned that the Kenneth Starr/congressional
investigations into the president's sex life are having a negative
impact on privacy that will affect ordinary citizens.

   "This whole sad affair is the product of decades-long disrespect
for privacy, for which our political leaders are responsible," said
Evan Hendricks, Editor and Publisher of "Privacy Times," and one of
the organizers of the group.

   "This effort is intended to arrest the free fall of privacy rights
triggered by the stunning abuses of power by the Starr investigation
and the Congressional dissemination of personal information," said
James Love.

   Today, No Privacy for Privacy Hypocrites distributed a survey to
Members of Congress asking:

  1. (A) Is consensual, non-commercial sexual conduct by adults in
private ever a proper subject for government inquiry? (B) Do you
believe that any branch of government should investigate allegations
that elected officials may have participated in an adulterous affair,
including allegations that they may have lied about it?

  2. If you answered "yes" to (A) or (B) in question (1): (A) Have
you ever participated in an adulterous affair?  (B) If yes, have you
ever lied about it?

  3. Do you think that any public official who has committed adultery
and lied about it should resign from public office?

   Survey responses will be placed on the web at:
<A  HREF="http://www.noprivacy.org">http://www.noprivacy.org</A>, as soon the surveys are returned.
