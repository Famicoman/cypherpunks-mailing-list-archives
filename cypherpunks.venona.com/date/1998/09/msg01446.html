DEL-ID... AN UNUSUAL AND INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ID AUTHENTICATION 

    MONTREAL, Sept. 28 /CNW-PRN/ - The market for ID authentication
products that use biometric technologies is experiencing strong growth. The
dominant technology at the moment uses finger prints (or, to be exact,
finger print details, such as bifurcations or ridge endings). The reason is
simple.  It has long been accepted that finger prints are unique to each
individual; this assumption is backed by probability analyses confirming
that the theoretical probability of finding similar finger-print detail
configurations in two different individuals is about 10(-20) (that is,
about one chance in a billion billion).  In practice, however, measuring
errors can occur when processing finger-print images, increasing the
probability of error to about one in a
thousand for top-quality commercial systems.

    There are weaknesses in the existing approach, however. For example,
privacy cannot be guaranteed when a digital finger print is used for ID
authentication and large pieces of equipment are required.  For these
reasons, other options must be considered. The del-ID solution proposed by
delSecur is an original and attractive approach. 

    The delSecur system processes finger-print image data analogically, not
digitally, creating an abstract image of the characteristics of the human
finger.  The video signal from the reader that captures the finger image is
analogically processed.  To register with the del-ID authentication system,
you place your finger over the reader (without touching it, so you don't
leave finger prints on it) and an abstract image of your finger print is
stored. This becomes your personal electronic signature.  When someone
claiming to be you places his finger over the reader, a new abstract image
is generated and authenticated by comparison with the stored image; a
comparison matrix developed by delSecur is used to determine the similarity
of the two images. The matrix, patented by delSecur, comes from the field
of photography and may be combined with other metric matrices developed by
CRIM or borrowed from other existing technologies.

    The delSecur concept is original. It is different from conventional
approaches and its architecture is unusually simple.  What distinguishes
the delSecur concept is the representation of the finger image and the
technology that allows this representation to be used for authentication.
delSecur uses a patented process to create an abstract image that contains
data unique to an individual. delSecur not only built a device to
demonstrate the potential of the concept but also developed a preliminary
architecture for the registration and authentication prototype, making it
possible to analyze the concept--the maximum rotation angle for feasibility
and authentication, for example. 

    Given the encouraging results of the scientific evaluation of the basic
concept of the del-ID system, delSecur, in partnership with CRIM and other
firms, is planning to begin a case study and pilot projects with large
Canadian and international firms to clarify and test technical details.
The ultimate goal is implementation of a wide variety of applications on a
very large scale.

    The del-ID system is marketed by delSecur, a Canadian company wholly
owned by Grandeur Inc., a firm listed on the New York stock exchange.
