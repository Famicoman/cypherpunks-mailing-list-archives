ID proposal raises privacy concerns
 2.15 p.m. ET (1816 GMT) September 17, 1998

 WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers raised loss-of-privacy objections Thursday to
a proposal that would use Social Security numbers to help curb the number
of illegal immigrants who unlawfully get government benefits. 

 The proposal by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would
require federal agencies to accept, as proof of identity, a driver's
license that conforms to certain standards. A Social Security number would
be among the requirements. 

 Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., said the measure "appears to create a de
facto national ID card'' for all Americans. 

 "With a Social Security number, anyone can find out almost anything about
an individual on the Internet, including where he or she lives,'' said
McIntosh, who chairs the House Government Reform and Oversight's
subcommittee on national economic growth. "This technology gives stalkers
and abusers easy access to their victims.'' 

 During a committee hearing on the proposal, Celene Cross described how
someone fraudulently used her name and Social Security number to obtain
credit cards and rack up more than $17,000 in charges. Cross said she has
spent three years trying to clear her credit history but problems continue
to arise, and "I have just quit applying for credit altogether.'' 

 Marvin Young, another panel witness, told lawmakers how a former roommate
used his Social Security number to assume his identity and open more than
40 charge cards. 

 "I've worked hard and never made a late payment in my life, but this other
guy has just messed up everything for me,'' Young said. 

 In a statement submitted to the committee, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration said its proposal is intended to "prevent the use of
state driver's licenses and other identification documents by illegal
immigrants seeking to obtain benefits under federal programs.''
