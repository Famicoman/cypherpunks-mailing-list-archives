&gt;Happy Fourth of July! and how did this thread start?

&gt;&gt;         I'd also suggest using a water extinguisher, the kind you can
&gt;&gt; refill/recharge yourself. There are some out there, the big silver kind
&gt;&gt; where you can unscrew the top and fill with your liquid of choice, then
&gt;&gt; presurize with  a tire pump. As an aside, one _could_ fill these with a
&gt;&gt; combination of gasoline and a gelling agent to make a short range flame
&gt;&gt; thrower, not that that would be a smart or safe thing to do (really, there
&gt;&gt; wouldn't be much to keep the flame from wandering back up inside the
&gt;&gt; cylinder, and haveing it explode in your hands would make it very hard to
&gt;&gt; type...).
&gt;Actually these things are usually inverted so that the liquid is fed out
&gt;from the bottom so the hose probably won't act like a fuse. At least

	Some are, some aren't. depends on the age.

&gt;until the liquid runs out and there is a combustible pathway into the
&gt;container. If you try this one could you get someone to videotape it
&gt;from a safe distance? It would make a great AVI for an 'anarchists on
&gt;the web' site.

	Ummm, I live in the middle of Chicago, I don't think it's going to
be anytime soon.

&gt;At least mention nitrogen or helium.

	Yeah, but it's harder to get than Air, which can be done with a
bicycle pump.

&gt;But COMPRESSED_AIR + GASOLINE?
&gt;Are you one nut short of a matched pair?
&gt;Gasoline scares the hell out of me. It should you.

	Did you see the part where I mention that I am (a) an ex-marine,
and that (b) whilst in the Marine Corpse I was in Aircraft Firefighting and
Rescue? You ever seen 3000 gallons of jet fuel burn, and it was your job to
get up close and personal with a fire hose.

	5 gals. of burning gasoline is NOT a problem. 5 Gals. cooking off
in a sealed container IS a problem.

&gt;You don't live anywhere near me do you?

	You live in S.F. right?

&gt;You should try baking bread instead.

	Boring.

&gt;Don't you think this conversation should be continued on some AOL forum?

	Fuck you.

petro@playboy.com----for work related issues. I don't speak for Playboy.
petro@bounty.org-----for everthing else.      They wouldn't like that.
                                              They REALLY
Economic speech IS political speech.          wouldn't like that.
