Better yet, give anyone on the mailing list a veto over their new
membership. Send a cookie to the address that was signed up, and an
anti-cookie. If anyone returns the anti-cookie, in effect saying "we don't
want to be part of your blasted service," put them on a list of
do-not-contact people for half a year or so.

That will minimise disruptions. It will also minimise disruptions to your
service when pissed-off vigilantes decide to take matters into their own
hands.

&gt; &gt;Really.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; As others have noted, operations like "sixdegrees" need to be very careful
&gt; about how list addresses are signed up. This is a problem mailing lists
&gt; (formerly called "list exploders," until Congress began to rant about
&gt; Internet terrorists) have been dealing with for many years.
&gt; 
&gt; "Lists subscribed to lists," with resulting circularity problems, is
&gt; something that can bring a list to standstill.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the dozens of irate messages about "sixdegrees," and the joking
&gt; responses sent to "I hear you are my friend, but who are you?" queries seen
&gt; from hapless "sixdegrees" clients, the meltdown may be underway.
&gt; 
&gt; There are concrete things you folks can do. When someone is nominated (or
&gt; whatever) as a potential contact, you can ask the contactee if he or she
&gt; wants this person to be a contact. In other words, take some of the
&gt; automation out of the loop.
&gt; 
&gt; (Or add more of the right kind, such as sending a cookie or chit back to
&gt; the parties and require them to forward the cookies back. This, of course,
&gt; adds complexity for the "sixdegrees" customers and may actually cause many
&gt; of them to just give up in frustration.)
&gt; 
&gt; If you do nothing, expect many of us to get more and more irate at the
&gt; abuses your service are facillitating. I expect some of the list
&gt; subscribers on lists your service "infects" will take the usual hackers
&gt; measures to crash your system.
&gt; 
&gt; Not that I necessarily endorse this, but it's happened in the past.
