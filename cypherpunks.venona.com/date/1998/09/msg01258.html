Net Privacy Code Drafted

OTTAWA (CP) -- Internet providers have released their own draft privacy
code just as the government prepares to introduce legislation this fall on
the matter.

The Canadian Association of Internet Providers, which represents more than
120 providers, hopes industry efforts to regulate itself will stave off
government action it says could lead to onerous and potentially harmful
national regulations enshrined in law.

"If it's extremely onerous for an international company to do business in
Canada, they will not do business in Canada," Julie Garcia, senior counsel
at America Online Inc. who helped develop the draft code, said.

The code, intended to be voluntary, addresses concerns such as control and
disclosure of users' personal information.

It was drafted to ensure it complies with the Canadian Standards
Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information.

The Internet providers code sets out 10 privacy principles for the
industry, including:

*      Internet providers are responsible for personal information
under their control.

*      Providers must disclose reasons for collecting personal
information.

*      Consent of users is mandatory for collection, use or disclosure
of information.

*      Personal information can be disclosed without consent only as
required by law.

"The majority of CAIP members already have some kind of a privacy
policy," said Margo Langford, chairwoman of the Internet association.

"What we're really trying for here is uniformity. I don't think you'll
find anybody that objects to the notion. Privacy is good for business."

The Internet providers association says U.S. experience has shown that
voluntary regulation works better than government law because it fosters
competition among providers to meet user demands.

Surveys have shown consumers are wary about using the Internet because
of concerns about the privacy of their personal information.

The federal government wants to introduce legislation early this fall to
protect Internet privacy, especially for electronic commerce purposes,
before
Canada is host of an Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development conference in October.

Ottawa established a group to study electronic commerce and it produced a
paper on privacy that recommends legislation to address the very issues
the Internet association's draft code covers.

In addition, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission announced in July it would hold public hearings in November
on whether it should get involved in regulating new media, including the
Internet.
