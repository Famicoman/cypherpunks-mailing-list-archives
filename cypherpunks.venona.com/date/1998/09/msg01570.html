Do you know anyone that needs to lose weight?

Of course you do! There are over 92 million overweight people in the US alone. The weight-loss 
industry brings in billions of dollars each year.  A recent Harris poll indicated that 74% of Americans 
are overweight or would like to lose a few pounds.

THE ALL NATURAL WEIGHT LOSS PATCH

Just introduced in May, 1998, the All Natural TrimPatch is the most significant development in the 
industry.  The patch suppresses appetite, naturally.  100% homeopathic ingredients, with time 
released nutrients that enter the bloodstream through the skin.  Just peel and stick.  Four years in 
development.  87% of people lost weight in clinical studies.  60 Medical Doctors and Pharmacists on 
advisory board.  No shakes or drinks, no pills, no special menus.

THE PRODUCT:

The transdermal weight loss patch, call "All Natural TrimPatch" is a simple, safe and sensible way to 
lose and control weight.  It is completely homeopathic, with time-released nutrients that enter the 
bloodstream through the skin.  Transdermal is the third most effective way to introduce a substance 
to the body, after intravenous and sub-lingual.  TrimPatch works by suppressing an person's 
appetite and increasing fat metabolism.  It has NO stimulants.  Simply Peel, Stick, and Forget!

TESTING:

The product was tested over 2 years on 2,400 people with an 87% success rate.  It was overseen 
by 60 MD's in consultation with many Homeopaths.  There were no side effects in the entire study, 
other than a slight minor rash from the adhesive on some people, which left in 24 hours.  Double 
blind placebo test methods were used.  Over 900 MD's were on the Manufacturer's Advisory Board.  
There are 60 Medical Doctors and pharmacists who have been active in the clinical studies of the 
patch.

PRODUCT EFFECTIVENESS:

The average weight loss was 3 lbs. after 2 weeks, 8 lbs. after 4 weeks, and 13 lbs. after 6 weeks.

GURARANTEED RESULTS BY THE COMPANY:

All Patches come with a 30 day, 100% money back guarantee. 

MARKET:

Weight loss is a $33 billion dollar a year industry. Think about it. How many people do you know 
personally who'd like to be trim? With the recent withdrawal of Redux &amp; Phen-Fen from the 
market, people want a SAFE product to help them balance their weight.  More than a third of the 
American population is overweight. 53 million people are considered "obese." A Harris Poll 
(February, 1996) reveals that "74% OF AMERICANS ARE OVERWEIGHT." Our society wants 
something that is easy for them to do. 

Transdermal application industry is rapidly growing. Nicoderm, Vitamin C, Nitro-Glycerin, Estrogen, 
Testosterone, Cortisone, Pain, Morphine, Motion Patches, and Local Anesthetic Patches are 
currently being used.
