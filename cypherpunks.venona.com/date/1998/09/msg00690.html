&gt; Well, I've been working for a couple of days and spent the weekend before
&gt; that with The Report. I read all of it, including the footnotes, every
&gt; damn one of them, and they're where all the good stuff is, btw.  Given
&gt; that weekend study, it's apparent to me, after reviewing several days
&gt; of posts on this topic on this list, that most of you people can't
&gt; or don't read or have the attention spans of gnats.  
&gt; 
&gt; The perjury case has some serious reasonable doubt problems, the
&gt; abuse of power case is thin, thin, and the executive privilege 
&gt; stuff is there as sheer trade goods to give Congress something
&gt; to throw out.  In legal parlance, it wouldn't pass Rule 11.
&gt; And I don't know who is giving you legal advice, but there's
&gt; no sexual harrassment count in the thing.  Read it, if you can.
&gt; Peferably after your medication.

Mac,
Rather than merely writing to say what bozos all the list members
are (unfairly stereotyping us all - even those not from AOL :-),
why don't you give us the benefit of a little of your expertise?
Why do you believe the perjury case has `reasonable doubt' problems?
{Were I on a jury and if convinced that matters are as Starr
presents them, I would have no problem deciding that Clinton lied
in the deposition at least, where the term `sexual relations' seems
to have been carefully and explicitly defined - even assuming that
he /shouldn't/ be convicted on what seems a clear intent to deceive
the court and later the grand jury on multiple points.}

And the abuse of power case seems thin even to a non-lawyer.  But
where does the `executive privilege stuff' come in?  I don't see
that Starr listed that among his possible grounds for impeachment.

And what about obstruction of justice?  Do you see any merit to those
charges?

Inquiring minds want to know.
