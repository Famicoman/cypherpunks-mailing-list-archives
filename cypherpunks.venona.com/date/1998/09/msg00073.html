&gt; Here in Austin we have a local radio dj who does a public

&gt; Anyone have a clue what he's talking about?

Had a bioweapons test occurred in the people's republic of 
San Francisco, it seems likely they would have erected 
billboards spelling out the details in letters visible from 
the moon.

I assume that this is one of these anonymous source things.  
According to official, yet anonymous sources the US/CIA 
forces committed every crime of every regime around the 
world, including the purported crimes of Pol Pot in Cambodia, 
(I kid you not) and they are actually running a totalitarian 
state in the USA but the people are too brainwashed to 
notice.  They also sell cocaine.

Similarly, according to sources that are not anonymous, but 
which (strange to report) no one else can find, Nike is 
actually producing its shoes in something very like slave 
labor camps.

The reason the refutation of the CNN story (US uses nerve gas 
to kill defectors and exterminate villagers) made such news 
is that CNN was so careless as to actually name identifiable 
real people as the source of this story. (They needed faces 
and it is hard to put the faces of anonymous sources on TV.) 
Naturally those real people were mighty pissed and denied the 
story attributed to them.

There is a wagon load of similar stories using supposedly 
official, but anonymous sources, or sources that do not 
appear to be real people.  The print media works much better 
for such sources than TV.

In short, do you think the internet is the net of a million 
lies?  Not so.  It is the place where lies get exposed. It is
far easier to get away with lying in the old media, because
nobody answers you back.
