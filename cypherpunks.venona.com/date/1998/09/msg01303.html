U.S. SAYS BOMB SUSPECT HAD NUCLEAR AMBITIONS

 From Tribune News Services
 September 27, 1998

 AFRICA -- American authorities have
 charged that a person described as a senior
 deputy to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
 suspected in last month's bombings of two
 U.S. Embassies in East Africa, made
 significant efforts on behalf of the bin Laden
 group in 1993 to develop nuclear weapons.

 The authorities said that, in at least one
 case, there was evidence of documents
 relating to a proposed purchase of enriched
 uranium, but they did not say whether the
 group obtained uranium.

 The allegations, concerning Mamdouh
 Mahmud Salim, also assert that bin Laden
 had an official agreement with the Iranian
 government and with Sudan's ruling party to
 oppose the United States.

 They also suggest that the U.S. had
 penetrated the bin Laden organization and
 learned detailed information in 1996.

 The allegations were contained in newly
 unsealed court papers that charged Salim
 with conspiracy to murder and to use
 weapons of mass destruction against
 Americans overseas, including those in
 Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.

 Salim was arrested in Germany a week ago
 after flying there from Sudan. The U.S. said
 Friday it will seek his extradition to face
 charges in New York City.

 The government also asserted for the first
 time in court papers that the Iranian
 government had entered into a formal
 three-way "working agreement" with bin
 Laden and the National Islamic Front of the
 Sudan to "work together against the United
 States, Israel and the West." The front is the
 ruling party in Sudan.

 The Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
 Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed
 more than 250 people.
