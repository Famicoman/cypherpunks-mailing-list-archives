National ID Cards

Many countries are actively considering adopting national id cards for a
variety of functions. These
include the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Over the past seven
years, Privacy International
has been at the forefront of opposing these proposals in a number of
countries including Australia, New
Zealand, the Phillippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.

These pages are an attempt to bring together materials based on PI members'
experiences on opposing
the proposals. While each jurisdictions may have local variations, the
themes remain remarkably similar
no matter where the proposals are heard. Our intention here is to discuss
the evidence at an international
level and to promote debate about the claims made about such card systems.
