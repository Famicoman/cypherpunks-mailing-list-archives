&gt; 
&gt; Lightly? You jest.

No I don't. I can start a business for as little as $15 to register a DBA
and I don't need licenses or other sorts of regulatory permissions. If I
sell a product or service (some are exempt, check your local area) I'll need
a tax number to pay my state sales tax (though they do nothing to regulate
my business other than specify that I must pay x% of my sales to the
community). Getting that tax number is free. Outside of that (at least in
Texas) I'm ready to go.

Yep, that's a lot of regulation, no forms or permission slips from some
in loco parentis, no reports or annual fees.

&gt; No, we certainly don't live in a free market, we have
&gt; a mixed economy. We *should* have a free market,

No we shouldn't. The fact that monopolies can exist in this lightly
regulated economy is ample evidence that the non-regulated or free-market
theory is nothing more than another pie-in-the-sky utopian dream.
Unrealistic and unrealizable.

If you seriously think this is a heavily regulated market you should do more
research into such places as Nazi Germany, Russia, China, etc.

&gt; are much more destructive and pervasive than any potential abuses by
&gt; market leaders.

Monopolies are monopolies, claiming that they will be less abusive in a
regulated market than in a free-market just demonstrates a lack of
understanding of basic human instincts.

You are claiming that if we do away with the food regulations that McDonalds
will be *more* concerned about their meat being cooked thoroughly then you
obviously don't understand people who chase the bottem line to the exclusion
of all else.

&gt; Also, the latter abuses are naturally corrected by
&gt; competition,

If a market monopolizes there is *NO* competition. If the market is one that
takes a large investment in intellectual or capital materials then there
won't be any opportunity to even attempt to start a competitive venture.

&gt; The answer for establishing "rules" which insure "fairness," such as

Fairness is about the consumer, not the manufacturer. This misunderstanding
(if not intentional misdirection) by free-market mavens is at least one
indication why it won't work.

&gt; competition. Make it a contractually issue and not a criminal one,

Contractual with who?

&gt; reputation for punishment instead of life and liberty, 

Businesses are neither alive nor do they enjoy liberty. Don't confuse people
with systems and objects.
