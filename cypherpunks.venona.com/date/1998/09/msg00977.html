1. 360 Millions For What ?<BR>
<BR>
background: the CFC finally spit out the revised estimate of<BR>
registration until the end year 2002:<BR>
        120 millions in set up costs<BR>
        240 millions for operation (60 M per year for 4 years). <BR>

        From: David A Tomlinson &lt;<FONT COLOR=0000ff><U>nfadat@telusplanet.net<FONT COLOR=000000 DEFAULT="COLOR"></U>&gt;<BR>
        Subject: BOY ARE THEY GONNA BOMB...<BR>
<BR>
&gt; If, however, it is an unrestricted rifle or shotgun, then it will NOT have<BR>
&gt; to be "verified" -- no matter how many times it is transferred and<BR>
&gt; re-registered -- until 01 Jan 2003.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let me see if I can get this straight now:<BR>
<BR>
- -- a) re-arrangement of the data set:<BR>
<BR>
In order to justify the National Firearms Registry (and the whole CFC<BR>
existence), the Canadian Firearms Centre came out with its own<BR>
statistics, having rejected the actual firearms crime figures from both<BR>
the RCMP and Statistics Canada.<BR>
<BR>
The CFC's point what to "prove" that the "problem" firearms were not the<BR>
legally registered restricted firearms (these were so easy to ban<BR>
outright) but the unrestricted  rifles and shotguns.<BR>
<BR>
- -- b) verification: flavor of the day<BR>
<BR>
First, the CFC came out with the dumb "fill-it-in-yourself" postcard,<BR>
guaranteed to collect essentially trash and hopelessely corrupt the<BR>
entire National Firearms Registry.<BR>
<BR>
Second, the CFC announced that after the registration deadline (Dec. 31,<BR>
2002), all the 7 million records would be examined to weed out the<BR>
trash. An impossible task.  Hercules did not pussyfoot around with a<BR>
shovel in Augias' stables. It means that the registration work would<BR>
have to be redone entirely and taking a corrupt database as the only<BR>
source of information. At the end of 2002, the National Firearms<BR>
Registry would be a collection of trash with absolutely no legal value.<BR>
<BR>
The importance of "legal value" ? Let's see ... "A Ruger Mini-14 ? No, I<BR>
surrendered that newly banned gun years ago. Your records must be wrong.<BR>
No, I did not keep the stinking receit. I don't have to prove I'm<BR>
innocent, you have to prove I'm guilty. Get lost !" What they goonna do<BR>
? Break down the door at 03:00 with machine guns ?<BR>
<BR>
Third, the CFC announced it would do verification on the fly. Stuck with<BR>
sky-rocketing costs, the best it could come up with was to recruit<BR>
6,000, then 3,000 unpaid volunteers --  a few weeks before the law is to<BR>
take effect on Oct. 1, 1998. Each of them would have to proceed with an<BR>
average number of 2,300 verifications within a 4-year time frame to<BR>
ensure the protection of 7 miilion firearm registration records against<BR>
corruption.<BR>
<BR>
Fourth, DAT's posting now clarifes that verification only applies to<BR>
restricted firearms. This coincides with the last few days left before<BR>
Oct. 1st and a seeming conclusion that the CFC failed to find in time<BR>
3,000 persons dumb enough to come mow their lawn for free.<BR>
<BR>
- -- end result :<BR>
<BR>
    - the CFC's own self-serving estimates of 7 million firearms<BR>
      (a case has been made of an actual number of 20 millions)<BR>
<BR>
    - registered restricted firearms records with the gov.: 1 million<BR>
<BR>
    ---&gt; rifles/shotguns outnumber restricted guns by 6:1<BR>
<BR>
1. 86 % of registration applications (rifles and shotguns) will be<BR>
exempt from verification. Brilliant ! A few days before the Oct. 1st<BR>
deadline, we are now back at square two: 6 million trash records, to be<BR>
verified "maniana". (Spanish for either really "tomorrow" or "in the<BR>
fullness of time", the audience must judge which applies). <BR>
<BR>
2. The remaining 14 % (handguns and other restricteds) already on file<BR>
were ALREADY verified and need to verified AGAIN (but rifles and<BR>
shotguns only need to be registered ONCE ever - right !).<BR>
<BR>
3. The principle of the day is that the firearms allegedly most often<BR>
used in domestic violence do not need no stinking verification but the<BR>
considerably smaller stock of restricted firearms already verified must<BR>
be verified.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion:<BR>
<BR>
For 360 millions, we will end up with a National Firearms Registry with<BR>
absolutely no legal value.<BR>
<BR>
In 2003, a new round of hundreds of millions will be required again to<BR>
magically clean up an entirely corrupt Registry. No deadline set. Hey<BR>
CFC, please don't say it. I do not want to be told again that the enire<BR>
after-the-fact verification program will only cost 85 millions.<BR>
<BR>
It really is not that complicated. Either the registration applications<BR>
need to be verified or they don't. A rifle/shotgun owner is just as<BR>
liable as a handgun owner to make a mistake when describing a firearm on<BR>
a registration form.<BR>
<BR>
Arguing that the type of firearm changes the requirement is essentially<BR>
negociating on the principle. (Clinton: oral sex does not count as a<BR>
sexual relationship).<BR>
<BR>
The sort of people who have not figured out yet that a principle is<BR>
somehting that is not open to negociation and compromise are the sort of<BR>
people who have no principles.<BR>
<BR>
So, in the end, the registration process will have worthless data on the<BR>
unrestricted firearms -- allegedly the ones most often used in crime and<BR>
the emphasis on accurate registration will be placed on the other,<BR>
considerably smaller lot, of firearms.<BR>
<BR>
Odd, I thought this is what the government has been doing since 1934.<BR>
And failed ever since.<BR>
<BR>
Do not pass go, do not collect $ 200, lose a turn and go back to square<BR>
0.<BR>
<BR>
    IS THIS WHAT WE GET FOR 360 MILLIONS ?<BR>
<BR>
And Allan Rock, who brought us C-68, now does not have money to<BR>
compensate hep-C victims.<BR>
<BR>
- ---------------<BR>
<BR>
2.    Question to the CFC: When are you going to disclose your revised fees<BR>
?<BR>
<BR>
Announced roughly within the same time frame as the 85 million dollar<BR>
cost for the entire 7-year gun registry (starting from 1995 until the<BR>
end of 2002).<BR>
<BR>
The following base figures are those of the CFC:<BR>
<BR>
    registration fee: $ 10 initially for "up to 10 firearms", increasing to<BR>
$ 18.<BR>
    possession permit: $ 10 initially, increasing to $ 60 near the end.<BR>
    number of gun owners: 3 millions<BR>
    number of firearms: 7 millions<BR>
    proportion of gun owners enticed into early compliance by low initial<BR>
fee: 30%<BR>
    average number of firearms per gun owner: 2.3 (less than 10)<BR>
<BR>
    First 30 %: 900,000 gun owners, 2.1 million guns:         18 M$<BR>
            0.9 million permits x $ 10/permit = 9 M$<BR>
            0.9 million registrations x $ 10  = 9 M$<BR>
<BR>
    Last 70 % : 2.1 million gun owners, 4.9 million guns:            164 M$<BR>
            2.1 million permits x $ 60/permit = 126 M$<BR>
            2.1 million registrations x $ 18  =  38 M$<BR>
<BR>
    Total tax grab by Dec. 31st, 2002                182 M $<BR>
                                    -------<BR>
<BR>
Note that the number of registration applications is equal to the number<BR>
of gun permit applications because we are allowed "up to 10 firearms"<BR>
for the same fee.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the following secnarios to consider are :<BR>
<BR>
1- the bureaucrats really believed the 85 million figure  -- and they<BR>
were going to bilk gun owners out of an extra 100 million dollars right<BR>
from the start, more than twice what they actually "needed";<BR>
<BR>
2- the bureaucrats have known for a long time that the fee schedule they<BR>
published covers only half of the actual costs of 360 millions. Just as<BR>
they stalled and stonewalled and denied for as long as possible the true<BR>
extent of their spendings, they are also stalling and stonewalling on<BR>
the real fees they will have to charge to cover their lavish lifestyle.<BR>
<BR>
I doubt very much scenario 1 is true -- the bureaucrats could not be so<BR>
naive, the Surete du Quebec itself will set up a staff of up 200 at the<BR>
cost of 40 millions, close to half the 85 million total. Scenario 2<BR>
shows we cannot believe Ottawa's fee structure anymore than we can<BR>
believe its total cost estimates nor its crime statistics.<BR>
<BR>
In a nutshell:<BR>
- - The bureaucrats could not do it for 85 mmillions.<BR>
- - The bureaucrats cannot do it for 360 millions. (at that point, only<BR>
gone through the motions, unvalidated registry).<BR>
- ---&gt; The fees cannot remain at the original level promised at the<BR>
beginning.<BR>
