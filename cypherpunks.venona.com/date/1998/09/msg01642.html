Data Fellows to integrate BackWeb's technology into CounterSign architecture 


Helsinki, Finland, September 25, 1998 - Data Fellows Ltd., a leading data
security vendor, and BackWeb Technologies, a leader in push solutions for
Knowledge Distribution, today announced an agreement to integrate BackWeb’s
Polite Server and Agent technology into Data Fellows’ CounterSign
management architecture. The CounterSign architecture provides a scalable,
policy-based framework for managing the security infrastructure. 

By including BackWeb technology in Data Fellows products, protection
against security breaches reaches the highest level, as the security system
will automatically and transparently keep itself up-to-date during idle
time online. BackWeb’s solution will complement the existing Internet
update technology in F-Secure security products, which include F-Secure
Workstation Suite, F-Secure Anti-Virus, F-Secure FileCrypto, F-Secure VPN+,
F-Secure SSH and F-Secure NameSurfer. 

"Combining our integrated security solutions with BackWeb’s Polite
distribution technology provides clear benefits to corporate customers in
today’s insecure Internet environments," said Risto Siilasmaa, President
and CEO of Data Fellows. "The use of bandwidth-friendly and scaleable push
technology is a natural extension of our strong Internet approach." 

F-Secure utilizes BackWeb’s new client, which allows data transfer to
customer networks securely even through firewalls. Administrators of
corporate networks will be able to make the decision about deploying a
particular version update in their networks, on a case-by-case basis, if
they prefer to evaluate the updates before deployment. This type of
implementation ensures that customers always have the latest versions on
hand and are able to follow company security policy on software
distribution. Data Fellows will also utilize the BackWeb broadcast channel
for delivering alerts as well as relevant product service and support
information to the corporate administrators and to its partners world-wide. 

Data Fellows’ future plans include establishing partnerships with ISPs for
using BackWeb’s push technology and its down- and upstream capabilities to
enable ISPs to find new sources of revenue from value-added services, such
as well-managed security services.
