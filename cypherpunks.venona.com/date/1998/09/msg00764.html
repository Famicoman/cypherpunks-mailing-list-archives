September 17, 1998 Web posted at: 11:16 AM EDT (1516 GMT)

MIAMI (AP) -- The shadowy world of a low-budget Cuban spy ring came to
light in a courtroom, where an FBI agent testified that a suspect's
apartment yielded computer diskettes containing coded references to Fidel
Castro and plans to sabotage an aircraft hangar.

Sounding more and more like a spy novel, details of the group's workings
were revealed in a hearing at which Luis Medina and Manuel Viramontez were
ordered held without bail Wednesday.

Thousands of pages of encrypted computer documents were seized from the
men's apartments.

The men were among 10 rounded up over the weekend and charged Monday with
trying to penetrate U.S. military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro exile
groups and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations. Prosecutors
said it was the biggest Cuban spy ring uncovered in the United States since
Castro took power in 1959.

However, the Pentagon said none of the alleged spies obtained U.S. secrets.

Evidence seized from Viramontez "analyzes the ability to sabotage or cause
damage to airplanes" or a Florida hangar itself," FBI agent Mark de Almeida
testified.

But the network was a low-budget affair, with a Cuban military captain who
lived under the alias Viramontez falling behind on his rent.

The Cuban government "indicated they were supposed to suffer like the rest
of the Cuban people," de Almeida testified in explaining their spartan
lifestyle.

He said diskettes seized from Viramontez' apartment were sprinkled with the
word "comrade" and coded references to "commandante," taken by
investigators to refer to Castro.

Before Viramontez was caught, he had three sets of false identities and
plans to escape to Mexico, Nicaragua or Canada, prosecutors allege. Medina,
said to be a Cuban intelligence major, was ready to flee with a briefcase
containing Puerto Rican identities, a fake birth certificate and $5,000 in
cash.

Eight defendants postponed their bail hearings Wednesday. All 10 were in
solitary confinement at a federal jail.

Viramontez's attorney Paul McKenna said the court, not public opinion, must
decide the case.

"You can't have a lynch mob mentality about this case," said McKenna. "We
have to let our system of justice, our courts, deal with this."
