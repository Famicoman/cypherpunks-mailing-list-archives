                                 This is it folks.

             This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately
 
   Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below , to see if it really can make people money.  If you saw it, you know that their conclusion was ,that while most people did not make the $55,000, as discussed in the plan, EVERYONE who followed the instructions was able to make 100 to 160 times their money at the VERY LEAST . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program.

This is one of the most exciting opportunities with the MOST income potential on the internet today!" --48 Hours..
Hi, my name is Fred. After I saw this letter aired on the news program,I decided to get some of my skeptical questions answered.
Does it really work? Until I try it, I can only go on the testimony of people I don't know,so I will only know if I try it. I've never done this type of thing, but I decided
it was time to try something. If I keep doing what I am doing I'll keep getting what I've got.  Besides, people 70 years old have been surveyed and they will consistently say
that the 2 regrets they have of there lives are;
they wish they had spent more time with their families and
 
they wish they had taken more chances.

Upon hearing this again,and hearing what the MEDIA said about it, I decided that at 34, I was going to take a small chance and see what would come of it.
Is it legal? - Yes, (Refer to title 18, Section 1302 &amp; 1342 of the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws)
 
This opportunity isn't much of a risk and could turn out to actually be a bit of fun.

Bottom Line;

The risk is only $20 and time on the Internet.

The following is a copy of the letter that the media was referring to:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY
 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product that they paid us $5.00 US for, that costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail back to them. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online 
(via your computer).
 
The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive is to include:



  $5.00 cash United States Currency
 
 * The name and number of the report they are ordering

 * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.


 
To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer. 
THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours! 
This is the electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere!
 
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND

BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!

I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S 
This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).

     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE

       REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR

      RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose

         name appears on the list next to the report.
 
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four
 
         reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can save them

         on your computer and resell them.

     *  Within a few days you are to receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports.

         Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send

          to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.
 

 
2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next  to

each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is  instructed
 
below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.    

Once you  understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. 

Remember, this method  has been tested,
 
and if you alter it, it will not work.
 
a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.


b. After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address under
 
REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the one that was there

down to REPORT #2.

c.Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to .
 
REPORT #3


d. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to

REPORT#4
 
e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
 
the list and has NO DOUBT collected large sums of cash!
 
Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!
 
 
3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save  it to

your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this  letter.
 
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
 
WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB can be very, very inexpensive,

and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another avenue which

you could use for advertising is e-mail lists. You can buy these lists for under

$20/2,000 addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you.
 
BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!
 
5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report

they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL

ORDERS! This will help guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR

name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't  advertise until

they receive the report!  To grow fast be prompt and courteous.

--------------------------------------   
 
AVAILABLE REPORTS
 
---------------------------------------

Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME

Notes:
 
 -  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT
 
 -  ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA THE QUICKEST DELIVERY
 
 -  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper

 -  On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the number &amp; name of the report you are ordering, (b) your     
    e-mail address, and (c) your postal address.

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level.  (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.)  Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................................$50
 
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500

3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
 
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
 
                                                THIS TOTALS        -----------&gt;$55,550 

 Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a  moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Lots of people get 100s of participants!

 THINK ABOUT IT!

 Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20).  You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!  shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!

About 50,000 new people get online every month

 
 
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
 
*  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately.

*  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when

the orders start coming in because:
 
When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested   product/report to comply

  with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title  18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005
 
 in the U.S. Code   also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state
 
 that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."


 
*ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.        

 

*Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the

instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!


*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
 
 
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE

Follow these guidelines to help assure your success:
 
 If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 50 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 50 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash can continue to roll in!
 
 
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
 

 Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!

NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name,  how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.   If you have any question of the legality of this letter contact the Office of Associate Director for Marketing Pratices Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Consumer Protection in Washington DC.

      This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.

     The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 19 weeks, with money still coming in.

            Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.
 
 

     I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I didn'tdelete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!

      This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!

I am nearing the $90,000 mark from this program.I have used several forms of

  advertisement.I used regular mail and bulk e-mail.  The regular mail that I used
  
  was very expensive for two reasons. I purchased a very select list of names
 
  and the postage. The third time I sent e-mails out,I did so in the quantity of
 
  1 million. So, after 3 times participating in this program I am almost at the
 
  $90,000 mark. That isn't too bad. I hope the same success for you. .
 
  Good Luck.
