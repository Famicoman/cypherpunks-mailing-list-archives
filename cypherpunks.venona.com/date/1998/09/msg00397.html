1. it's tough to argue that clinton's apparent perjury in Jones was
immaterial

2. i know of no law saying perjury only a crime if it's "material"

3. perjury is certainly one of the "great offenses" that common law says
is impeachable.

4. besides, non-criminal activities can constitute impeachable offenses --
look at second and third articles of impeachment in Nixon's case

&gt; &gt; &gt; If they &lt;do&gt; decide this is now a requirement for high office, I'd like
&gt; &gt; &gt; to see all the Congresscritters who've had sex out of wedlock and
&gt; &gt; &gt; concealed it take one step forward.  Shall we make hypocrisy in high
&gt; &gt; &gt; office impeachable also?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A better question is: If Clinton is guilty of perjury and other felonies,
&gt; &gt; should he be impeached?
&gt; 
&gt; IANAL (feel free to weigh in here, Unicorn), but I heard on one show or
&gt; another that lying under oath is perjury only if it's material to the
&gt; suit.  Since the Jones case was dismissed, it was argued that even if he
&gt; lied then, it wasn't material and thus wasn't perjury -- they claimed that
&gt; nobody had every been convicted of perjury for lying in a case that was
&gt; dismissed.  Of course he's saying he didn't even lie: like Kinky Friedman
&gt; and the Texas Jewboys, as espoused in their legal treatise "Waitret, please
&gt; waitret, come sit on my face", he believes that "Eatin' ain't cheatin'."
&gt; YMMV.
&gt; 
&gt; In any case, despite these legalisms, I'm not convinced that perjury in
&gt; any case should be considered treason or high crimes and misdemeanors.
&gt; The Founding Fathers could have been more specific about what was
&gt; impeachable, and they chose not to be, leaving it intentionally ambiguous.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite those arguments, this stuff really isn't about perjury: it's about
&gt; the Republicans' case of nixon envy... Clinton's peccadillos are a far cry
&gt; from Watergate (or Teapot Dome or Iran-Contra), but it's the best chance
&gt; they've had since the Crook was dumped.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you don't think about lying about sex and related issues under oath
&gt; &gt; should be a crime, well, then change the law. But right now any form of
&gt; &gt; lying under oath is perjury, whether you like it or not. 
&gt; 
&gt; If he did commit perjury, would that be an impeachable offense?  I claim
&gt; it's up to the House to interpret just what constitutes high crimes and
&gt; misdemeanors, since it isn't spelled out in the Constitution.
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer -- I'm not a Democrat, and I'm annoyed with Clinton's behavior
&gt; on crypto issues.  If I appear to be defending him, it's inadvertant -- I
&gt; just feel he should be attacked on material points rather than whatever
&gt; sleazy stuff Starr has found under his rocks.
