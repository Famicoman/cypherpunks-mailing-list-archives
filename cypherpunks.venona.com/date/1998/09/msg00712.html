Digital Biometrics Awarded Rhode Island State Contract 

      DBI Tenprinter 1133S Systems Selected For Rhode Island's Live-Scan
                                Fingerprinting

   MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Biometrics, Inc. (Nasdaq:
DBII) a leader in biometric identification systems integration company,
today announced the award of the Rhode Island State contract for an initial
order of six TENPRINTER 1133S live-scan fingerprinting systems.  These
systems will enable police agencies to eliminate the need for the
traditional ink method of taking fingerprints, and significantly speed
fingerprint processing of criminal and suspected criminal fingerprints with
a higher degree of accuracy.
 
    Live-scan systems such as the 1133S are special-purpose computer-based
systems which capture, digitize and transmit fingerprint images, and
provide a significant improvement in image quality and ease-of-use compared
to the traditional ink-based method of taking fingerprints.  Live-scan
systems are used in law enforcement and increasingly in non-law enforcement
applications such as employment screening, new employee enrollment,
firearms registration, and security screening.

    James C. Granger, President and Chief Executive Officer of Digital
Biometrics commented, "We are very pleased that Rhode Island has chosen DBI
for their fingerprinting network.  Rhode Island joins the growing list of
states that have chosen our live-scan technology." 

    Rhode Island joins Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Connecticut, Oregon, Nevada, Alabama, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Colorado, California and Virginia as recent U.S. purchasers of
Digital Biometrics TENPRINTER Series live-scan fingerprinting systems.
Digital Biometrics also supplies live-scan systems to the Scottish Criminal
Records Office and has recently won an OEM agreement with TRW for England
and Wales. 

    Digital Biometrics is a provider of biometric identification systems
and systems integration services. DBI is a leading supplier of computer
systems-based products and services for fingerprint capture for law
enforcement and commercial applications. In addition, its Integrated
Identification Solutions Division delivers total solutions through
customized applications and product integration to solve complex
information systems
problems, including identification problems, in commercial and government
markets.
