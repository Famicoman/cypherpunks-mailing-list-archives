Date: Thu, 24 Sep 1998 10:22:34 -0600<BR>
From: "David BREWERTON" &lt;<FONT COLOR=0000ff><U>brewerd@shaw.wave.ca<FONT COLOR=000000 DEFAULT="COLOR"></U>&gt;<BR>
Subject: FedUp II rally<BR>
<BR>
To the Editor, Halifax Herald:<BR>
Regarding your "Sticking to their guns" article. I would like to correct<BR>
a few inaccuracies in your piece.<BR>
1&gt; "..to join about 8,000 others at the Fed Up II Rally.." - the RCMP<BR>
estimate was 30,000 people, one of the largest if not THE largest rally<BR>
ever on Parliament Hill.<BR>
<BR>
2&gt;"The new law, Bill C-68, will come into effect on Dec. 1, two months<BR>
after it was first scheduled to be implemented." NO, this is the FIFTH<BR>
extension of it's implementation date, now totalling three years.<BR>
<BR>
3&gt;"Ms. McLellan said the delay was at the request of Ontario law     <BR>
enforcement officials and not due to problems with the federal       <BR>
government's new system." FALSE, only 8 days before the law was<BR>
scheduled to go into effect, gun dealers and Police departments still do<BR>
not have the information on how to comply with the law. Confirm this<BR>
with the Provincial Firearms Officers - they don't have the information<BR>
yet. The fault is Federal. I asked gun dealers here and confirmed this<BR>
with them, they still have nothing from the Federal government.<BR>
<BR>
4&gt;"Ms. McLellan said the program is still expected to cost about $185<BR>
million over the first five years" NO, they've already spent $135<BR>
million (that they'll acknowledge) THIS YEAR ALONE, and $250+ million so<BR>
far in 3 years before registering a single firearm and they claim $60<BR>
million annually to run it. That's impossible since the current handgun<BR>
registration system costs just under $100 per gun to register and with<BR>
estimates (RCMP) of up to 25 million guns in Canada, that's $2.5 BILLION<BR>
to do the job. Add to that the $200 million the Canadian Police<BR>
Association must have to upgrade it's computer system to use the data<BR>
from this system, the price is now somewhere around $3 Billion. That<BR>
would help a lot of Hep-C victims and cancer patients.<BR>
<BR>
5&gt;"The minister also denied the government has a secret agenda to <BR>
confiscate everyone's guns and use the registry to let the police know<BR>
where to find firearms." False, since the goverment has already<BR>
announced that they're turning 58% of the legitimately owned handguns in<BR>
Canada into prohibited firearms and confiscating them without<BR>
compensation. (Also illegal under the Charter of Rights) As for the<BR>
Police access to the information - that was the main selling point by<BR>
the Liberals to get the Canadian Police Chiefs to agree to support it.<BR>
They were to have this information before going into a house to be<BR>
prepared for any eventuality. They've now been informed that the system<BR>
won't give them that information. The support of main line Police<BR>
officers doesn't exist either. 85-91% of officers surveyed in several<BR>
provinces (where their leaders would allow the survey to be done) say<BR>
that they don't support the law.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please, lets keep the facts straight on this. There are 7 million people<BR>
in this country who own firearms (RCMP estimates) and they're all voters<BR>
and taxpayers. The utter waste of some $3 Billion on something with<BR>
early estimates of a minimum 50% error rate (from the Ministers Select<BR>
group of firearms experts) that will do nothing to combat crime since<BR>
criminals won't register their guns and 90% of firearms crime (RCMP<BR>
figures) is done with unregistered handguns which have had mandatory<BR>
registration since 1934, cannot be tolerated. The NFA put together a<BR>
system of firearm owner licensing some 30 years ago that would take care<BR>
of most of what the government theoretically wants to accomplish with a<BR>
very low cost. They refuse to consider it. The existing handgun registry<BR>
has an estimated 30-45% error rate and even the courts refuse to accept<BR>
data from it in court since it's so inaccurate. <BR>
The Federal government can't even get their figures straight, since<BR>
their numbers don't match either the RCMP or StatsCan figures for crime<BR>
rates. They were caught inflating RCMP crime figures by 900% to<BR>
strengthen their case in the Alberta Court of Appeal. They used the<BR>
argument that even if a firearm was present at a location (locked in a<BR>
gun safe and not involved in the crime) then it was a firearm crime.<BR>
That's like saying that if there's a domestic dispute in a home and<BR>
there's a car in the driveway then it's an automobile accident. That<BR>
doesn't wash with me, I don't know about you.<BR>
Please, lets keep the facts straight so that your readers can make an<BR>
accurate assessment of the news, not a distorted one.<FONT COLOR=000000 DEFAULT="COLOR"><BR>
