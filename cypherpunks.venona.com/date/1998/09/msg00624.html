Separation of church and state was established by jefferson not as a
quote from the constitution but as a summary of the religious parts of
it.  It was written in a letter to baptists in massachusets.  He also
sent a copy of it to his postmaster general and attorney general for
proofreading to make sure it was a legal summary and correct.  You can
find this info on the internet.

&gt; hey, would you care to show us where "seperation of church and
state" is
&gt; to be found in the constitution/bill of rights?  absolute right and
&gt; wrong is not a religious belief (necessarily)..  your religious
beliefs
&gt; do not affect the nature of reality.  there are absolute truths by
&gt; necessity...  see, there is NO WAY that there could not be.  Because
if
&gt; there were no absolute truths, then that would mean that NOTHING is
&gt; absolute.  That statement in itself is an absolute.  now, as for
&gt; absolute truths regarding the president, there may or may not be any
as
&gt; far as most people are concerned.  people always seem to make an
&gt; exception for people who agree with them...  in order to be an
effective
&gt; president, however, one must uphold the very basis of this country, by
&gt; upholding the law.  Clinton perjured himself, obstructed justice, and
&gt; tampered with witnesses in a grand jury investigation (which was
&gt; incidentally &lt;sp?&gt; being conducted by a man who was praised just
months
&gt; earlier as unbiased and very qualified for the job).  The man is
&gt; supposed to be the figurehead for our system of gov't.  If he cannot
&gt; follow the law, then he is not fit for the office.

&gt; &gt; Ever heard of seperation of church and state? Democracy? the
rights of
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the individual?  While you certainly have the right to practice your
&gt; &gt; religion in what ever manner you so choose demanding that everyone
&gt; &gt; else
&gt; &gt; does, or that the president of the us of ais subject to you PERSONAL
&gt; &gt; faith decisions is outragous
