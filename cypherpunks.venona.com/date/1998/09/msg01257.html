                    The Clinton 'body count'
                    New alarm over growing list
                    of dead close to president
 
                    By Michael Rivero
                    Copyright 1998, WorldNetDaily.com
 
                    "Dear Sir," began Monica Lewinsky's
                    somewhat peevish letter of July 3rd,
                    1997. In it, according to the recently
                    released report by Kenneth Starr, the
                    former intern chided the president for
                    failing to secure for her a new White
                    House job, and hinted that continued
                    stalling would result in word of their
                    affair leaking out.
 
                    The next day, Monica confronted Bill
                    Clinton in an Oval Office meeting she
                    described as "very emotional"; a meeting
                    which ended when the president warned
                    her, "It's illegal to threaten the
                    president of the United States."
 
                    Three days later, another former White
                    House intern, Mary Mahoney, was shot five
                    times in the back of the Georgetown
                    Starbuck's she managed. Two of her
                    co-workers were also killed. Even though
                    cash remained in the register, the triple
                    murder was quickly dismissed as a botched
                    robbery. No suspects have ever been
                    arrested.
 
                    Coincidence? Maybe.
 
                    Former Democratic National Committee
                    fundraiser and Commerce Secretary Ron
                    Brown was under criminal investigation.
                    Indictments seemed imminent. Ron Brown
                    had reportedly told a confidante that he
                    would, "not go down alone." Days later,
                    his plane crashed on approach to
                    Dubrovnik airport during a trade mission
                    excursion to Croatia. Military forensics
                    investigators were alarmed by what
                    appeared to be a .45-caliber bullet hole
                    in the top of Brown's head.
 
                    Coincidence? Maybe.
 
                    Yet another fundraiser was Larry
                    Lawrence, famed for his short residence
                    at Arlington National Cemetery. Less well
                    known is that he had been under criminal
                    investigation by the State Department for
                    three weeks when he died.
 
                    Coincidence? Maybe.
 
                    But for a growing number of Americans,
                    the sheer numbers of strange deaths
                    surrounding the career of Bill Clinton
                    has begun to raise serious questions. In
                    a meeting with Vernon Jordan, Monica
                    Lewinsky reportedly expressed fears that
                    she might, "end up like Mary Mahoney,"
                    and began to make sure that others knew
                    of her affair with Bill Clinton.
 
                    Of all the strange deaths surrounding the
                    Clintons, none has come under more
                    renewed scrutiny than the fate of White
                    House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster, who
                    was found dead in Fort Marcy Park on July
                    20, 1993. The official investigation
                    concluded that Foster inserted a gun into
                    his mouth and pulled the trigger. Yet
                    according to the lab results neither
                    Foster's fingerprints nor blood was on
                    the gun, nor were powder granules or
                    bullet fragments traceable to that gun in
                    his wounds. The purported "suicide note"
                    was found to be a forgery by three
                    independent experts. The record of a
                    second wound on Foster's neck, and an FBI
                    memo that contradicts the official
                    autopsy, strongly suggests that Foster's
                    wounds were misrepresented in the
                    official report. The FBI's own records
                    revealed that deliberate deception was
                    used to link Foster with the gun found
                    with his body. Partly on the basis of
                    that evidence, the FBI is now in federal
                    court on charges of witness harassment
                    and evidence tampering in the case.
 
                    In normal police procedure, homicide is
                    assumed right from the start. Suicide
                    must be proven, because homicides are
                    often concealed behind phony suicides.
                    Yet in the case of Foster, serious doubts
                    persist regarding the credibility of the
                    evidence offered up in support of the
                    claim of suicide, and a recent Zogby Poll
                    revealed that more than two-thirds of all
                    Americans no longer think the official
                    conclusion of suicide is believable
 
                    The official conclusion regarding
                    Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's death was
                    that his plane was brought down by, "the
                    worst storm in a decade." However, the
                    Dubrovnik airport weather office, just
                    two miles from the crash site, could not
                    confirm the existence of any such storm,
                    nor did any other pilots in the area.
                    According to the April 8, 1996, Aviation
                    Week &amp; Space Technology, three separate
                    radio links to the aircraft all quit
                    while the aircraft was still seven miles
                    from the crash, evidence that the plane
                    suffered a total electrical failure in
                    flight which was never investigated. The
                    perfectly cylindrical hole in Ron Brown's
                    skull never triggered an autopsy. After
                    Ron Brown's death, his co-worker, Barbara
                    Wise, was found locked in her office at
                    the Department of Commerce, dead,
                    bruised, and partially nude. Following
                    Brown's death, John Huang's new boss at
                    Commerce was Charles Meissner, who
                    shortly thereafter died in yet another
                    plane crash.
 
                    These and other questionable deaths have
                    been collected together in a document
                    known as the "Dead Bodies List," which
                    can now be found in many locations on the
                    World Wide Web. Some of the cases are
                    poorly documented and have been dismissed
                    until now as "conspiracy theory."
                    However, analysis of the "Dead Bodies
                    List" by experts on the Internet revealed
                    that in many cases, deaths whose
                    circumstances demanded an investigation
                    had been ignored.
 
                    Some events officially declared to be
                    accidents seem to stretch the bounds of
                    credulity. In one case, Stanley Heard,
                    member of a Clinton advisory committee
                    and chiropractor to Clinton family
                    members, and his lawyer Steve Dickson
                    were flying to a meeting with a reporter.
                    Heard's private plane caught fire, but he
                    was able to make it back to his airport
                    and rent another plane to continue his
                    journey. The rented plane then caught
                    fire. This time, Heard did not make it
                    back to the airport. Gandy Baugh,
                    attorney for Clinton friend and convicted
                    cocaine distributor Dan Lasater, fell out
                    of a building. Baugh's law partner was
                    dead just one month later. Jon Parnell
                    Walker, an RTC investigator looking into
                    Whitewater, interrupted his inspection of
                    his new apartment to throw himself off of
                    the balcony.
 
                    Nor does the pattern of suspicious deaths
                    discriminate by gender. Susan Coleman was
                    reportedly a mistress to Clinton while he
                    was Arkansas attorney general; she was
                    seven months pregnant with what she
                    claimed was Clinton's child when she
                    died. Judy Gibbs, a former Penthouse Pet
                    and call girl, reportedly counted Bill
                    Clinton among her clients. Shortly after
                    agreeing to help police in an
                    investigation into Arkansas cocaine
                    trafficking, Judy burned to death. Kathy
                    Ferguson, a witness in the Paula Jones
                    case, was killed with a gunshot behind
                    the ear and was declared a suicide, even
                    though her suitcases had all been packed
                    for an immediate trip. One month later,
                    Bill Shelton, Kathy's boyfriend and a
                    police officer who had vowed to get to
                    the bottom of Kathy's murder, was also
                    dead of a gunshot, his body dumped on
                    Kathy's grave.
 
                    Another alarming trend observed in these
                    deaths is how society's safeguards
                    against murder appear to have been
                    compromised. Many of the questionable
                    deaths involved either negligence or the
                    complicity of medical examiners.
 
                    Dr. Fahmy Malek was the Arkansas medical
                    examiner under then-Gov. Bill Clinton.
                    His most famous case involved his ruling
                    in the "Train Deaths" case of Don Henry
                    and Kevin Ives in which Dr. Malek ruled
                    that the two boys had fallen asleep on
                    the railroad tracks and been run over by
                    a train. A subsequent autopsy by another
                    examiner found signs of foul play on both
                    the boys' bodies and concluded that they
                    had been murdered. According to Jean
                    Duffey, the prosecutor in the Saline
                    County Drug Task Force, the two boys
                    accidentally stumbled onto a "protected"
                    drug drop and were killed for it. Dan
                    Harmon, the Arkansas investigator who
                    concluded there was no murder, is now in
                    prison on drug charges. Despite the
                    evidence for murder and national
                    exposure, the Henry/Ives case has never
                    officially been re-opened, and Jean Duffy
                    has since left Arkansas out of fear for
                    her life. Several witnesses in the
                    Henry/Ives case later died and were ruled
                    as either suicides or natural causes by
                    Dr. Malek, whose willingness to provide
                    an innocuous explanation for these deaths
                    is illustrated in one case where he
                    claimed that a headless victim had died
                    of natural causes. Malek claimed that the
                    victim's small dog had eaten the head,
                    which was later recovered from a trash
                    bin. When pressed to fire Dr. Malek, Gov.
                    Clinton excused the medical examiner's
                    performance as the result of overwork and
                    gave him a raise.
 
                    Dr. Malek's Washington D.C. counterpart
                    was Fairfax, Virginia, Medical Examiner
                    James C. Beyer. Long before his autopsy
                    on Vincent Foster, Beyer's work was
                    disputed. In the case of Tim Easely,
                    Beyer ignored obvious defensive wounds,
                    and eyewitness reports of an argument
                    between Easely and his girlfriend, to
                    conclude that Easely had committed
                    suicide by stabbing himself in the chest.
                    When an outside expert called attention
                    to the fact that Easely had been stabbed
                    clear through one of his palms, the
                    girlfriend confessed to the murder. In
                    the case of Tommy Burkett, Beyer ignored
                    signs of violence done to Burkett to rule
                    it was a simple suicide. A subsequent
                    autopsy showed that Beyer had not even
                    done the work he claimed in his original
                    autopsy. Even though Beyer showed X-rays
                    to Burkett's father, Beyer later claimed
                    they did not exist. When Beyer performed
                    the Foster autopsy, he wrote in his
                    report that X-rays had been taken, then
                    again claimed they never existed when
                    asked to produce them.
 
                    In some cases, the deaths simply have no
                    innocuous explanation, One witness, Jeff
                    Rhodes (who had information on the
                    Henry/Ives murders) was found with his
                    hands and feet partly sawn off, shot in
                    the head, then burned and thrown in a
                    trash bin. Another obvious murder was
                    Jerry Parks, Clinton's head of security
                    in Little Rock. Immediately following
                    news of Foster's death, Parks reportedly
                    told his family, "Bill Clinton is
                    cleaning house." Just weeks after the
                    Parks' home had been broken into and his
                    files on Clinton stolen, Parks was shot
                    four times in his car.
 
                    Ron Miller, on whose evidence Nora and
                    Gene Lum were convicted of laundering
                    Clinton campaign donations, went from
                    perfect heath to death in just one week
                    in a manner so strange that his doctors
                    ordered special postmortem tests. The
                    results of those tests have never been
                    released, but toxicologists familiar with
                    the case suggest that Miller's symptoms
                    are consistent with Ricin, a cold war
                    assassin's poison.
 
                    For a fortunate few the murder attempts
                    have failed. In the case of Arkansas drug
                    investigator Russell Welch, his doctors
                    were able to identify that he had been
                    infected with military anthrax in time to
                    save his life. Gary Johnson, Gennifer
                    Flowers' neighbor whose video
                    surveillance camera had accidentally
                    caught Bill Clinton entering Flowers'
                    apartment, was left for dead by the men
                    who took the video tape. Gary survived,
                    although he is crippled for life. L.J.
                    Davis, a reporter looking into the
                    Clinton scandals, was attacked in his
                    hotel room but survived (his notes on
                    Clinton were stolen). Dennis Patrick,
                    whose bond trading account at Dan
                    Lasater's company was used to launder
                    millions of dollars of drug money, has
                    had four attempts on his life.
 
                    But the real importance of the "Dead
                    Bodies List" isn't what it tells us of
                    modern political intrigues, but what it
                    tells us of ourselves, in how we respond
                    to it. The list has been around for quite
                    some time, largely ignored by the general
                    public, completely ignored by the
                    mainstream media. The common reaction has
                    been that such a list is unbelievable,
                    not for its contents, but for its
                    implications. For that reason, most
                    Americans have, until recently, accepted
                    at face value the official assurances
                    that all these deaths are isolated
                    incidents with no real meaning; that all
                    the indications of foul play and cover-up
                    are just an accumulation of clerical
                    error and "overwork"; that it's all just
                    "coincidence."
 
                    On Aug. 17, as Bill Clinton admitted his
                    "inappropriate relationship" with Monica
                    Lewinsky on nationwide television,
                    Americans began to confront the
                    unavoidable fact that this president and
                    his administration had lied to the public
                    about a rather trivial matter. Americans
                    came to realize that this president and
                    his administration could no longer safely
                    be assumed to have told the truth on more
                    serious matters.
 
                    In this new climate of doubt, the "Dead
                    Bodies List" has enjoyed a new vogue,
                    albeit a dark one. Talk radio discusses
                    it. Total strangers e-mail it to each
                    other. What was unthinkable a few months
                    ago has become all too plausible.
                    Political murder has come to America.
                    Those cases on the "Dead Bodies List"
                    where hard evidence directly contradicts
                    the official conclusion have come under
                    renewed scrutiny.
 
                    It takes courage for the average citizen
                    to accept that the government has lied to
                    them, for by doing so, the citizen also
                    accepts the obligation to do something
                    about it. Americans know beyond a doubt
                    that they have been lied to. Americans
                    are discovering that they cannot ignore
                    the fact of being lied to without
                    sacrificing that part of the American
                    self-image that holds honor and justice
                    as ideals. But as the above poll would
                    suggest, such a sacrifice is no longer
                    acceptable.
