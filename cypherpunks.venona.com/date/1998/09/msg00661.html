&gt; Thanks for the reply.  I have now received about 10 such replies.  We
&gt; will take them to heart, remove the cypherpunks and attempt to deal with
&gt; the mailing list issue in an intelligent way.
&gt; 
&gt; And thanks, but we have enough magazine subscriptions already.  :)

&gt; &gt; OK, here's what happened.  Someone signed up for sixdegrees using one or
&gt; &gt; more of the cypherpunks addresses as their address, either deliberately in
&gt; &gt; order to cause problems like this, or accidentally, not realizing what
&gt; &gt; would happen.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The real-world analogy would be for me and all my friends to get a bunch of
&gt; &gt; magazines, rip out all those postage-paid subscription flaps, and fill out
&gt; &gt; your name and address on each of them, then you'd have unwanted trial
&gt; &gt; subscriptions to lots and lots of magazines.

&gt; &gt; Wouldn't that suck?  Can you imagine if 1000 people did that to you all the
&gt; &gt; same day?  (this is *not* a threat, just an example).  You'd have bags and
&gt; &gt; bags of zines and bills coming in daily...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I am sure you are aware, the net makes it REALLY EASY to screw someone
&gt; &gt; over like that, by signing them up for all sorts of things with little
&gt; &gt; effort.  Even if you remove all the cypherpunks addresses, someone can come
&gt; &gt; along and do it again.  There must be a permanent solution...how about
&gt; &gt; hardcoding a block on signing up with an address containing the string
&gt; &gt; "cypherpunks" in your email software?  Why should thousands of us on
&gt; &gt; cypherpunks all have to do our own filtering to delete everything from
&gt; &gt; @sixdegrees.com and still have to waste all that bandwidth when one site is
&gt; &gt; the source of all of it, and it could be eradicated with a simple
&gt; &gt; programming change?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I assure you this is not the last time you'll see this problem occur--there
&gt; &gt; are thousands of mailing lists out there, and lots of vindictive former
&gt; &gt; subscribers for each one that would love to annoy everyone on the list for
&gt; &gt; a while...  and signing a list up for sixdegrees does the trick quite
&gt; &gt; efficiently.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is confusing to me is that the email you received from sixdegrees
&gt; &gt; &gt; (with the subject:  Harald Fragner) is one that would be sent ONLY to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; CONFIRMED sixdegrees user.  That means that once upon a time, whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; you remember or not, you joined sixdegrees (as have over 1,000,000
&gt; &gt; &gt; people to date).  It also appears that you listed Harald Fragner as a
