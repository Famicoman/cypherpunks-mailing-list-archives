An interesting report from a GRU defector. How much of it is true? How
much is rehashed?

In any case, somebody must have cursed us, because we truly do live in
interesting times. Y2K, terrorism, busts of cypherpunks, martial law
contingency plans, a meltdown of Asian and Russian economies (with Latin
America apparently headed down the same drain), Asama bin Laden, VX nerve
gas, Ebola being developed in weapons labs, and on and on.

I'm glad I live far away from safe targets and have accumulated enough
supplies to "hunker" down for a long time.

There are two articles here, both interesting.

&gt; Colonel Stanislav Lunev, Russian GRU defector talks about the BACKPACK NUKES
&gt; on KSFO, Geoff Metcalf Show
&gt; 
&gt; KSFO 560 AM San Francisco, Geoff Metcalf Show
&gt; 
&gt; GUEST:Colonel Stanislav Lunev, Russian GRU defector, author of "Through the
&gt; Eyes of the Enemy"
&gt; 
&gt; SUMMARY OF LUNEV'S REMARKS
&gt; 
&gt; Boris Yelstin is a mafia tool, an alcoholic who has not at all decreased his
&gt; habit of drinking who "cannot appear more than one hour in public or he
&gt; looses control over himself". He is a "decoration of power" controlled by
&gt; criminals and industrial tycoons who rule Russia behind the scenes.
&gt; 
&gt; "Russia as Friend" is a theme slavishly pursued by breathless Western-types,
&gt; but in fact is an illusion. Only 2 months ago a large secret Soviet Air Base
&gt; conducted a very large-scale simulation of all-out nuclear with the West. A
&gt; similar exercise undertaken by Soviet Northern Fleet only 2 weeks ago.
&gt; 
&gt; In case of outbreak of war (something that Lunev sees as a greater danger
&gt; NOW than at any time in the past), portable containers of chemical,
&gt; biological, and nuclear for use by Spetnaz against command and control
&gt; centers, water and air supplies, and specific individuals in a "decapitory
&gt; strike"-type scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; Prior to hostilities, "students and businessmen" infiltrate into the US
&gt; using regular airlines, discard their disguises, and proceed to weapon
&gt; storage sites and then onto final targets.
&gt; 
&gt; 100 of these weapons are stored outside the former Soviet Union.
&gt; 
&gt; 57 main cells of industrial techno-snooping exist around the San Francisco
&gt; Bay Area.
&gt; 
&gt; In February ’97, Boris Yelstin gave a special order to Russian intelligence
&gt; to dramatically increase industrial espionage against the USA. Lunev
&gt; estimates that just in the last several years, espionage within America has
&gt; roughly doubled.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunev indicates that China and Russia have entered into substantial, formal
&gt; cooperation in their espionage efforts against the USA. He adds that in the
&gt; outbreak of war, both countries could fight together against America.
&gt; 
&gt; Metcalf closes by saying that Lunev's book can be ordered by calling
&gt; 1-888-606-0614.

&gt; 
&gt; The following scenario outlining typical Spetsnaz-type operations
&gt; prior to a Soviet main-force incursion into a foreign country comes
&gt; from unclassified U.S. government documents.
&gt; 
&gt; "An unconventional warefare scenario: The following hypothetical
&gt; scenario illustrates the employment concept for the full exploitation
&gt; of Soviet UW [unconventional warefare] assets.
&gt; 
&gt; "In support of a coordinated attack, air-dropped or air-landed GRU
&gt; special purpose teams would be introduced into their respective target
&gt; areas some days prior to H-hour. Special KGB sabotage teams would have
&gt; been infiltrated over a longer period of time by clandestine methods
&gt; to include the use of international commercial travel. These sabotage
&gt; teams could be prepared to begin their operations well before the
&gt; enemy's rear area security apparatus can be fully alerted. In the
&gt; pre-war period, some KGB personnel will seek to undermine national
&gt; resistance through political measures.
&gt; 
&gt; "Sabotage teams will begin isolated acts of sabotage such as
&gt; destroying a key bridge. In addition, KGB teams will attempt to create
&gt; chaos at major ports and distrupt communications.
&gt; 
&gt; "Shortly before D-day, additional sabotage teams will be inserted and
&gt; the majority of `sleeper agents' activated.
&gt; 
&gt; "Sabotage equipment can be smuggled into a country by any number of
&gt; secret methods and stored in hidden, but easily accessible, caches.
&gt; Smuggling techniques may include the offshore dropping of waterproof
&gt; containers from ships and submarines. In accordance with the
&gt; prearranged signals, they will be recovered and stored by clandestine
&gt; support personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; "Sensitive or fragil equipment (electronics material, detonators, and
&gt; communication devices) can be brought into the country by diplomatic
&gt; pouch and made available to the teams through established procedures.
&gt; 
&gt; "Teams will attempt tp place their explosives and incendiary devices
&gt; on the targets and set them to detonate at H-hour. All efforts will be
&gt; made to prevent association of these acts with the USSR in order to
&gt; maintain the element of surprise for the main attack. Immediately
&gt; prior to H-hour, the UW teams will prepare to:
&gt;   * Locate and destroy nuclear capable weaponry.
&gt;   * Jam radar installations.
&gt;   * Kidnap or assassinate key political-military leadership.
&gt;   * Seize or destroy radio and TV broadcasting facilities.
&gt; 
&gt; "At H-hour a wide spectrum of sabotage actions will be initiated."
