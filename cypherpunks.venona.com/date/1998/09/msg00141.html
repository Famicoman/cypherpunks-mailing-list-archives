&gt;    criminal threats to kill, injure, obstruct, impede, threaten and
&gt;    intimidate IRS

&gt;    and other Government employees. I have also conducted numerous
&gt;    investigations involving the use of computers and the Internet. Since

&gt;    Western District of Washington. In the investigation of Mr. Bell, it
&gt;    was discovered that he had posted a plan (titled "Assassination
&gt;    Politics") on the Internet, offering users of the Internet a method
&gt;    for anonymously funding the assassinations of IRS and other Government

&gt;    Internet group known as the "Cypherpunks." During the investigation of

This guy has experience with the Internet and doesn't know the difference
between a group and a mailing list, what a maroon.

&gt;    Bell I noted that Bell exchanged both private and public e-mail
&gt;    messages with an unidentified person using the name "Toto."

Implying Bell was under surveillance.

&gt;    residence. Shortly thereafter, a member of the Cypherpunks group
&gt;    stated via the Internet that he had obtained a copy of the warrant and
&gt;    return, and publicly posted them on the Internet.

And the point is?

&gt;    Bell was arrested and charged with Corruptly Obstructing and Impeding

So I can non-corruptly obstruct and impede?

&gt;    4. On June 23, 1997, an anonymous message was posted to the
&gt;    Cypherpunks Internet mailing list. [A "mailing list" consists of the

Well, finaly got the terms right.

&gt;    5. Based on my training and experience, I know that "Bot" is a slang
&gt;    term for an automated computer program. I also know that "e$" and
&gt;    "eCa$h" are slang terms for electronic or digital cash, which was a
...
&gt;    maker or indorser [as written]. [By analogy, digital cash is like a
&gt;    digital "poker chip" issued by a particular casino.]

Oh well, I knew he couldn't keep it straight.

&gt;    6. On September 4, 1997, a second message involving "Dead Lucky" was
&gt;    anonymously posted to the Cypherpunks group. This message stated in

This guy keeps using 'group' instead of 'mailing list', there is the
potential implication of conspiracy here...I wouldn't be surprised if just
about all of us weren't under surveillance at this point.

&gt;    8. On December 9, 1997, an anonymous message was posted to the
&gt;    Cypherpunks Internet mail group with the subject listed as "Encrypted
&gt;    InterNet DEATH THREAT!!! / ATTN: Ninth District Judges / PASSWORD:
&gt;    sog"[.] The body of the message was encrypted with the publicly
&gt;    available encryption software PGP, and was initially unreadable. Using
&gt;    PGP software and the password shown in the subject line of the
&gt;    message, I was able to decrypt the message, which contained a
&gt;    rambling, five-page statement, including the following:

&gt;      I can also be tied into Jim Bell's Worldwide Conspiracy to
&gt;      assassinate government authorities, through my implementation of an
&gt;      Assassination Bot ..."

See I told you there was a conspiracy buried in there somewhere!

&gt;    9. I noted that this message contained a PGP digital signature. From
&gt;    my training and experience, I am aware that this digital signature is
&gt;    used as a way to authenticate digital documents to make sure that they
&gt;    are authored by the purported author and that no one has tampered with
&gt;    them. When I checked the signature using only PGP software, the PGP
&gt;    program was unable to identify it.

&gt;    Only July 1, 1998, Royal Canadian
&gt;    Mounted Police (RCMP) Investigator Steve Foster provided me with a PGP
&gt;    "Secret Key Ring" which he stated he had obtained from a computer
&gt;    which Canadian Customs authorities had seized from an individual by
&gt;    the name of CARL EDWARD JOHNSON. [A "secret key ring" is a
&gt;    user-generated code which allows for the encryption (and later
&gt;    authentication) of computer-generated documents.] When I checked the
&gt;    digital signature on the Internet death threat using the PGP software
&gt;    and JOHNSON'S secret key ring, the computer identified the signature
&gt;    as one of the signature keys stored in JOHNSON'S computer. Because
&gt;    both the "private" and "public" portions of the "key" were stored on
&gt;    JOHNSON'S computer, the message can be authenticated as having been
&gt;    generated by the person who possessed this "secret key" and knew the
&gt;    correct password. In other words, only the person possessing the
&gt;    secret key found on JOHNSON'S computer could have generated the "death
&gt;    threat" message.

&gt;    10. I have also spoken by phone with Special Agent Jeremy Sheridan of
&gt;    the United States Secret Service. Sheridan told me that on July 31,
&gt;    1998, he located and interviewed Carl JOHNSON at 1800 West Magee, in
&gt;    Tucson, Arizona. The address belongs to a Linda Reed, who, according
&gt;    to Canadian police authorities, is a friend of JOHNSON'S. During this
&gt;    interview JOHNSON admitted that he often wrote on the Internet and
&gt;    among the names he used were Toto, C.J. Parker, and TruthMonger.
&gt;    Johnson also stated that he had been using the Internet account of
&gt;    Linda Reed. Sheridan showed JOHNSON a decrypted copy of the December
&gt;    9, 1997 Internet message entitled "Encrypted InterNet DEATH THREAT!!!
&gt;    / ATTN: Ninth district Court Judges / PASSWORD: sog." JOHNSON
&gt;    acknowledge that he wrote it. JOHNSON also stated that he had
&gt;    significant psychological problems.

Probably not a wise move, don't know about psychological problems but it
certainly demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

&gt;    bomb that was discovered in the basement of the Estevan courthouse on
&gt;    June 3, 1998. Block advised me that Carl JOHNSON has been formally
&gt;    charged with placing the bomb and that a warrant for his arrest has
&gt;    been issued in Canada. Block advised me that he believes that JOHNSON
&gt;    fled to the United States after placing the bomb in the Estevan
&gt;    courthouse.

That's impressive if true.

&gt;    15. On June 10, 1998, an anonymous message was posted to the
&gt;    Cypherpunks Internet group. In the message, it is stated that the
&gt;    bomber "placed the bomb before embarking on a middle-leg of the

So that's why he came to Austin?
