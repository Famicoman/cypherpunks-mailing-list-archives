SECTION 1: Personal Information 

Your Full Name:__________________________
 
Your eMail Address:_________________________

SECTION 3: Submission Information

Save Time and Delays by following our guidelines closely. If a length limit is exceeded (for example) we will have to ask you to shorten your information - thus delaying the process. Please do not type in ALL CAPS. 
NOTE: Each submission site has different submission forms. We will complete all available fields, however, all of the following information may not be listed at all sites. 
Company or Business name to include in submissions:
___________________________________________

Enter Your Web Page Title:_______________________________
 
NOTES: Your title should be no more than 40 CHARACTERS and include good keywords that describe the content of your Web page. Also, if you want it to appear near the top of alphabetically arranged lists and directories try and have the first letter of the title be an "A", "B", or "C" etc. Whatever you do, it should look like it belongs there or it may get chopped of by a site administrator. It doesn't necessarily have to match your actual Web Page title. In our opinion, it is redundant to include words such as "home page", "corporation" or other redundant words that are unlikely to be searched for, or that that unlikely to entice the viewer to click on YOUR title. You have only a few seconds to get a web surfers attention!
