I mention the alleged threats against the president in my article today,
and link to the email.

&gt; this message appears to refer to a visit from US Secret Service
&gt; agents, apparently due to their imputing some kind of threat to US
&gt; president(?) in one of Toto's rants.
&gt; 
&gt; Decrypted copy below [1].

&gt; ======================================================================
&gt; Secret Service With A Smile - SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!!
&gt; ___________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt;   It was only natural for me to wonder what it was about the Secret
&gt; Service Agents who visited me today that enabled them to act like
&gt; decent, pleasant people during the course of the personal interview
&gt; portion of their investigation into my life and psyche.
&gt; 
&gt;   The question was answered, to my satisfaction, at the point when
&gt; the more veteran of the two agents explained that, despite my
&gt; rugged handsomeness and my delightful personality, they would have
&gt; to CrushMeLikeABug if it became apparent to them that my already
&gt; tentative physical and mental existence came into conflict with
&gt; their official duty to protect the President of the United States.
&gt;   I realized that they were professionals, with a high degree of
&gt; integrity, and that their concern probably went far beyond the
&gt; fact that if the Nation lost the CommanderInChief on their shift,
&gt; they could pretty much kiss their Christmas Bonus goodbye...
&gt;   It was also apparent that their ability to be quite reasonable
&gt; and pleasant human beings--while making it plain that informing me
&gt; that putting me away for observation in Springfield, Missouri,
&gt; could easily take away a full year of my life, was *meant* to be
&gt; a threat--without having to engage in a heavy-handed affectation
&gt; of MachoAuthority, was the result of their actually *having* the
&gt; authority to decide, here and now, whether or not my life would
&gt; instantly become a living hell.
&gt; 
&gt;   The Secret Service Agents were also extremely intelligent, not
&gt; even blinking before passing on my offer to testify against myself,
&gt; in return for immunity from prosecution.
&gt;  (When I made the same offer to RCMP OffalSlurs, they had to 
&gt;   contact their superiors, who held a meeting with OffalSchills
&gt;   behind the closed doors of the Canadian Justice Apartment,
&gt;   before finally declining my offer.)
&gt; 
&gt;   I was able to relax and be cooperative in dealing with the 
&gt; Agents, since, when your fate is in the hands of someone with
&gt; GenuineAuthority, whether their intentions are GoodOrEvil (TM)
&gt; is not nearly as important as to whether or not they happen to
&gt; be StupidFucks (TM) who can ruin your life over something as
&gt; simple as misunderstanding your request that they make their
&gt; questions more 'lucid.'
&gt;  ("That's it, you sick, fucking pervert! Jim, get the kilo of
&gt;   heroin out of the trunk...")
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong Question #29 When Dealing With StupidFucks:
&gt;   "Excuse me, but do your employers *know* that you carry a gun?
&gt; I mean, have they ever met you, or were you hired by mail? Can
&gt; you actually shoot a gun without moving your lips?"
&gt; 
&gt;   Although the Secret Service Agents were in possession of an
&gt; email I had sent a few minutes or hours previously, from Pima
&gt; College --&gt; &lt;erehwon@dis.org&gt; (who I immediately tried to Rat
&gt; Out as the leader of a ChildSexRingDedicatedToTheViolentOver
&gt; ThrowOfTheUSGovernment, in order to save my own skin), the
&gt; agents seemed much more interested in a chapter of SAHMD!!!
&gt; which contains notification of an OfficialDeathThreat to pretty
&gt; much DoGodAndEverybodyOnTheFaceOfTheEarth.
&gt;   I tried to placate them by reaching over with a pen and adding
&gt; an 'Un' in front of the word 'Official,' but they were not really
&gt; impressed, informing me that the point they were trying to make
&gt; had to do with it being unacceptable, from their point of view,
&gt; for me to use the words 'Death,' 'Threat,' and 'President' all
&gt; in the same paragraph, let alone all in the same sentence.
&gt; {"Well, excuuusssee *me*!"}
&gt;   Realizing that it was probably not an opportune moment to try to
&gt; hit them up for a donation toward the maintenance of my planned
&gt; PresidentialDeathThreatAnonymousRemailer, I casually turned the
&gt; donation jar so that they couldn't see the label, and I set it
&gt; down.
&gt; 
&gt;   Actually, I couldn't be certain that I had actually written the
&gt; chapter, or portion thereof, with which the agents seemed most
&gt; concerned, since I find it difficult to distinguish between the
&gt; work that is mine alone, and the work that is a collage of various
&gt; participants in the writing and dissemination of 'The True Story
&gt; of the InterNet' manuscripts, if I don't have access to the files
&gt; on the computer on which they were created and stored.
&gt;   Nonetheless, I refrained from pointing out that the phrase that
&gt; indicates that the writer "might" conceivably "whack" someone or
&gt; another GovernmentPersonage, might equally apply to the stance
&gt; taken by the Secret Service Agents, themselves, if the Founding
&gt; Fathers were to be believed when they indicated that it is the
&gt; right and the duty of the citizenry to take up arms against their
&gt; rulers, if need be, in the interest of Democracy, Freedom, Justice,
&gt; or in DivineRetribution against the High&amp;Mighty if they take a drink
&gt; out of your beer while you're in the restroom, having a leak.
&gt;  (I'm not certain about that last example, but I have no doubt that
&gt;   the Founding Fathers *meant* to include that...)
&gt; 
&gt;   I refrained from attempting to engage the Agents in philosophical
&gt; debate in regard to some of the finer points surrounding the issues
&gt; of Freedom of Speech, since the purpose of their visit was obviously
&gt; geared toward impressing upon me the duties encompassed by their job
&gt; description, their professional competence in doing their job, and
&gt; the fact that the necessity of making a return visit would very
&gt; likely be an indication that Uncle Sam was about to become my new
&gt; landlord.
&gt;   To tell the truth, I was in a pretty scattered state of mind at
&gt; the time of their visit, and I undoubtedly failed to adequately
&gt; understand a good portion of the dialogue which took place, but
&gt; they were very clear in explaining that, given my current state
&gt; of unwelcomeness in Canada, I am running out of countries to go
&gt; to, and that I should give serious consideration as to whether or
&gt; not I wanted my next Literary Spamology to be titled, "Midnight 
&gt; Express II."
&gt;   Hhhmmm...decisions, decisions...
&gt; 
&gt;   Since my reading of the Secret Service Agents is that they are
&gt; highly ethical professionals, with little need to persecute an
&gt; individual out of thin-skinned, personal vindictiveness, I guess
&gt; it wouldn't hurt to mention that, minutes after their departure,
&gt; Linda Lou arrived home, announcing that there was yet another
&gt; Tarantula in the driveway, headed toward the house...
&gt; 
&gt;   The obvious conclusion, of course, is that the Secret Service
&gt; Agents are actually Reptilian Nazis, who are deeply involved in
&gt; the WorldWidePlotAgainstMe.
&gt;   This, in turn, leads to the dilemma of whether or not I should,
&gt; on the occasion of a return visit, jump them and drive wooden stakes
&gt; through their hearts, turning them into quivering pools of smoking,
&gt; green slime. 
&gt;  (Or is that Vampires? Shit! I'd better check, first, or it could
&gt;   lead to a really embarassing situation.)
&gt; 
&gt;   On the other hand, since they were quite civil and reasonable
&gt; in their dealings with me, and they apparently didn't eat any of
&gt; the dogs, while here (although it might have been a different
&gt; story, if we had poodles), then perhaps their is a chance that
&gt; we and the Reptilian Nazis can live together in peace...unless it
&gt; is a SneakyTrick (TM), of course...and they are trying to *confuse*
&gt; me, so that I don't warn TheOthers...and they were only so pleasant
&gt; because they were inwardly laughing at me for not realizing that,
&gt; starting tomorrow, they are going to take control of the whole face
&gt; of the globe, turning all humans into LobotomizedSlaves who exist
&gt; only to serve their ReptilianNaziMasters!
&gt; 
&gt; QUICK, EVERYBODY! ARM YOURSELVES AND RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!
&gt; PREPARE TO ENGAGE THE REPTILIAN NAZIS IN VIOLENT, BLOODY STRUGGLE!
&gt; START BY WHACKING OUT THE LAWYERS, AND THEN...
&gt; 
&gt;   Hold it! What the fuck am I ranting on about?
&gt;   The Masses are *already* LobotomizedSlaves who exist only to serve
&gt; their ReptilianNaziMasters...
&gt; 
&gt;   Maybe the agents were just here to see whether or not Baby is a
&gt; poodle.
&gt;   That makes more sense, since the Reptilian Nazis don't really 
&gt; give a FatRat'sAss about the Jews, but they *do* want to round up
&gt; all of the poodles shortly before the arrival of their Reptilian
&gt; Nazi Relatives, so that there is plenty of barbeque at their
&gt; PicnicToCelebrateTheConquestOfEarth.
&gt;   Yeah, that's gotta be it...
&gt; 
&gt;   Actually, I'm rather glad that the Secret Service Agents dropped
&gt; around to meet me in person, since people reading my copious literary
&gt; effluvia sometimes mistakenly get the impression that I am some kind
&gt; of Dogamned Weirdo, or something.
&gt;   Still, I wish I had been able to refrain from going, "Cuckoo-Cuckoo"
&gt; on the hour and the half-hour during their vist.
&gt;   But, what the hell...I bet that a *lot* of the people they visit
&gt; do that...
