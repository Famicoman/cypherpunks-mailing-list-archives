Germ sabotage scare empties city buildings
 The Courier-Mail - 12sep98

POLICE are investigating a possible attempt to sabotage a Brisbane city
building by putting the potentially deadly legionella bacteria in the
air-conditioner.

A canister suspected of containing the bacteria was found in the water
cooling system for the Mercantile Mutual building's air- conditioning unit
on Thursday.

Police suspect the canister was placed there deliberately because recent
routine tests on the Edward Street building's air-conditioning showed no
sign of the deadly bacteria in its system.

Det Snr-Sgt Bryan Paton said the maintenance company responsible for the
unit had not seen the canister when it previously checked the water cooling
tower.

"There is an indication that the device has been put in the water
deliberately and there is a concern there may have been some legionella
bacteria in the device and we have to wait for those results," Sgt Paton said.

"It wasn't a threat to the public or anybody and the air-conditioning
system has since been decontaminated but the concern is that someone has
done it deliberately. 

"At this stage we are treating it very seriously."

Police also are investigating how someone got access to the
air-conditioning unit. The canister sparked a mass evacuation of another
city building yesterday when it was delivered there by mistake. 

Maintenance workers delivered the canister to the Mercantile Mutual
building managers, whose offices are in the MLC building. 

The MLC building, in George Street, was evacuated about 2pm yesterday when
the canister, sealed in a metal container, was discovered by office staff.

Police and fire and ambulance crews were called to the scene and two
Queensland Fire Service officers wearing protective clothing removed the
canister.

The building was declared safe 90 minutes later and staff returned to work.
Insp John Flanagan said the evacuations were a precautionary measure and
the canister had been taken to the Government Chemical Laboratory for
analysis.

The company responsible for managing the MLC building refused to comment,
but a staff member said the scare had been blown out of proportion.

The bacteria needs a moist environment to develop into the water-borne
legionnaires' disease which can cause pneumonia, fever and death.

The disease is contracted by inhaling air contaminated by air-conditioning
cooling towers, or through whirlpool spas and showers containing
contaminated water.

The Australian upper limit for legionella bacteria in air- conditioning is
a colony count of 10,000. The Mercantile Mutual building had a colony count
of 2000. 

Sgt Paton said police did not know the reason for the possible sabotage and
no demands or threats had been made. "People maintaining the
air-conditioning units in other buildings should be aware of this and
ensure all proper precautions are made," Sgt Paton said.

Brisbane Southside Public Health Unit medical officer Brad McCall said
legionella was a very common bacterium found in creeks, ponds,
air-conditioning cooling towers and hot and cold water taps.
