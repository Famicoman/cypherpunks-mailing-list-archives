Introduction

EMGOLD MINING CORP. has made significant progress 
in bringing the historic Idaho-Maryland gold mine 
to a production decision.  Recent engineering studies 
indicate that less than half of the known gold has been 
extracted from the deposit, and that a 3,000,000 ounce 
resource remains to be mined.


History &amp; Past Production

The Idaho-Maryland gold mine was discovered in 1851, 
and was in nearly-continuous production from 1862 
through 1956.  Total recorded production from the mine 
was 2,383,000 ounces of gold from 5,546,000 tons of ore 
(0.43 oz/ton recovered grade).  When the mine closed in 
1956 due to escalating costs and the fixed price of gold 
of US$35/oz, mining operations were underway on 25 different 
faces on 6 different levels.


Large Mineralized System Defined - Extensive Infrastructure 
In Place The Idaho-Maryland vein system is 9,000 feet long, 
up to 3,000 feet wide, and has been partially-mined from 
surface to the 2000 foot level.  Access to the mine's 15 
working levels is provided by the three-compartment, 
3,460-foot deep New Brunswick Shaft.  Over 70 miles of 
underground tunnels and workings provide access to much 
of the property.


A Three Million Ounce Gold Resource Has Been Defined….
A 1992 study by James Askew and Associates Inc. estimated 
that the remaining gold resources and potential 
mineralization between the 2000 and 3280 levels of the 
Idaho-Maryland mine are 9,117,500 ST @ 0.326 oz Au/ST 
(containing 2,968,400 oz Au).  This resource estimate 
excludes the potential for large, bulk tonnage targets 
identified by EMGOLD in 1997.  


Upside Potential:  3,000,000+ oz Au

Located within the wedge-shaped confines of three 
bounding faults, a 3-D geologic model developed for 
the Idaho-Maryland mine demonstrates the potential 
for continuity of the existing vein system to a 
vertical depth of 5,000 feet (the Idaho-Maryland 
mine is essentially unexplored below a depth of 3,280 feet).

What is not widely known is that the adjoining Empire 
mine produced six million ounces of gold to a depth of 
5,200 feet!  This fact, combined with the knowledge that 
all mineralized structures developed on the lowest levels 
of the Idaho-Maryland mine remain open at depth, supports 
EMGOLD's belief that considerably more ore may exist at depth.


Development Program (1998 - 1999)

EMGOLD's plans for reviving the Idaho-Maryland mine are to 
first de-water the mine, and then go underground to do further 
exploration to prove up the total resource potential.   
EMGOLD has applied for and been granted all permits necessary 
for re-opening the New Brunswick shaft, de-watering the mine 
and completing a bankable feasibility.


Potential Gold Production of at Least 140,000 oz / 
yr @ US$215 / oz Au EMGOLD plans to resume operations at 
the Idaho-Maryland mine at an initial mining rate of 
1,500 ST ore / day, which would produce approximately 
140,000 ounces of gold per year.  With the addition of 
a second shaft, it may be possible to increase production 
to 5,000 ST/day - at this production level, the Idaho-Maryland 
mine would produce over 200,000 ounces of gold per year 
(on par with other major mines).

Recent studies indicate that the Idaho-Maryland mine could 
be profitably developed and operated at a long-term gold 
price of US$300/oz based on an estimated operating cost 
(excluding capital and royalties) of US$215 per ounce.  


Current Market Conditions

The current gold rally is gaining strength with each 
passing day!

In the past month, bullion prices have risen nearly 10%.  
Yesterday, the Philadelphia XAU gold and silver index 
closed at 74.69, up 53% from its record low of 48.67 
set in late August.
Mining stocks have regained favor with major Wall 
Street firms:  Merrill Lynch has initiated coverage of 
Placer Dome, Barrick, TVX and Kinross, while Bear Stearns 
has upgraded the recommendations of Asarco, Cyprus Amax 
and Phelps Dodge.

To a large extent, the market rebound has largely 
benefited the major mining companies, whose share 
prices are now fully-valued (or even
over-valued) at current gold prices.  However, we 
believe that, as the current rally continues, investors 
will increasingly seek out undervalued junior exploration 
and development companies with multi-million ounce gold deposits.


Opportunity for Investors

Trading at a tremendous discount to its fair market value, 
EMGOLD offers investors a low-risk investment opportunity 
in the current market environment, and a chance to accumulate 
a significant position in a stock that can be expected to 
rally strongly as gold prices move above US$300 / oz. 

With just 11.5 million shares outstanding (14 million 
fully-diluted) 
and a current share price of Cdn$0.28, the equity markets are 
valuing the Idaho-Maryland gold mine at just Cdn$1.06 per 
ounce of gold (Cdn$1.35 / oz Au on a fully-diluted basis).  


EMGOLD's  Idaho-Maryland mine offers one of the best advanced 
exploration / developmental prospects available in North America. 
 
With inferred resources of almost three million ounces, 
nearly one hundred years of operating history, an existing 
3,400-foot, three-compartment  shaft and 70+ miles of 
underground workings, EMGOLD has 100% control of a world-class 
gold project with the vast majority of the expensive 
infrastructure in place and ready to go.
