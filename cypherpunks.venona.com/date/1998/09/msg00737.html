Every time one of these AOL wars start, the AOLers claim that there are a
few intelligent people on AOL and that our shunning of them based on
statistics is unjustified. We all know what the statistics are, but I
don't think anybody has done this for Cypherpunks yet. It has been done
other places. This isn't scientific with margins of error and everything,
but it's good enough to illustrate the point.

I went through every posting originating from AOL which was sent to
Cypherpunks between July and September 16th, which is today. I classified
postings as either "clueful" or "clueless," with the latter determined by
relevance to the list, literacy, quoting, and whether it makes any sense
at all. Anything completely stupid is also classed as "clueless."
"Clueful" is anything which is even remotely relevant to the list, and
includes quoted material if a followup. 

In addition, if an AOL user sends something clueless to the list then gets
flamed, that posting and any subsequent postings in that thread by the
original author are counted as clueless unless it's an apology, at which
point it isn't counted at all. The flames of said user are counted as
defense, not as clueless. Also, if I looked at the message but couldn't
tell what the hell the author was talking about because he didn't bother
to quote, I classed the posting as clueless. 

A "*" denotes that the portion I quote is the entire message. A "+" 
denotes that there was either no quoted material in the message or that it
used the "&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;" style. Keep in mind that messages which are original would
not have quoted material, but still have a "+". A "H" means that it
contained HTML. I removed all new lines from the quotes to make them more
compact. If the posting was large, I quoted only some parts. 

Clueless posts from AOL:

    Nilsphone@aol.com, 23 Jul 1998, (), copied to 32 recipients, including

Note the "+" ratings on the below. (Semi-)Clueful postings from AOL:

1) "It's the easy way out (and I mean DOWN and OUT)!  I mean, if we're
   simply going to change them out everytime, why bother to figure out
   which ones a going to change them out everytime, why bother to figure
   out which ones aren't evil/stupid (I mean, out of all those
   politicians, there's got to be 1 or 2! I think. ;-) )? See, if we just
   simply change politicians at every chance, then we throw the baby out
   with the bathwater, so to speak.  The simple solutions aren't always
   the best ones." -- StanSqncrs@aol.com, 17 Jul 1998, (+*)

2) "ROFLOL!  What's coincidental?  The latest tune that my band, Nobody's

I gave up at this point because the clueless list just kept growing. The
ratio isn't encouraging, especially since I was being generous with what
is considered a "clueful post."
