&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, if you quote back over a hundred lines after adding 6, 8, or
&gt; whatever it happened to be.
&gt; 
Comment on this comes later.

&gt; &gt; &gt; About a week ago somebody posted a copy or parts of most AOL
&gt; &gt; &gt; postings which were sent here in the last months. Merrill ignores the part
&gt; &gt; &gt; about how the posts were classified
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I read his classification criteria closely, and read the results of the
&gt; &gt; classification process.
&gt; &gt; &gt; and sends back some vague flame accusing
&gt; &gt; &gt; the author of classing posts he disagreed with as "clueless" then he quotes
&gt; &gt; &gt; the entire thing back to the list.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then commented that he had not followed his own criteria.
&gt; 
&gt; And where did he not? A few could be debated. The rest were either written
&gt; so badly that they were incomprehensible, were off-topic, or didn't
&gt; include quoted material in a reply/followup. He also stated that he was
&gt; counting postings which used that '&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;' scheme as automatically bad,
&gt; which is understandable. Either way, he seemed to be trying to show the
&gt; statistics. Pull one or two postings off of one side and put them on the
&gt; other and the statistics are still pretty bad for AOL.
&gt;
1.  There are lies, damn lies, and statistics. 
2.  So if the quoted material is included it's bad and if it is not
included it's bad. I think I see the general idea.  Use the rules
appropriate for complaining about whoever you want to complain about.
3.  And what I said was along the lines of most were justified, but some
showed his lack of clues.  Merely being incomprehensible to a person
means little if the person is a little clue-shy.  Badly written is a bad
thing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know which is worse. At least the people flaming the AOL wimps are
&gt; &gt; &gt; funny.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If funny is all you want, may I recommend rec.humor.funny and, in case
&gt; &gt; you are up on no current events but Clinton, rec.humor.funny.reruns.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I want a Cypherpunks list which discusses political issues,
&gt; cryptography, and things related to that. Since this is the Cypherpunks
&gt; list, we aren't going to censor on the basis of content or origin point.
&gt;
And the general degradation of our society to the level that taking the
moral ground is something to be ridiculed is not a political issue?
 
&gt; If all you want to do is defend AOL and their ilk, may I recommend
&gt; comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy and alt.aol-sucks.
&gt; 
I'll pass, thanks anyway.

&gt; &gt; And to the brilliant person seeking muff diving pics, gee send a real
&gt; &gt; address and we'll see what we can do.  (At least he didn't want it for
&gt; &gt; pre-muff variety.)
&gt; 
&gt; Muff diving pics? Do we want to know? Serious questions.

That comment was in reference to two private (and anonymous)posts
purporting to be AOL weenies seeking such things.
