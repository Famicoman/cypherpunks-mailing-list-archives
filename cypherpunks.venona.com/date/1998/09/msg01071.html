&gt;&gt;       father:	  so... you "deny" God's existence since their is no
&gt;&gt;       		  "proof" of His existence. did you ever consider
&gt;&gt;that in
&gt;&gt;       		  order to "deny" anything, you must have defined that
&gt;&gt;       		  concept?  in other words, to deny God, you must have
&gt;&gt;       		  determined that I or someone else has defined God in
&gt;&gt;       		  order for you to be able to "deny" God?
&gt;
&gt;So, what has the issue of defining something got to do with its existance?
&gt;Is this bozo really claiming that God can only exist unless somebody thinks
&gt;him up? Sounds like religous hubris to me...
&gt;God was shinning on this asshole that he never had to argue face to face
&gt;with me at that age...

	Basically he is saying you can't deny the existence of something if
you don't know what it is.

	God is a label on a definition. Change the definition, and you
could conceivably change wheter "God" falls into the "Exists", "Doesn't
Exist", or
"I donno" state.

&gt;&gt;       counselor:  is there a difference between belief and faith?
&gt;The spelling.

&gt;&gt;       father:	  aethism is a concept which is almost impossible to
&gt;&gt;       		  define as it is a denial that if it could it doesnt.
&gt;&gt;       		  it is much easier to defend "agnosticism" where you
&gt;&gt;       		  admit you do not believe, or have faith, because you
&gt;&gt;       		  lack sufficient scientific proof. aethism is not
&gt;&gt;      		  doubting, it is denying, even in the face of proof.
&gt;Agnosticism has *nothing* to do with scientific proof. It existed eons
&gt;before anyone even thought of the scientific method. Skepticism is a part of
&gt;human nature, not philosophy, beliefs, or science.
&gt;Atheism is saying that while God could exist he doesn't. In other words it
&gt;is the belief that God doesn't exist and can't be proven contrary. There is
&gt;a fundamental belief that all proofs are flawed.

	There are some atheists who would argue that in this universe, God
(capital G, the Creator, Omni*, all good, Long white beard &amp; sandals, god
of ...) could NOT exist.

&gt;Agnosticism is the inability to believe one way or the other. It could be

	Or simply indecesion.

&gt;&gt; 		  suppose you die, and despite your lack of belief or
&gt;&gt; 		  faith, you find yourself before the throne of God.
&gt;My own personal suspicion is he's going to ask you whether you lived your
&gt;beliefs even in the face of overwhelming opposition. As long as you say
&gt;"Yes" he's going to be a happy camper.
&gt;To borrow a Christian icon, he's going to want to know if you worshiped
&gt;false idols.

	He? Talk about hubris...

	Personally, I'm not an atheist any more, I'm a apathist. I don't
care whether God exists, or even what his characteristics are. I care how
whether each and every individual that affects my life acts responsibly and
fairly. Other than that, I could give a shit.
