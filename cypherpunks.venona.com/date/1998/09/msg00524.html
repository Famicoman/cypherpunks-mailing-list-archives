&gt;I don't see a power imbalance here.  If a young woman in her 20's
&gt;invitingly flashes her thong panties at a man, I don't see how she can be
&gt;portrayed as the victim.  The only way that the issue of power arises is
&gt;that Monica was not overwhelmed by someone in power - she was attracted to
&gt;the power.
&gt;
    I suspect _you_ can handle the power imbalance. Monica is not exactly
    what I would call a collected, stable example of the female species.

    she was scrambled from her parents divorce, was anxious to be both
    liked and approved, and she told the high school teacher she had
    been babysitter for _and_ rolling (sounds like a Kennedy doesn't it)
    that she was in Washington earning her "knee pads" with Clinton.  

    now, that's an unstable freak who is attracted to father figures 
    (Electra complex, if you will) and absolute power over her.

    I dont think as a woman you can understand the fear a male boss
    feels; even if there is a genuine love interest, you crap in your
    own hat, it will be served up to you some day. or as it is sometimes
    stated: "...dont get your meat where you earn your bread...."

    it doesnt matter whether Monica hiked her dress, or Clinton dropped
    his trou (which is more likely given his track record)

    even if Monica was "a willing, consenting adult", any man in a
    position of power who takes advantage of a star-struck female
    30 years his junior is guilty of an abuse of power (personal) and
    in this case using the position of "The President of the United
    States" as his instrument of power --end of story.
    
    to be a "consensual act", the woman certainly needs to not be
    an emotional disaster --and not be preyed upon by a raging
    psychopath who has no more common sense than a drunken fraternity
    brat who says: "Hi, my name is Bill Clinton, let's fuck!"

&gt;On another but connected note, explain why Monica saved that dress!  I
&gt;found this little tidbit to be the "yuck" factor...
&gt;
    she's sick...  simple as that. apparently she was not exactly
    monogamous; 

    probably saved used prophylactics from the rest of them. 
&gt;
&gt;
    note one of her last snivels to Clinton was that she wanted 
    to do the "horizontal bop" --just once. 

    the whole thing is sick.

    stupid Americans only vote with their wallet.

    the American bread and circus mentality does not care... 

    if the economy had already fallen, they would howl Clinton out of
    office faster than a school principal accused by some mother who 
    misunderstood her 5 year old.

    however, leave the scurrilous bag of camel dung in office; the
    government bogged down and consumed with its own evil is a 
    government which is too preoccupied to maximize the damage they
    are doing to the country and the world. maybe they will leave
    us alone.

    like I said before: leave Clinton alone --Al Bore is worse; and,
    I'll even put up with the bitch over Tipper.
