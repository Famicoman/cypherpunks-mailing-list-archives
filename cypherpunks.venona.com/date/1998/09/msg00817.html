Actually, 

there seems to be a screw up out  there.

Right now, one can go down the 7/11, and pay 
cash for a prepaid cellphone, and renew it with 
cellphone time cards also purchased with cash.

No paperwork, NONE.

I have one.

While all of the technology applies, and certainly it is possible
to determine things by analyzing calling habits, I can't see how one
can easily determine who has cellphone #blahblahblahblahblah when 
you just bought a box at an out of town 7/11 during the breakfast
rush with cash.

Esp if one doesn't make a lot of calls.

&gt; &gt; Regarding the tracking of mobile phones, are all current types of phones
&gt; &gt; susceptible?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There was a recent post here regarding tracking of GSM phones.
&gt; &gt; TDMA/CDMA, analog/digital, PCS-band, etc, are they all equally capable
&gt; &gt; of being tracked?
&gt; 
&gt; 	All the wireless standards I am aware of allow for registration
&gt; and polling phones to find out if they are on and available without
&gt; ringing them. This provides silent location information to the nearest
&gt; cell of a phone merely turned on, location  which may be hundreds of
&gt; feet in tightly congested urban areas and tens of square miles in
&gt; suburban and less populated areas.   Some system operators apparently
&gt; use this feature with all active phones to relieve congestion on paging
&gt; channels, while others do not actively track phones not being used
&gt; except in certain situations or parts of the network.   Of course
&gt; location to a cell is always available during a call...
&gt; 
&gt; 	The FCC has mandated that this cell-granularity location
&gt; information be made available to E-911 centers on emergency calls, and
&gt; there may be some situations in which it is currently made available to
&gt; domestic law enforcement under other circumstances, though CALEA
&gt; restricts such availability without warrents.  Whether and under what
&gt; circumstances law enforcement can request a poll be transmitted
&gt; (re-registration) to locate a silent but powered phone is less clear.  
&gt; It would seem that CALEA forbids this, but what in fact is the practice
&gt; by such agencies as the FBI working quietly with cell carriers in places
&gt; such as NYC is less clear.
&gt; 
&gt; 	In the future FCC rules will require that all E-911 calling
&gt; wireless phones be located to 125 meters 67% of the time.  There are
&gt; proposals to do this with differential time of arrival (DTOA)
&gt; or other direction finding techniques (apparently a hard problem
&gt; in cities with lots of multipath propagation due to reflections)
&gt; that work passively on some or all cell calls and registrations
&gt; (thus allowing tracking of everybody), or by cooperation with the
&gt; cellphone handset that could be only turned on when the user wished
&gt; to be located (an E-911 emergency) and disabled otherwise.   One
&gt; version of this would use GPS rather than ranging or other techniques
&gt; to determine position relative to the cell sites.    Of course all
&gt; the user disaablable  techniques such as GPS and DTOA done in the handset
&gt; firmware only will work with future cell firmware and hardware
&gt; and not legacy handsets, and because of this may not be acceptable
&gt; to the FCC.
&gt; 
&gt; 	There are some distinctions between CDMA, GSM, analog and TDMA
&gt; (non GSM), in respects to exactly how easy it is to implement precision
&gt; location meeting the FCC spec passively and on all calls at all times.
&gt; Apparently CDMA with its very tight power control to minimize the near-far
&gt; problem makes it fairly awkward to reliably triangulate position from
&gt; multiple sites since the mobile may be only detectable at one site
&gt; at any time...  What this means in practice is that some wireless
&gt; technologies are more likely to require some definate active firmware
&gt; intervention to do precision location, whilst others may allow it
&gt; with no special intervention.   If the FCC allows this intervention
&gt; to be enabled by a user, this may provide some opportunity for
&gt; location privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However pagers are not, correct? They just broadcast an entire area to
&gt; &gt; page instead of the pager keeping the network informed of their
&gt; &gt; location.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The one way pagers work this way.  The guaranteed delivery two
&gt; way pagers do support registration and will know the location of
&gt; the pager after a page has been sent to it and any time the system
&gt; wants to determine it.   This location will be quite coarse with current
&gt; two way (reFlex) pagers with cell sites some distance apart, but 
&gt; DF techniques are quite possible and could be implemented by law
&gt; enforcement or spooks or other interested groups.  Unlike wireless phones
&gt; there is no current FCC requirement for positioning information distribution
&gt; or precision positioning infrastructure, so two way pagers aren't
&gt; likeyly to be routinely located accurately any time soon.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Of course most modern wireless phones support paging message
&gt; delivery, so more and more people will be using wireless phones with
&gt; the FCC mandated tracking accuracy for paging...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One thing I have long wondered: Why don't they make phones that
&gt; &gt; "wake-up" by a paging signal and then accept the call? It might increase
&gt; &gt; the connect time significantly, but it would also increase the potential
&gt; &gt; stand-by time indefinitely, and the location of the user is only exposed
&gt; &gt; when calls are in progress, not while the phone is on stand-by.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 	Wireless phones do currently work this way.  They listen to the
&gt; forward control channel for a paging message that says they have got a
&gt; call coming in and only then do they transmit.  The amount of power used
&gt; in transmitting would quickly use up the battery if they continuously
&gt; broadcast.  The problem with cellphone location is that they can also be
&gt; paged with a registration request that does not cause them to ring
&gt; or show any evidence of transmitting, but sends back a brief message
&gt; burst (not using much battery).   This can be made to happen every
&gt; so often, or only when polled.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are there any paging services (particularly alpha paging) that work on a
&gt; &gt; global scale? You would think daily pager rental service (esp. at
&gt; &gt; airports) would be popular. You could have an email address, even a
&gt; &gt; static phone number, that could re-route messages to any pager that you
&gt; &gt; happen to have at the time (PSTN-IP-PSTN, or even easier if the pager
&gt; &gt; service gives SMTP addresses, which most do these days).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 	There are nationwide pager services that broadcast your pages
&gt; over very wide areas or depend on registration to locate you down to
&gt; a smaller area.  But yes, you can get paged anywhere in the US and
&gt; several other countries.  And the new LEO satellite technology will
&gt; allow paging over whole continents or potentially anywhere in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Similarly a PSTN-IP-PSTN interface for voice could give you a static
&gt; &gt; phone number that you could dynamically forward anywhere untraceably.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The LEAs don't like this concept, and one of the provisions of
&gt; the CALEA wiretap stuff is providing tracing of calls forwarded so you can't
&gt; do this....
