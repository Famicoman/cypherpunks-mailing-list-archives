I hate to break it to you but, while most are pretty damn clueless,
there were some in that list that show that either you should go find a
clue (because the thought expressed went right over your head) or you
are placing all things which you disagree with in the clueless category.

&gt; Every time one of these AOL wars start, the AOLers claim that there are a
&gt; few intelligent people on AOL and that our shunning of them based on
&gt; statistics is unjustified. We all know what the statistics are, but I
&gt; don't think anybody has done this for Cypherpunks yet. It has been done
&gt; other places. This isn't scientific with margins of error and everything,
&gt; but it's good enough to illustrate the point.
&gt; 
&gt; I went through every posting originating from AOL which was sent to
&gt; Cypherpunks between July and September 16th, which is today. I classified
&gt; postings as either "clueful" or "clueless," with the latter determined by
&gt; relevance to the list, literacy, quoting, and whether it makes any sense
&gt; at all. Anything completely stupid is also classed as "clueless."
&gt; "Clueful" is anything which is even remotely relevant to the list, and
&gt; includes quoted material if a followup.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, if an AOL user sends something clueless to the list then gets
&gt; flamed, that posting and any subsequent postings in that thread by the
&gt; original author are counted as clueless unless it's an apology, at which
&gt; point it isn't counted at all. The flames of said user are counted as
&gt; defense, not as clueless. Also, if I looked at the message but couldn't
&gt; tell what the hell the author was talking about because he didn't bother
&gt; to quote, I classed the posting as clueless.
&gt; 
&gt; A "*" denotes that the portion I quote is the entire message. A "+"
&gt; denotes that there was either no quoted material in the message or that it
&gt; used the "&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;" style. Keep in mind that messages which are original would
&gt; not have quoted material, but still have a "+". A "H" means that it
&gt; contained HTML. I removed all new lines from the quotes to make them more
&gt; compact. If the posting was large, I quoted only some parts.
&gt; 
&gt; Clueless posts from AOL:
&gt;

&gt; is considered a "clueful post."
