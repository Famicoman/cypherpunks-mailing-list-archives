Hi. You've been sponsored as "Significant Other" by Joe Cypherpunk 
as part of something called sixdegrees, one of the fastest growing 
phenomena on the Web, located at <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com">http://www.sixdegrees.com</A>

You may have already heard of the six degrees of separation concept 
- where everyone on the planet is connected to each other through 
fewer than 6 people. Well, we haven't quite connected the whole 
world yet, but there are over a million people participating, and 
over 900,000 of them are connected in one giant chain. 

And, just by confirming your relationship with Joe, you can 
instantly tap into this interconnected community of interesting people 
from all over the world.

So what? Well, by getting connected, you can come to the Web site 
(which is completely FREE) and use a whole variety of valuable, fun 
and intriguing services that make use of this massive chain of 
connections.

You can come see who's logged on the site right now and when you 
find someone interesting, we'll show you exactly how you're 
connected no matter how many degrees it takes, and then you can 
instant message them. 

You can also find out how you're connected to that head of personnel 
at the big firm where you've been trying to get your foot in the 
door. 

You can chat with people from around the globe and then see who you
know in common. 

You can post burning questions on your own personalized bulletin 
board and get valuable answers from your "circle" (your friends 
and friends of friends). 

You can even get Movie recommendations from the people you're 
connected to.

So, stop by the site at <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com">http://www.sixdegrees.com</A> to learn more and 
give it a try. (You can log in with this password: listhome). 

====================================================================

You can also get things started and get yourself connected right 
from this e-mail: 

** To confirm your relationship with Joe, just send a reply 
   that says only CONFIRM on the first line of the message body

*  To deny this particular relationship (but keep open the
   possibility of joining sixdegrees if the concept intrigues you) 
   send a reply that says only DENY

*  And, if you'd like to make sure you don't hear from us again 
   (even if somebody else you know lists you as a contact) then 
   simply send a reply which says REMOVE in the SUBJECT LINE so 
   we can process your request right away

Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you at sixdegrees.

====================================================================

And, if you're really ambitious, you can get your network of 
connections growing right away. Just list the people you think might 
be interested in participating in sixdegrees and we'll contact them 
with an e-mail like this one which mentions your name and invites 
them to join.

Just follow these directions:

*  Click your mail program's REPLY button. 

*  On the FIRST line of the message body of the reply e-mail that 
   opens, type only the word CONFIRM to let us know that you 
   are in fact Joe's Significant Other.

*  On the next line of the message body list the first and last 
   names and e-mail addresses of the people you'd like to invite
   (you can list as many as you'd like - but we recommend you list 
   at least two), and the relationship numbers that correspond 
   with how those people are related to you. 

MAKE SURE:  

*  That the first name, last name, e-mail address and relationship 
   number are separated by SEMI-COLONS. 

*  You follow the format of these examples:

     John; Smith; jsmith@fakeplace.com; 12
     Jane; Doe; superjane@fakeplace.com; 3

*  And that you define each relationship by choosing a number from 
   this list:

 1=wife              2=husband              3=life partner
 4=significant other 5=mother               6=father
 7=sister            8=brother              9=daughter
10=son              11=other family member 12=friend
13=employer         14=employee            15=co-worker
16=client           17=service provider    18=business contact
19=fellow alum      20=acquaintance 


We look forward to hearing from you!
