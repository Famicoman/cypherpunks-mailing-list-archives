Dear Supporters of Community Media and Free Speech,

You may be aware that the Federal Communications Commission
has recently intensified it's assault on unlicensed micropower
radio stations.  In response to this campaign and the government's
longstanding ban on low-power radio, a national movement has emerged
to proliferate microbroadcasting, and win constitutional protection to
broadcast at the community level.

We invite you to  show your support for
community access to the airwaves. Join us in Washington, DC
on Sunday, October 4  for a micropower radio conference,
and on Monday October 5 for a march on FCC and  NAB headquarters.

Workshops &amp; information will be offered on how to start a radio
station and acquire the necessary equipment.

Please pass this on to people who might be interested, especially
those who don't have access to the internet.

See you in Washington.

Thanks,

Greg Ruggiero
New York Free Media Alliance

SHOWDOWN AT THE FCC!

 FREE RADIO ACTIVISTS MARCH ON WASHINGTON TO
 CONFRONT THE GLOBAL  MEDIA MONOPOLY AND
THEIR MARIONETTES IN GOVERNMENT!

Sunday, October 4, 1998
Monday, October 5, 1998
Washington, DC

Calling all media activists, microbroadcasters and people for a
democratic media:

 Come to DC for the first national mobilization for free radio.
 Microbroadcasters from around the country will gather for
 two days to share radio skills, organize alliances, speak out
 to the media and protest at the FCC and NAB buildings,
 culminating in a live broadcast straight into the offices of the
people working so hard to shut us down. Free Radio Berkeley, Radio
Mutiny, Steal This Radio and other microstations have all broadcast
live in public and challenged the FCC to shut them down in the light
of day, in front of the press and the Feds have never dared to show
their face- this time, we're going to take it right to their doorstep
and tell them that if they're so sure that their dumb law is worth
enforcing, then the Chairman should come down from the 8th floor and
put the cuffs on us himself.

There will also be workshops to help new folks start
stations, appointments will be made to lobby congress
people, and press events will be held to show the true,
diverse face of the microbroadcasting movement.

Schedule

                       Sunday,
                       10-12 workshops (to be announced)
                       12-1 lunch
                       1-3 workshops (to be announced)
                       3-5 speakout
                       5-6:30 dinner
                       7pm party/puppet making for demonstration
  Monday

 10:30 am MARCH AND PUPPET PARADE
  starts at Dupont Circle, goes to the Federal
 Communications Commission building, and then marches
on to confront the National Association of Broadcasters.
During these protests, we will flip the giant free speech
switches, turn on our transmitters and strike a blow against
the meta-marionettes: A giant puppet of General Electric
and Corporate America, which will in turn control a slightly
smaller puppet of the National Association of Broadcasters,
which in turn will operate a smaller puppet of the FCC,
which in turn will be trying to stamp out microbroadcasters
and our free speech rights. These demonstrations will also
include a number of sneaky surprises that are so cool that
we can't even mention them here!

1:30pm

meetings set up with people's congressional
representatives for lobbying

4pm press event:

What Can a Black Panther, a Free Market Think Tank
Policy Analyst, an Anarchist Feminist,   A Radio Engineer,
A Public Health Worker and a Discount
Store Owner Agree Upon? IT'S TIME TO LEGALIZE
MICROBROADCASTING!

 So what's YOUR excuse not to come to the most
excellent weekend of mayhem ever? Nothing. Then good-
we'll see you there.

Bring a sleeping bag, cameras and recording devices,
vehicles, some money to help this all come off, questions
for the experts on pirate station operations, puppet
materials, signs and banners, transmitters, AND ALL OF
YOUR FRIENDS!
