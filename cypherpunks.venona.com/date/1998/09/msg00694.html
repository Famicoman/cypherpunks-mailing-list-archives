&gt;&gt; (I was not sure which email address to send this to, as the return
&gt;&gt; address was:  nobody@replay.com.  I also do not know who to address this
&gt;&gt; email to.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am the WHOIS contact at sixdegrees you sent this email to, and since
&gt;&gt; this is a peronal reply to your email, it is certainly NOT spam and I
&gt;&gt; would appreciate it if you would take the time to read it and respond.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am very confused by your email.  I understand that you do not wish to
&gt;&gt; receive emails from sixdegrees, but it is very easy to solve this
&gt;&gt; problem.  If anyone ever sponsors you for sixdegrees, simply reply to
&gt;&gt; the email and put the word "remove" in the header.  (This is pretty
&gt;&gt; standard stuff across the Internet, as I am sure you are aware.)  If
&gt;&gt; that occurs, in the future we will not send emails to the email address
&gt;&gt; that received the original email from us.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, if you have many email addresses (as it appears, from the
&gt;&gt; bottom of your email), the only way for us to remove each is to have a
&gt;&gt; sixdegrees email go to each of these email address accounts and then
&gt;&gt; received a "remove" reply to each of these emails.  (We have in our
&gt;&gt; records references to 5 different cypherpunks email addresses: 
&gt;&gt; @toad.com, @cypherpunks.net, @cypherpunks.org, @algebra.com, and
&gt;&gt; @ssz.com.  If you wish for us not to contact you again at any of these
&gt;&gt; addresses, we will need to confirm that you in fact control these email
&gt;&gt; addresses.  The best way for you to do this is to send an email to
&gt;&gt; cancel@sixdegrees.com, and ask to have these email addresses removed. 
&gt;&gt; We will then send a reply to each email address you listed, asking you
&gt;&gt; to confirm that you in fact control those email addresses and wish to
&gt;&gt; have them removed.  Once we receive your confirmation, we will adjust
&gt;&gt; our records so you receive no further emails from us to those email
&gt;&gt; addresses.  For example, if I receive an email from you to this email, I
&gt;&gt; will assume that you control the @toad.com email address and I will have
&gt;&gt; that removed.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What is confusing to me is that the email you received from sixdegrees
&gt;&gt; (with the subject:  Harald Fragner) is one that would be sent ONLY to a
&gt;&gt; CONFIRMED sixdegrees user.  That means that once upon a time, whether
&gt;&gt; you remember or not, you joined sixdegrees (as have over 1,000,000
&gt;&gt; people to date).  It also appears that you listed Harald Fragner as a
&gt;&gt; contact, and he recently denied his sixdegrees relationship with you. 
&gt;&gt; Thus, it is not surprising that you would receive emails from
&gt;&gt; sixdegrees, as you had registered for our service at one time.  (I
&gt;&gt; assume that the email address you used to register with sixdegrees was
&gt;&gt; the @toad.com one.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; sixdegrees is purely a voluntary service, and if you do not want to
&gt;&gt; participate in it, then we are happy to accommodate you.  We do not send
&gt;&gt; out spam and take great efforts to ensure that no one receives unwanted
&gt;&gt; email from us.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I look forward to receiving your reply to this email.

&gt;&gt; &gt; On Tue, 15 Sep 1998, the shitheads at sixdegrees spammed the Cypherpunks
&gt;&gt; &gt; list with:
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a quick update from sixdegrees(tm). Unfortunately Harald
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fragner (harald@fragner.net) asked not to be listed as your
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; contact with sixdegrees.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We also wanted to make sure you were aware that you currently
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have no other confirmed contacts, so it will be hard for you to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have a productive sixdegrees experience. As you probably know,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; without any confirmed contacts, you won't get any results from our
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; networking searches.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So, we just wanted to recommend that you head over to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.sixdegrees.com">http://www.sixdegrees.com</A> , log-in, and go to MY CONTACTS
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to list additional relationships.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; PLEASE NOTE: All replies to this address are processed by a computer.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have any problems, questions or requests send an e-mail to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; issues@sixdegrees.com and someone will get back to you as soon as
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Just a quick update from the Cypherpunks(tm). Fortunately, we don't want
&gt;&gt; &gt; anything to do with your worthless, pathetic, spamming selves. We don't
&gt;&gt; &gt; want to be your friends and, in fact, we'd prefer it if you would crawl
&gt;&gt; &gt; under a rock and die because that seems to be the only way you'll stop
&gt;&gt; &gt; spamming our mailing list.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; We also wanted to make sure that you were aware that you currently
have no
&gt;&gt; &gt; confirmed redeeming qualities, so it will be hard for you to be taken
&gt;&gt; &gt; seriously by those of us who do have a clue. As you probably know,
without
&gt;&gt; &gt; any redeeming qualities, you will get lots of results every time you send
&gt;&gt; &gt; out a batch of spam.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; So, we just wanted to recommend that you head on over to your bathtub
with
&gt;&gt; &gt; the rest of your coworkers, fill it up, jump in together, and then
drop in
&gt;&gt; &gt; a large, plugged-in, turned-on electric heater into the water and remain
&gt;&gt; &gt; in until you stop twitching and cardiac activity ceases.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You people don't give a fuck how much excrement you shoot all over the
&gt;&gt; &gt; net, so long as you let people know of your pathetic, worthless,
&gt;&gt; &gt; disgusting service. If you can get somebody's mailing list to relay your
&gt;&gt; &gt; shit for you, so much the better, because then you don't have to
&gt;&gt; &gt; personally send it.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry, but I've had it with Sixdegrees. I've personally told you idiots
&gt;&gt; &gt; very nicely what the Cypherpunks list is, and asked you nicely to stop
&gt;&gt; &gt; spamming it. I've personally told you a method to keep people from
&gt;&gt; &gt; submitting these addresses to your worthless spam haven. Other people
have
&gt;&gt; &gt; done the same thing. You haven't fixed it, indicating that you don't
care.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm no longer asking nicely.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; A copy is being sent to your technical contact, on the assumption that
&gt;&gt; &gt; maybe he is a little more responsible, though I doubt it.
