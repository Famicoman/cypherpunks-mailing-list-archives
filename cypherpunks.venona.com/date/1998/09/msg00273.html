As i'am one of persons mention in Toto's posts I would just like to 
say I think the posts were a joke.
With the help of of Vullis I was a pain to the list and this was Toto's 
way of acknowledging this
To the government readers of this list,the cigar was Cuban,will you 
put Bill in the cell with Toto.

&gt; 
&gt; It was a pleasure to reread Toto(s)'s stuff while searching the 
&gt; cpunk amazing archives -- what a waterfall from everyone of free 
&gt; association, tants, jibes, potshots and richochets and self-mockery. 
&gt; I now believe the report from TX that Carl's got an IQ off the charts
&gt; like all cpunks off the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; It's worth keeping in mind that multiple users of pseudonyms is
&gt; not unusual, at least among artists long before the Internet, and 
&gt; not only performance group e-mailers like the Totos, CJ Parkers, 
&gt; XxxMongers, Gus-Peters and endless Anonymees jostling for
&gt; unrecognition.
&gt; 
&gt; Two venerable and heavily-used nyms in Europe are Luther Bissett 
&gt; and Monty Cantsin. A dazzling Monty Cantsin posted here for a 
&gt; while. A Luther Bissett message ridiculing the recent kiddie porn
&gt; sweep was posted to Cyberia a few days ago. But these pseudonyms 
&gt; and others are frequently used to taunt uptight authoritarians by 
&gt; substantial numbers of people, sometimes acting in concert but 
&gt; most often acting alone.
&gt; 
&gt; An exemplary case of acting up like the Totos and other performance
&gt; pseudo-Feynmann's here, is that of Dario Fo, the Italian artist who 
&gt; recently won the Nobel Prize. His off the chart genius, too, was in 
&gt; mixing the real and imaginary to challenge, and to frighten, authority 
&gt; into revealing their treacherous deception of the real and imaginary 
&gt; to maintain state and religious control century after century, culture
&gt; after culture. He, too, was regularly condemned by those obsesses
&gt; with holding onto power, and sometimes arrested, for his imitations
&gt; of them at their most buffoonish and serious.
&gt; 
&gt; Fo is from an earlier generation, though, and what more agressively
&gt; offensive form is suitable for those younger we may be witnessing in 
&gt; the Jim Bells, Unknown Arrestees, and those here not yet projected 
&gt; onto the world stage but working the crowd most effectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Black Unicorn, step up to the mike. Show magic.
&gt; 
&gt; In any, case, I'm delighted to see Cypherpunks get credit in the Johnson
&gt; pseudo-complaint for hosting transgressive art appropriate for the age of 
&gt; widespreading disinformation. A tumultous trial to amplify this forum's 
&gt; mayhemic virtues and vices would be magnificently chaotic and hopefully 
&gt; anarchic to the max. 
&gt; 
&gt; Pray for CJ to get an equally mad attorney to demand his day, and our day, 
&gt; in court. This under-recognized witness is eager for a highly offensive 
&gt; part to play, a gibbering idiot like Toto(s), you bet, I admire their style of
&gt; spleen and threat to the fools of seriousness.
&gt;
