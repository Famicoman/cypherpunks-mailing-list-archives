The Board of Directors of El Misti Gold Limited is pleased to summarize 
current diamond drill results for its wholly owned Sinchao Project in 
northern Peru located some 450 km north of Lima and 30 km from the 
Yanacocha Mine, South America's largest gold producer. These results 
confirm the presence of a large copper-gold-zinc-silver system with 
potentially economic grades amenable to open pit mining. The deposit 
remains open laterally in all directions and there is potential for several 
hundred million tonnes of mineralization. The analytical results were 
provided by Intertek Testing Services (Bondar Clegg). The quality 
assurance for all aspects of the diamond drill program has been 
provided by Howe Chile Ltda., a subsidiary of ACA Howe Ltd.
Drill holes SDH-10, SDH-5, SDH-6 and SDH-7 have delineated 
mineralization over a length of 640 metres and a width of 300 
metres with an average thickness of 478 metres. Preliminary 
test work indicates a specific gravity of 2.6. These measurements 
indicate a potential for a mineralized zone of approximately 239 million
 tonnes at a grade of 1.45g/t gold equivalent (Cu equiv. 0.84%). 
This includes 163 million tonnes at a grade of 1.70 g/t gold equivalent 
(Cu equiv. 0.99%) which includes 111 million tonnes at a grade of 2.18 
g/t gold equivalent (Cu equiv. 1.27 %). The mineralization is polymetallic 
whose value is derived approximately 38% from copper, 24% from gold, 
23% from zinc and 15% silver. The accompanying map (not available in 
e-mail format, please check the Company's web site) shows the area of 
mineralization defined by the current diamond drill results.

Additional results for drill hole SDH-10 and previously released results 
are set out in Table 1 and are summarized below. Gold and copper equivalent 
grades have been calculated for each of the significant mineralized intercepts 
on the basis of in-ground values using the following metal prices: US $287/oz 
gold, US $5.55/oz silver, US $0.72/lb copper, and US $0.52/lb zinc.

Hole SDH 10: 490 (1,181 feet) metres of mineralized intercept at a gold 
equivalent grade of 1.61 g/t (Cu equiv. 0.94 %).
Hole SDH-5: 495 (1,636 feet) metres of mineralized intercept at a gold 
equivalent grade of 1.59 g/t (Cu equiv. 0.92 %).
Hole SDH-6: 602 (1,850 feet) metres of mineralized intercept at a gold 
equivalent grade of 1.22 g/t (Cu equiv. 0.71 %).
Hole SDH-7: 592 (1,810 feet) metres of mineralized intercept at a gold 
equivalent grade of 1.36 g/t (Cu equiv. 0.79 %).

At Sinchao, to date, the Company has undertaken geological mapping, 
geochemical sampling and ground geophysics followed by drilling. 
During 1997, twelve RC holes (1,768 metres) were drilled and during 
1998, seven RC holes (1,174.5 metres) and ten diamond drill holes 
(5,176.25 metres) were drilled.

The Board is highly encouraged with the mineralization and potential 
of the Sinchao project and has retained well known and highly respected 
independent geologist Lindsay R. Bottomer, P. Geo to review all Sinchao 
project data and help the Board formulate the appropriate next steps for 1999.
