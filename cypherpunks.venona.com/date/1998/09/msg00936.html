<BR>
Hi to all of you. I know most of you personally, except for the posts to <BR>
mailing lists and public organisms.<BR>
<BR>
- - ------------------ beginning of letter ---------------<BR>
Yesterday night, around 2am, I was unable to sleep and surfing the TV <BR>
channels up until I fell on a movie on the ShowCase channel. This channel <BR>
is devoted to repertoire cinema and less mainstream movies.<BR>
<BR>
As I flick to this channel, I see something I can't take my eyes off for <BR>
it's overwhelming revolting topic: a bunch of corpses are on a dolly, each <BR>
of one being tied by the feet to a crane cable and quickly, efficiently <BR>
taken away to a big heap of corpses.<BR>
&lt;SNIP&gt;<BR>
***************** End of Quote **************************<BR>
<BR>
I was in Rwanda during the latter part of the genocide and during the period<BR>
immediately following the Revolution. I concur with Mr. Avon. I have seen<BR>
the heaps of corpses. The deaths of these people is tragic and firearms<BR>
owners and free men and women should know what can happen if we allow<BR>
ourselves to be cowed by government.<BR>
<BR>
It is worthwhile noting that contrary to the lies spewed by anti firearms<BR>
groups firearms do not kill people. Rarely were the people of Rwanda killed<BR>
by gunfire. They were killed in the tens of thousands with clubs and<BR>
machetes. Why did these people go to there deaths like sheep to the<BR>
slaughter? In my opinion they were so accustomed to unquestioning compliance<BR>
that even in the face of death they would not rise up and fight. At the<BR>
dozens of execution sites I encountered there were only two occasions where<BR>
I saw evidence of gunfire. This was in the form of shotgun casings. I<BR>
point this out because I questioned survivors about the procedures used by<BR>
the government forces to round up and execute the mass numbers of people we<BR>
are talking about here.<BR>
<BR>
Consistently, I was told that the government forces, with the assistance of<BR>
collaborators, would either threaten the village leaders or convince them<BR>
that they would be spared if they complied. They then moved the group<BR>
en-mass to a collection point. At this time the villagers still complied<BR>
with the butchers. Once a sufficient number of people were collected they<BR>
would be slaughtered. The ratio of killers to victims would be quite small<BR>
so if they had risen up as a group there could have been mass escape. This<BR>
did not happen. There were exceptions . . . this is where the shotgun<BR>
shells come in. There would be a couple of government soldiers with guns to<BR>
cut down anyone that fled. <BR>
<BR>
In the Amahoro stadium in Kigali the bodies were piled one on top of<BR>
another. Approx. 25,000 Rwandans were slaughtered there over a period of<BR>
just a few days. In a small church and grounds on the road North from<BR>
Cyangugu another 10,000 where slaughtered, hacked and bludgeoned to death. <BR>
<BR>
Of all the sensory overloads I experienced, one of the most memorable was<BR>
that of a school in a village near the Eastern town of Byumba. The men and<BR>
women were separated, which was fairly common, and then slaughtered. As<BR>
usual they were not JUST killed but were hacked to pieces. Limbs were often<BR>
chopped off first, brutal torture and emasculation was common before a<BR>
merciful death was delivered by a fatal blow or machete wound. <BR>
<BR>
One of the dead was a young woman, her skull had been crushed with a club,<BR>
upon examination of the body I saw that she still clutched her infant child<BR>
to her chest. The skull of the child too was crushed. Drunk on the<BR>
absolute power given to them by the government the soldiers and Intehamwe<BR>
collaborators became blood thirsty fiends capable of killing a baby in such<BR>
a brutal manner. (there were worse things but this has imprinted on my<BR>
brain)<BR>
<BR>
In the center of the hollow square arrangement of huts were 2 twelve gauge<BR>
casings . . . someone had tried to escape!<BR>
<BR>
There may be those who don't feel this information is topical or appropriate<BR>
for the Digest as it is not directly a firearm issue. I believe there are<BR>
some lessons.<BR>
<BR>
1. Never have blind trust in the government when it comes to your or your<BR>
loved ones life(a la Hep C).<BR>
2. There will always be collaborators, help your neighbor but never trust<BR>
them completely.<BR>
3. Alone we are vulnerable, it is only through a unified group that you<BR>
stand a chance against oppression.<BR>
4. To find out what a man is, give him power.<BR>
5. To murder masses, the mass murder does not need a specific tool.<BR>
6. Police and soldiers should never be the only ones with guns.<BR>
<BR>
(My credo, re-enforced by my experiences), As a free man I will not die on<BR>
my knees.<BR>
<BR>
I submitted a quote to the list some months back. If the moderator will<BR>
indulge me I would like to submit it again.<BR>
<BR>
"War is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and<BR>
degraded state of moral and patriotic feelings which thinks that nothing is<BR>
worth war is much worse. A man who has nothing for which he is willing to<BR>
fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a<BR>
miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so<BR>
by the exertions of better men than himself." - John Stuart Mill<BR>
