Some months ago, the cops in Washington D.C. swept through the housing
projects, rounded up, and executed a large number of 'illegal dogs' (pit
bulls?). There was a tiny paragraph in USA Today about it. -hedges-

&gt;
&gt;LETTER TO BAN DOGS
&gt;
&gt;To the Editor
&gt;Arizona Republic
&gt;P.O. Box 2244
&gt;Phoenix, Arizona 85002
&gt;
&gt;January 7th, 1998
&gt;
&gt;Dear Editor,
&gt;
&gt;I am gratified to read in this morning's paper that someone has finally
&gt;called attention to an urgent situation which I have known about for a long
&gt;time:  annually 334,000 victims of savage dog bites, most frequently
&gt;children, average age 15, are taken to the nation's emergency rooms.  As
&gt;the article states: "That's more ER visits than injuries from skateboards,
&gt;baby walkers and in-line skates combined."  Total annual cost of ER dog
&gt;bites: $102.4 million.  Twenty or more people killed annually by dogs,
&gt;almost all of them children.
&gt;
&gt;Because these dogs are so readily obtainable on the streets of our nation,
&gt;I implore all your readers to immediately deluge their Congressmen with
&gt;letters, phone calls, faxes and telegrams to support the federal "Save the
&gt;Widdle Childwen Fwom the Vicious Dog-Bite Act of 1998", which would require
&gt;the following: mandatory muzzles fitted with muzzle-locks to be kept at all
&gt;times on all dogs, licensing and paw-printing of all dogs, fingerprinting
&gt;and house-monitoring of dog owners, including mandatory,
&gt;federally-monitored safe storage of dogs and an immediate 1,000% tax on all
&gt;dog food.  This Act is sponsored by Canine Control Incorporated, an
&gt;organization dedicated to eliminating canine violence in America by the
&gt;year 2000. The Act also provides for the immediate banning of all "assault
&gt;dogs", the definition of which term will constantly change according to the
&gt;emotions of the board of C.C.I.  "Saturday Night Special" dogs, such as
&gt;Chihuahuas and other cheap, easily concealed ankle-biters, will also be
&gt;banned.  In addition, the Act bans all sharp canine teeth, all canine teeth
&gt;longer than a federally-mandated length, all spiked collars and sharp
&gt;canine toenails.  It also mandates that all dogs be transferred only
&gt;through federally licensed dog dealers, and provides for the changing of
&gt;the BATF to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Assault Dogs, or
&gt;BATFAD.
&gt;
&gt;I hope that the physicians' organizations who champion total hand-gun
&gt;banning will rally behind this urgent cause to save our nation's children.
&gt;Anyone who opposes this type of legislation obviously hates children.  We
&gt;need this Act desperately - after all, if it saves only one life, it is
&gt;worth it.  Not to mention the $102.4 million dollars in ER charges!
&gt;
&gt;My husband's face was horribly mauled at the age of four by a Pit Bull;
&gt;today he is the poster child for C.C.I.  Now, when not being used as a
&gt;drooling doorstop or for first base, he is routinely wheeled out at charity
&gt;fund-raising events at which he repeatedly mumbles, "Bad dogs!  Ban dogs!"
&gt;
&gt;We urgently need your help to get these vicious dogs off the streets now!
&gt;Please help end canine violence in America!  Send donations to: C.C.I.,
&gt;1111 B.S. Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20004.
&gt;
&gt;Make the checks out to me.

&gt;c) 1998 by Tina Terry.  This letter may be reprinted in its entirety, as
&gt;long as nothing in it is changed, credit is given the author, and the
&gt;following is included.  Author's note: The author's husband's face really
&gt;was mauled at age 4 by a Pit Bull, an incident in which he almost lost an
&gt;eye.  He's not in a wheelchair, true, but he also doesn't blame dogs in
&gt;general for his early experience and he loves and owns dogs to this day.  He
&gt;also has never tried to enlist the author to run around the country trying
&gt;to ban all dogs.
