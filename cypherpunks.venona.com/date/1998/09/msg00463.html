&gt; There's also the idea popular in some gender feminist circles that the

&gt; than the president of the United States and an intern? Where are the
&gt; feminist cries of outrage?

"But Clinton is on their side!"

I think the gender feminists are being quiet because they supported
Clinton.  It all comes down to politics.  There are other feminists I know
(of the non-politically correct variety) that have very unkind things to
say about the man.

&gt; &gt; * Lawmaking is paralzyed, frozen, stillborne. This I count as a Good Thing.
&gt; &gt; Even better will be another 8-10 months of this nightly spectacle. No
&gt; &gt; Health Care Reform, no Communications Decency Act II, no Tobacco Act,
&gt; &gt; nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; In general you might be right. But for "noncontroversial" measures like
&gt; CDA II, well, it'll be in one of the appropriations bills that will be
&gt; approved in the next three weeks.

Actually this is *JUST* the time for moralistic political posturing.
Expect to see a great deal of "holier than thou" legislation put through
under "bringing back morality to America". (And anyone who tries to fight
such lunacy will be labeled a hedonistic scum.)

It is scandals just like this that fuel the fires of the anti-sex league.

&gt; &gt; * This disgraces the Presidency, which I also count as a Good Thing. There
&gt; &gt; were hopes that Nixon's downfall would be the end of the Imperial
&gt; &gt; Presidency, but, alas, the pomp and circumstance continued unabated. It's
&gt; 
&gt; The balance of power in the U.S. government is too tilted in favor of the
&gt; executive and federal agencies; I think more should be returned to
&gt; Congress and the states but don't think we're going to see that happen. To
&gt; do that Congress needs to be willing to seize it; they're not. If we get
&gt; Al Gore in the Oval Office we'll have business as usual.

And remember that Tipper is part of that baggage.  Expect a moralistic
crusade or two from the first lady if that happens.
