I link to I believe seven messages in my article today.

The one that Gordon apparently cites is this:

[Bienfait Nutly News-Sidney, Montana]A BIENFAIT CYPHERPUNKS
Distributed meeting took place early this morning via an
BlackBox hookup between the South 40, in Sidney, and the
CoalDust Saloon, in Bienfait.
The main issue of discussion was as to whether anyone was
sober enough to remember where the MadBomber In Possession
Of The Last False Smile had actually placed the bomb before
embarking on a middle-leg of the TruthMonger SoftTarget Tour
of Planet Terra.

Estevan City Police, hearing rumors of the Virtual Attack
on the Saskatchewan Justice System via the MeatSpace tools
commonly available to those who own no firearms and don't
need no stinking badges, chose to delay a search for the
bomb, in order to plan what type of news spin should be
put on the event in order to maximize the justification
for an increased local police budget to combat international
terrorism, child pornography, drug-dealing and A HorseMan

&gt; We're putting together copies of cpunk messages Jeff 
&gt; Gordon cites in the Carl Johnson complaint and have 
&gt; found all in the archives except one dated June10, 1998. 
&gt; Jeff describes it:
&gt; 
&gt;    15. On June 10, 1998, an anonymous message was 
&gt;    posted to the Cypherpunks Internet group. In the
&gt;    message, it is stated that the bomber "placed the bomb 
&gt;    before embarking on a middle-leg of the TruthMonger
&gt;    SoftTarget Tour of Planet Terra." The message also 
&gt;    referenced an RCMP plan to "drive a known madman 
&gt;    crazy enough to finally put him away turned bad, and
&gt;    resulted in a backlash of death and destruction ..." I 
&gt;    noted that this message contained information about the
&gt;    courthouse bomb incident which had not previously been 
&gt;    made public, and was written in a style and manner
&gt;    which I recognized as being similar to other writings 
&gt;    which my investigation has linked to JOHNSON. In his
&gt;    interview with Special Agent Sheridan, JOHNSON 
&gt;    acknowledged using the name TruthMonger, and also
&gt;    stated he had psychological problems, both of which 
&gt;    correspond to this message. 
&gt; 
&gt; We'd appreciate getting a copy (yes, Jeff, if you would, anon ok).
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, there's a brief message from Lucky Green yesterday
&gt; in the archives on CEJ which did not appear on the
&gt; cyberpass list, AFAIK, although it was sent to ssz.com. Do such
&gt; gaps happen much in CDR?
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, yeah, I post to toad, and aim to be the last one who
&gt; does, so drive me AP-mad.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW2, anybody know what Linda Reed thinks of her infame?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW3, we heard from TX that CJ's music/perform art is going to 
&gt; be boosted in concert with his god-sent cornseed of publicity.
