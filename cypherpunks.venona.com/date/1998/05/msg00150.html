Announcement Date: May 13, 1998


The Philodox Symposium on Digital Bearer Transaction Settlement
The Downtown Harvard Club
Boston, Massachusetts
July 23-24, 1998

Philodox Financial Technology Evangelism, of Boston, Massachusetts, in
association with the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, announces the
first in a series of symposia, conferences and workshops on the subject of
digital bearer transaction settlement.

The first of these gatherings, a symposium examining the technology,
economics, markets and law of digital bearer settlement, will be held at
the Harvard Club of Boston, Thursday and Friday, July 23 and 24, 1998.


What is Digital Bearer Settlement?

A digital bearer transaction is one where a cryptographically secure
value-object, issued and underwritten by a third party, is exchanged
between the two parties in a trade, typically over a public internetwork.
The object, when passed in trade for something else of value, executes,
clears, and settles the transaction instantaneously, securely, and,
usually, anonymously. And, at considerable savings in transaction cost
compared to "book-entry" transactions, such as credit and debit cards,
checks, and modern securities clearing methods.

It is estimated that $100 billion in transactions are being executed on the
internet annually.  40% of all retail stock trades are now executed from
the net, for instance. If it's possible to properly call a credit card
transaction transmitted under Secure Socket Layer to be settled and cleared
on the net itself, then an estimated maximum of $10 billion of those
transactions, 10%, are actually cleared and settled on the net, with
marginal market share to other transaction protocols. By comparison, $3
trillion in foreign exchange transactions are executed, cleared and settled
every day, using standard book-entry processes.

There are electronic check and debit protocols in experimental development,
but, as transaction settlement time tends towards the instantaneous, the
more cost, security, and non-repudiation advantages there are for digital
bearer settlement.

It is not unreasonable to see how transaction costs can be reduced
enormously by digital bearer settlement, possibly by several orders of
magnitude over any analogous book-entry method. It is completely
conceivable that digital bearer transactions, of all kinds and sizes, from
macrobonds to micropayments, will be executed, cleared, and settled on
ubiquitous global internetworks, and will become the dominant transaction
mechanism over time on those networks, and, by extension, in the global
economy in general.

It may happen sooner than we can imagine. Electronic book-entry settlement
itself is only 40 years old at best, and internet financial cryptography
and digital bearer settlement are much more a phenomenon of collapsing
microprocessor prices than electronic book-entry settlement ever was.


The Philodox Digital Bearer Transaction Settlement Events

Towards that end, Philodox has taken it upon itself to focus the attention
of the information technology, financial and legal communities onto the
technology of digital bearer settlement though the following series of
events. First, this initial Symposium of professionals interested in
digital bearer settlement, to be held in Boston. Then, contingent on
interest, a peer-reviewed Financial Research Conference to be held
during the winter of 1998-99 in Manhattan or Washington, followed by a
small Developer's Conference in the spring of 1999, held in more casual
surroundings, and, finally, a teaching Workshop for Financial Professionals
held in the summer of 1999 at a resort location, probably Bretton Woods, New
Hampshire. It is hoped by Philodox that some, or perhaps, all, of these
events will be recurring ones, and of course, that they will increase in
attendance over time.


The Symposium

Each section of the Symposium agenda will consist of a short presentation
on the topic by the most expert symposium participant on the subject
present, followed by discussions led by a moderator. While it is not
expected that everyone will even be conversant on each topic, it is
expected that participants will bring their own particular expertise to
bear on specific elements of the symposium program, and, of course, not
everyone will have to present something.

We have a lot to teach each other, but, fortunately, most of the people who
are interested enough in this topic to come to this first symposium will
know more than enough to have at least some opinions on the topics under
discussion, and will certainly want to share those opinions with everyone
else.  Finally, there are lots of differing opinions this subject, so
expect some animated discussion.

Because of the expected demand and the size of the Harvard Club space we're
using, participation in the symposium will be limited, and advance
registration will be required. See below for details.

The Digital Bearer Settlement Email List: dbs@philodox.com

As part of Philodox's ongoing support of the technology of digital bearer
settlement, an email list has been established to discuss the technology
and it's ramifications in an unmoderated, informal setting. Please see
&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.philodox.com/">http://www.philodox.com/</A>&gt; to see the archives of the Digital Bearer
Settlement discussion list, and its subscription information.  If there is
enough demand, an additional announcement list for the Symposium itself
will be created, but it is hoped that the Symposium's participants will use
dbs@philodox.com as a "watering hole" for their discussions.


Who is Philodox?

Hettinga, founder of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, and founding
moderator and editor of several internet discussion lists and newsletters
on digital commerce and financial cryptography. Mr Hettinga is also the
