"So, what are you gonna do...spank me?"

The poor salesgirl blushed a deep red as those words came flying out of
Lindas' mouth. I looked at her for a moment then said, "That's exactly what
you need young lady, something to adjust this attitude of yours!" Linda
flushed slightly at this announcement (she always does right before) gave me
a nasty look and began to turn away, I grabbed the sleve of her coat to stop
her. As I pulled her around to face me the 'look' became her pout, there was
little resistance as I propelled her towards the door of the shop. "Keep
that gift there," I said to the clerk, "we'll be back in a few minutes."

We had talked about a semi-public spanking for her, when a few others knew
what would happen to her. There was also the prospect of an accidental
audience. 

7 PM, the parking lot was dimly lit, there were a lot of cars and I had
parked close to the center of the lot. It was a chilly night but about to
'warm-up' for Linda!  Her heels made a sharp 'click' 'click' as we walked
across the cold pavement.
"Shit...I have to go back in there and face her...don't I?"
"Yes, that's the idea, tears, sore bottom and all!"
"Oh shit...does it have to be too...hard?"
"You know the idea, red face, red ass, as hard as I can spank in the back seat."
"Just your hand...only a spanking...nothing else?"
"No, not my hand at all. I brought that little clear paddle that we bought
from 'Glowing Results' just for tonight, I wanted to make sure that there
were tears. Remember how much that stings?"

We arrived at the car, I directed her to the passengers side rear door.
After a fast look around at the other vehicles I turned Linda to face me,
shook my finger in front of her nose and said, "Get in the back seat young
lady, you've earned this one!" The pout was still there as she turned and
entered the back door, I closed it firmly. Sliding in on the drivers side, I
turned to face Linda.

Mother was about to get a REAL spanking!!
