&lt;&lt; ... Considering it's content, I have no doubt that it is manufactured - it
 carefully written to offend millenialist Christians, such as the SDAs.
 I've written the page owner to see if I can find out more. ... &gt;&gt;

Not only that, it seems to be "spam" (the repetitive list type).  You see 2
days ago we welcomed a guest to my list (FreeGroup), and in his first batch,
guess what was there.  Another FreeGroupie had a great response to it, I
include it -

&gt; Well howdy 'yall, i'm mighty proud to have someone to chat wdith and share

&gt;  here's some bad news to start off the day
&gt;  
&gt;  RE: Janet Reno, Attorney General of these United States of America
&gt;  
&gt;  Subject: Janet Reno Quote
&gt;  &gt; Date: Wednesday, May 06, 1998 10:54
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; A friend sent me this...sure would like to see the interview in context,
&gt;  &gt; but at any rate a very scary statement.
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Subject: Cults and Government? 
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; "Just ran across this quote from AG Janet Reno. From a person of such
&gt;  &gt; high power, these are scary words. --------- "
 
&lt;snip - the "spam"&gt;

&gt;  &gt; "-Attorney General Janet Reno, Interview on 60 Minutes, June 26,
&gt;  &gt; 1994"
&gt;  &gt; 

Bad *NEWS*???  This purports to be an item that's nearly 4 years old.  What's
the news?  I guess the news is that we're getting this 3rd hand--at a minimum,
with no idea if it's true or not.  But hey!  This is the internet.  So, again,
I ask, *NEWS*????

Bad beginning, Sir Will.  The willingness to pass along material of dubious
authenticity is not a good sign in my book. As Mr. Natural would say, "Check
your source."  So, what *IS* your source?

Thanks for your excellent research on the origins of that, Peter!

Stan,
