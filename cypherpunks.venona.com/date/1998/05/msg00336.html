DATA FELLOWS ANNOUNCES F-SECURE FILECRYPTO 

New Product Provides Centrally Managed On-the-Fly Protection For Sensitive
Data on Personal Computers

Helsinki, Finland, May 29, 1998  -- Data Fellows, a leading developer of
data security software, today announced F-Secure FileCrypto, the latest
addition to the company’s award-winning cryptographic product line.
F-Secure FileCrypto will provide strong, on-the-fly encryption for
confidential data in the Microsoft Windows 95/98 and NT 4.0 environments.

"F-Secure FileCrypto is the only file encryption product on the market
designed for companies with thousands of PCs," says Mr. Camillo Sars,
Product Manager, Data Fellows. "The protection of confidential files has
never been this easy. F-Secure FileCrypto is centrally installed over the
entire network, and automatically encrypts all open and temporary files.
The process is completely transparent to end-users, requiring no action
from them at all." 

F-Secure FileCrypto is managed from a central location. The administrator
can define a security policy for all installed copies of the software. The
recommended basic policy is encrypting all directories on the local hard
drive.

The program also features a key retrieval function. If a user forgets the
password that allows access to encrypted files, the Administrative Key
Recovery function manages the situation safely and easily.

According to Mr. Sars: "F-Secure FileCrypto is the first and only product
to integrate strong real-time encryption into the Windows file system. It
automatically encrypts data before it gets stored on the hard disk,
protecting sensitive information even in the most demanding situations. If
a PC is improperly turned off, or if a laptop computer’s batteries go dead,
any open or temporary files will be encrypted and safe."

F-Secure FileCrypto also has a feature which allows users to send encrypted
e-mail to other users. Encrypted e-mail can be decrypted with a password.

F-Secure FileCrypto uses well-known fast block cipher algorithms. Either
the three-key 3DES, or the Blowfish algorithm, can be selected. Both
algorithms have been analyzed by the world’s leading cryptographers and are
known to be strong and safe.

"Files protected by F-Secure FileCrypto are not accessible to computer
freaks, hackers, or even cryptography experts. Each file is encrypted with
a random session key. Breaking a single key would give someone access to
only one file, and the job would consume trillions of years of computer
time," says Mr. Sars.

F-Secure FileCrypto for Windows NT 4.0 will be available in July 1998, from
Data Fellows’ resellers around the world. F-Secure FileCrypto for Windows
95 and 98 will be available later this year.
