friends, neighbors, enemies, Employees or anyone else!  My

will give you...


* Thousands of Internet locations to look up people, credit, 

Social security, current or past employment, Driving records, 

medical information, addresses, phone numbers, Maps to city 

locations...



Every day the media (television, radio, and newspapers) are 

full of stories about PERSONAL INFORMATION being used, 

traded, and sold over the Internet... usually without your 

permission or knowledge. 


With my report I show you HOW IT'S DONE!!!

assets.

     anyone! Unlisted phone numbers can often be found 

     through some of these sites!!



Perhaps you're working on a family "tree" or history. The 

Internet turns what once was years of work into hours of 

DISCOVERY &amp; INFORMATION.
