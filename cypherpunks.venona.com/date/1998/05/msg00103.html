&gt; &gt;  U.S. Navy caught hacking
&gt; &gt;  into British marine
&gt; &gt;  charity Web site

&gt; &gt;  "I think whoever it was within the U.S. Navy
&gt; &gt;  facility would have better things to do rather than
&gt; &gt;  try and hack into our computers," said Chris
&gt; &gt;  Stroud, the organization's director of campaigns,
&gt; &gt;  in a statement. "If they were seeking reports on
&gt; &gt;  the Black Sea, we shall be freely publishing these
&gt; &gt;  in the near future anyway."
&gt;
&gt; Consider the possibility that someone hacked into the Navy's computer and
&gt; then used it as a base to hack the Marine Mammal Charity site.

It wouldn't make any sense. Why would a hacker use a military
site that is actively monitored to hack into a site with less security?

And why the requests to get the document originating from the same
source?

Also, from what I have read, the DoD needs come first in everything,
especially Defence Security related issues. No holds barred when they
want something.

This sounds exactly like the kind of information that they would 
want and consider essential, and could thus justify themselves to
get it by any means available. 

Of course, if this was a hacker playing tricks to the US military,
then I'm sure we can expect the military will publish this serious
a security breach, in order to get more money to protect themselves
against any Internet terrorist attacks in the future.

But I bet there will be no public comments or explanation given.
