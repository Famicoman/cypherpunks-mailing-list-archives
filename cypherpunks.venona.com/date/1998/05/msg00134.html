The earliest online citation I can find is in the  May 1997 Newsletter of
the 
Melbourne Seventh-day Adventist Church, at 

<A  HREF="http://www.spacey.net/bwillard/News0597.html">http://www.spacey.net/bwillard/News0597.html</A> 

Considering it's content, I have no doubt that it is manufactured - it
carefully written to offend millenialist Christians, such as the SDAs.
I've written the page owner to see if I can find out more.

Deja News shows this quote first in alt.war.civil.usa, on March 18 1998.
Since then, it's been banging around various Christian and political
groups. 

It also seems to be on the website 
<A  HREF="http://www.sightings.com/political/renowords.htm">http://www.sightings.com/political/renowords.htm</A>, but I have not
confirmed this, nor can I tell if this cites an earlier source.

&gt; I just saw this on one of the newsgroups:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible and the Second
&gt; Coming of Christ; who frequently attends Bible studies; who has a high
&gt; level of financial giving to a Christian cause; who home schools for
&gt; their children; who has accumulated survival foods and has a strong
&gt; belief in the Second Amendment; and who distrusts big government.  Any
&gt; of these may qualify [a person as a cultist] but certainly more than one
&gt; [of these] would cause us to look at this person as a threat, and his
&gt; family as being in a risk situation that qualified for government
&gt; interference."
&gt; -Attorney General Janet Reno, Interview on 60 Minutes, June 26, 1994
