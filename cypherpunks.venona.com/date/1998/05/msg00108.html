<P><B>2.  IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or </B>
<P><B>     their sequence on the list in any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" through</B>

<P><B>5.  For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered.</B>
<P><B>     That's it!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This guarantees that the </B>

Especially the rule of not placing your name in a different position, it won't work and you will lose potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly and you'll be on your way to financial security.

<P>My name is Frank. My wife, Doris and I live in Bel-Air MD.  I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail".  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills!  I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "hobby".  I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.

<P>The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short amount of time.  I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.

<P>     Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy was I surprised when I found my medium sized post office box crammed full of orders!  For a while it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before.  The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. people live.  There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.

<P>     I had received this program before.  I deleted it but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another copy of the program...11 months passed, then it came.  I didn't delete this one!  I made more than $41,000 on the first try!

<P>    This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have quit our jobs and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it.  For your sake, don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
