                              By RICHARD MOORE

                             [CLOSING ARGUMENTS]

                 Presented before the GRAND JURY of LIBERTY

                        On this FOURTH DAY of HEARING

                           The PEOPLE v NWO Et Al

     Defendant 1 - NWO ("Corporate Globalist Elite")

     Defendant 2 - MEDIA ("Corporate Mass Media")

     Defendant 3 - GOVT ("National Government Leadership")

     Defendant 4 - INTELCOM ("Intelligence Community")

     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in the first three days of this
     hearing we have seen how the infrastructures of a police state
     are being established in the United States. Civil liberty
     protections have been systematically dismantled; conspiracy laws
     permit the conviction of people not involved in crimes; police
     forces are being paramilitarised; longer sentences are being
     given for minor offences; prison populations are growing
     dramatically. We have seen how factionalism is being promoted in
     order to divide society against itself; we have seen how the
     evidence shows that dramatic incidents, such as the World Trade
     Centre and Oklahoma Federal Building bombings, have been covertly
     and intentionally staged in order to avoid debate in the
     implementation of police-state measures.

     Today, in these closing arguments, we will examine two points.
     First, we will review the background of the NWO capitalist elite
     in order to understand why political suppression via police-state
     measures is an inevitable necessity for them. Second, we will
     review recent developments in Ireland, to show how police-state
     measures which took years to justify politically in the US are
     being exported wholesale to other Western countries.

     1. Capitalism and the Necessity of Police States in the West

     The religion of the NWO elite is capitalism, and the root of most
     of the problems of the world today, including the development of
     police states in the West, can be traced to the dynamics of
     capitalism. The dictionary definition of "capitalist" begins:

     "An investor of capital in business..."

     What distinguishes capitalism from earlier forms of private
     commerce and trade is the emphasis on external capital investment
     =97 funds which are invested in an enterprise for the purpose of
     increasing the value of the investment. In particular capitalism
     is characterised by stock corporations, where ownership shares in
     a business can be bought and sold.

     Stockholders are technically the owners of an enterprise, but the
     interests of stockholders are not the same as the interests of an
     owner who also operates an enterprise. An owner-operator is
     concerned with operating a healthy business and developing it
     over time. He or she might be interested in growing the business,
     or might just as well be happy for it to stabilise at some
     manageable size and then bring in a stable ongoing profit. But a
     capitalist, an external investor, is interested solely in the
     growth of the business, which is what increases the value of the
     stock investment. A stable business translates into stagnant
     stock values; a business which is merely profitable is not a good
     place for capital investment.

     One can compare a corporation =97 or any investment vehicle =97 to a
     taxicab, and an investor to a rider. The operator of a taxicab is
     concerned with keeping the vehicle in good repair and making a
     regular profit over time. A rider, on the other hand, is only
     concerned with his own use of the vehicle. If the rider gets to
     his destination on time, he has little concern over whether the
     vehicle is damaged in the process. Similarly a capital investor
     uses an investment vehicle. Only a period of growth is required
     by the investor. If the vehicle then falters, investors simply
     sell their shares and reinvest elsewhere. The history of
     capitalism is indeed strewn with the carcasses of boom-and-bust
     corporations, industries, and whole economies.

     In a capitalist economy there is a pool of capital =97 the sum of
     all the money investors are making available. Just as water seeks
     its own level, so this ever-growing capital pool always seeks the
     best available growth opportunities. And just as water over time
     can wear down the highest mountain, so the relentless pressure of
     this growth-seeking capital pool eventually creates an economy
     and society in which growth is the dominant agenda. External
     ownership =97 the separation of ownership from operation =97 is the
     origin of the growth imperative in a capitalist economy.

     The evolution of capitalism proceeds according to the following
     dynamic. In each phase of its development capitalism operates
     within a larger societal regime =97 a particular political,
     cultural, technological, and economic environment. Within this
     regime, under the relentless pressure of the investment pool, the
     various investment vehicles are exploited to the maximum
     practical degree. There always comes a point where further growth
     of the pool becomes problematic or impossible. When such a
     societal growth barrier is encountered, the creative energy of
     capitalism is unleashed on a new objective: changing the
     surrounding societal regime.

     There is thus a characteristic rhythm to capitalist evolution.
     Periods of growth within a regime are punctuated by changes of
     regime designed to create a new period of growth. A new societal
     regime might be characterised by technological changes (the
     Industrial Revolution), by political changes (creation of
     republics), or by new societal projects (imperialism.) Driven by
     its relentless growth imperative, capitalism has become the
     driving force behind societal evolution wherever it has taken
     hold.

     Apologists for capitalism call such societal changes "progress"
     and emphasise whatever real or imagined beneficial qualities
     might be present. In fact such changes have been designed by
     human creativity yoked to the objective not of societal
     improvement, but to that of creating new investment vehicles for
     the ever-voracious capital pool. In fact the intentional
     destruction of societies and economies, particularly but not only
     in colonised nations, has been a technique frequently employed to
     create new investment vehicles.

     One of the most important and characteristic societal
     developments brought about by capitalism is the rise of
     capitalist elite oligarchies. Given that the evolution of
     capitalism proceeds through an ongoing series of intentional
     societal changes, it is only natural that the mechanisms of
     societal control would themselves evolve over time and eventually
     be consolidated into political domination by a capitalist elite.

          People of the same trade seldom meet together... but
          the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the
          public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.
          =97 Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations

     In every society where capitalism has taken hold, a dominant
     capitalist oligarchy has in fact emerged, along with the
     establishment of institutions designed to further elite interests
     in a systematic way. Today, the United States itself has become a
     vehicle for managing world events so as to facilitate investment,
     to make the world safe for capitalism. Transnational corporations
     (TNC=92s) have evolved into gigantic engines for generating capital
     growth, and TNC-dominated bureaucracies (International Monetary
     Fund (IMF), World Trade Organisation, et al) are being given
     global decision-making power over a wide range of issues, loosely
     called economic =97 and those institutions are rapidly becoming in
     all but name a world government.

     Global capitalism today is coming up against several constraints,
     and globalisation, in its full NWO dimensionality, can be seen as
     the creative attempt by very competent, corporate-funded planners
     to overcome those constraints. One of the constraints comes from
     the very global success of capitalism =97 there is no longer any
     possibility of growth through territorial expansion. Other means
     of growth =97 and many have been perfected over the years =97 must b=
e
     deployed.

     In Southeast Asia, in Africa, and in the former Soviet Union, the
     policies of Western finance capital and of its tool, the IMF,
     have created capital-growth vehicles through the intentional
     destruction of once healthy economies. In South Korea, for
     example, Western over-investment was followed by the sudden
     withdrawal of funds and credit. Thus a financial bubble was
     created, and when it burst the South Korean currency was
     destroyed and the national finances were depleted.

     In desperate need of finance, South Korea was forced to turn to
     the IMF. The IMF then came forward with one of its infamous
     "restructuring" programs which in truth should be called
     "demolition" programs. Sound businesses that had been thriving
     only weeks before were forced into bankruptcy; South Korea was
     forced to change its social and labour policies from top to
     bottom; the systems were dismantled which had been responsible
     for South Korea=92s postwar economic success.

     These so-called IMF "reforms" which were forced on South Korea
     had nothing to do with the causes of the financial collapse. Not
     only that, but the IMF "rescue funds" did not go to South Korea
     at all, but were rather used to repay the external investors
     whose market manipulations had caused the collapse. While Western
     taxpayers fund the IMF, and Southeast Asian (and other)
     populations suffer the consequences of IMF policies, it is
     Western capital that reaps all the benefits.

     What were the benefits reaped by Western capital? To begin with,
     the IMF bailout of the investors means that Western capital was
     first able to profit from the decades of South Korean growth, but
     was then protected when the bubble burst. Global capitalism has
     been called "casino capitalism", and the IMF makes sure that the
     big players cannot lose in this game, no matter which cards turn
     up.

     But that was only the beginning. To understand the primary
     benefit derived from destroying the South Korean economy, we must
     note that capitalism is currently suffering from what is called a
     "crisis of over-production". The efficiency and size of TNC
     producers have evolved to the degree where much more can be
     produced than can possibly be consumed. In automobiles,
     electronics, and many other industries there are simply too many
     producers chasing too few consumers.

     Interventions such as in South Korea and the former Soviet Union
     have become a systematic mechanism to selectively cull global
     competitors, thus creating growth room for those that remain. In
     addition, the assets and productive capacity of the victims have
     been made available at bargain prices for purchase by Western
     interests.

     This selective destruction of economies is a "regime change" in
     the global society, designed to create growth vehicles for the
     Western capital pool. Elimination of producers creates growth
     room in the global economy for Western operators; bargain
     purchase of assets increases monopoly concentration of global
     commerce in Western hands; destabilised societies are forced to
     import what they formerly produced for themselves, further
     increasing Western capital-growth opportunities.

     One of the myths of globalisation is that it represents a
     relative decline of Western interests, that market forces will
     allow other regions to make inroads against traditional Western
     domination. With the postwar economic rise of Japan and later
     Southeast Asia, this myth in fact gained considerable
     credibility. But as the postwar boom began to level out, and a
     new regime of growth became necessary, it has become clear that
     the global capital elite remains primarily a Western elite. The
     IMF is in fact dominated primarily by Western-based interests,
     and its power has been used to selectively cull non-Western
     operators.

     While the IMF culls competitors using the power of the purse
     strings, the US and NATO accomplish the same objective in other
     ways. In the case of the petroleum market, where limiting supply
     is crucial to maintaining desired global oil prices, geopolitical
     machinations have been employed to restrict at various times the
     production of Iran, Iraq, Libya, and others. By encouraging the
     split-up of Yugoslavia, which competed in several world markets
     including automobile production, additional culling was
     accomplished.

     As capitalism enters its global era, it is doing so under the
     control of the Western capitalist elite. This elite dominates the
     leading Western nations politically, even more firmly controls
     the foreign policies of those nations, and totally controls the
     policies of the IMF, the World Bank, and the other institutions
     of the global governmental apparatus. All the potent agencies
     which determine the course of global societal evolution are
     firmly in the control of the Western elite.

     But in another sense the decline of the West is not myth but
     reality. Western elites remain in firm control and continue to
     prosper under globalisation, but Western societies are in fact in
     decline =97 economically, culturally, and politically. This decline
     is intentional, planned and implemented by the capitalist elite
     as a societal change designed, as always, to create growth
     vehicles for the capital pool.

     This particular episode of Western societal engineering is called
     the "neoliberal revolution" and it was formally launched with the
     candidacies of Ronald Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher in
     the UK, and with the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in Europe.
     The agenda of the neoliberal revolution is summed up in the
     all-too-familiar mantra "free trade, deregulation, privatisation,
     and reform". The true meaning of this agenda can be easily found
     by analysing each transaction in terms of its consequences for
     capital growth.

     Free trade, whose practical definition must be inferred from the
     terms of the international free-trade agreements, in fact means
     the elimination of national sovereignty over the flow of capital
     and goods. The consequence is that TNC=92s have more flexibility in
     optimising production and distribution, and in exploiting the
     opportunities created by the culling of competitors. This
     flexibility is the growth vehicle provided by the free-trade
     plank of the neoliberal platform.

     Deregulation refers to the elimination of national sovereignty
     over corporate concentration, capital movement, corporate
     operations, pricing, and product standards. Again the benefit is
     clear. Greater freedom in concentrating ownership, shifting
     capital, operating without environmental or other restraints,
     raising prices, and reducing standards =97 these all provide
     vehicles for growth in this neoliberal phase of capitalism in
     Western economies.

     Privatisation refers to the sale of national assets to corporate
     operators and the transfer of control over national
     infrastructures to those operators. Each such transfer creates an
     immediate growth vehicle for capital, in the exploitation of the
     asset and the infrastructure. In addition the transfers have been
     in fact sweetheart deals where negotiators on both sides of the
     transactions have represented the interests of the same
     capitalist elite. Asset values have been heavily discounted,
     through various tried-and-true trickeries of accounting, and the
     "sales" have in fact represented immediate transfers of wealth
     from public ownership directly into corporate coffers. The sale
     transactions themselves are growth vehicles.

     Reform, besides referring to generic compliance with the
     neoliberal agenda, also means reducing the taxes of corporations
     and the wealthy, eliminating social services, and generally
     cutting back the functions of government. Obviously these tax
     changes serve to grow the capital pool. The elimination of social
     services also serves as a growth vehicle in two ways. Workers
     become hungrier for employment, creating a downward pressure on
     wages. New enterprises can be started in order to provide the
     services formerly provided by government (medical care,
     insurance, etc).

     The general cutting back of government functions is simply part
     of the sovereignty transfer from national governments to the
     centralised regime of global institutions. As power and
     administration is concentrated globally, the role of national
     governments is being reduced and refocused. As has been long true
     of governments in much of the Third World, the role of Western
     governments is devolving toward three major functions: conforming
     to the dictates of the global regime, making payments on the
     national debt, and controlling the domestic population. The
     paramilitarisation of police forces, the rise in prison
     populations, and the extension of police powers are very
     necessary societal changes required to enable the full
     implementation of the neoliberal agenda.

     It is no accident that in the USA, where the neoliberal agenda
     has been most thoroughly implemented, the collateral police-state
     apparatus is also most thoroughly deployed. SWAT teams, midnight
     raids, property confiscations, mandatory and draconian
     sentencing, a booming prison-construction industry, increased
     surveillance and monitoring of individuals and organisations =97
     these are all an increasing part of the American scene.
     Government officials have stated that Americans must expect even
     more dramatic security measures, and that military vehicles and
     weapons can be expected in domestic situations where warranted by
     security concerns.

     The neoliberal agenda in fact amounts to the dismantlement of
     Western societies, undoing what was in some sense many decades of
     social progress. Although the dominant global elite remains based
     in the West, strong Western societies are no longer required
     under the global regime, as they were in the era of competitive
     nationalism. Just as the IMF devastates non-Western societies in
     ways that provide growth vehicles, so the neoliberal revolution
     devastates Western societies for the same purpose, if at a
     somewhat more gradual pace. Police-state regimes, whether or not
     acknowledged by that name, are an inevitable necessity if Western
     nations are to be kept in line as the neoliberal dismantlement,
     which is still in its early days, continues to unfold.

     2. Exporting the Police State: Ireland and the Omagh Bombing

     I=92ve been living in the UK and Ireland for over four years. I=92ve
     been observing the peace process and the tactics of the various
     sides, including several Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombings.
     While by no means condoning violent methods, I have been
     nonetheless impressed by the care that went into the planning and
     execution of most of the IRA=92s operations.

     Huge bombs were set off in London, in the heart of the financial
     district and at the Docksides complex, causing immense property
     damage and embarrassment to British officials, with surprisingly
     little injury or loss of life. Without approving of violence, one
     can still acknowledge that the IRA has, at least in recent years,
     been politically astute in their (nonetheless unjustifiable)
     operations.

     The Omagh bombing was totally out of character; it made no sense
     whatsoever within the political context of Northern Ireland and
     the progress of the peace process. Certainly there are dissident
     elements who aren=92t satisfied with the compromises that have been
     reached, but accommodations have been made to all sides, and the
     overwhelming spirit in both North and South is to reach a
     settlement and put the "troubles behind us".

     The Omagh bombing was the most deadly of the entire 30-year
     "troubles". It was out of character not only by its timing, but
     also in terms of its scale. My first response on hearing of it
     was "Where did this come from?" It seemed to have come from out
     of the blue, totally unrelated to the Irish context. It felt like
     one of the "staged dramatic incidents" that we reviewed in the
     previous instalment of this Indictment (see New Dawn No. 48).
     Suspicious, I waited for the other shoe to drop.

     I didn=92t have to wait long. The headline on page seven of the
     Irish Times for September 1st reads: "Harsh measures =91regrettably
     necessary=92 to fight terrorism." Here we read of a fourteen-point
     anti-terrorism bill that is, in its essentials, copied directly
     from the police-state provisions that have been adopted in
     varying degrees by the US and Britain.

     A suspect who refuses to answer questions, can have his silence
     used against him. The silence itself can be "inferred" as being
     corroborating evidence against the suspect. The right to trial by
     jury becomes little more than a sham: if the suspect doesn=92t
     confess all, he either opens himself to perjury (by lying) or
     else builds, through silence, an "inferred" case against himself.

     The validity of trial by jury is further undermined by a another
     provision, which requires the defense to announce to the
     prosecution, in advance of a trial, all witnesses it is going to
     call. Thus the prosecution is armed in advance with the strategy
     of the defense, much to its advantage. And witnesses are exposed
     to possible harassment leading up to the trial, the fear of which
     could have a chilling effect on their willingness to testify.

     As if that weren=92t enough, a suspect is expected to divulge,
     under police questioning, every bit of evidence that he might
     rely on in his defense. Otherwise "inferences" can be drawn. The
     very vagueness of "inferences" still further extends the power of
     the state over that of the accused in what has become a mockery
     of a criminal trial.

     The "conduct" of an accused =97 by which he can be judged guilty =97
     is re-defined to include "movements, activities, actions or
     associations". The critical word here is "associations". If you
     can be proved to be a member of an organisation, and if that
     organisation engages in illegal acts, then your mere association
     makes you to some degree a party to the acts. This provision
     establishes in Ireland what in the US are known as conspiracy
     laws. Such laws, in conjunction with agent provocateurs, can be
     used to suppress popular organisations which legitimately and
     legally oppose government policies.

     Just as the US President, under police-state provisions, can
     declare any organisation to be a "terrorist organisation", so can
     the Irish government "suppress" any organisation under the 1939
     "Offences Against the State" act. The new "regrettable measures"
     of the anti-terrorism bill extend considerably the power of the
     state to succeed in suppressing any organisation it decides it
     doesn=92t like.

     Under the charge of "directing an unlawful organisation", one can
     receive life imprisonment. "Directing", it turns out, means
     directing the activities of the organisation "at any level".
     Thus, if an organisation has been officially "suppressed", all of
     its leaders down to the precinct level can be rounded up and put
     in prison with the key thrown away =97 simply for being leaders,
     and even if the organisation is engaged in no illegal activity.

     Under the charge of "unlawful collection of information" one can
     be imprisoned for up to 10 years. If you have maps and lists of
     people, perhaps to support political organising, and the
     prosecutor says you were planning a terrorist network, it is up
     to you to prove he=92s wrong. Again trial by jury is made a
     mockery. Instead of the state proving its case beyond a
     reasonable doubt, it is up to the accused to prove they aren=92t
     guilty.

     During thirty years of troubles such anti-terrorist provisions
     were not considered necessary. Then on the very eve of final
     settlement a mysterious, uncharacteristic "incident" occurs in
     Omagh, and with suspicious suddenness the Irish government comes
     up with an anti-terrorism bill which mimics the "latest
     developments" in the police-state provisions of the US and
     Britain.

     The parallels between the Oklahoma City and Omagh bombing
     scenarios are striking. Both were unprecedented in their scale of
     death and injury; neither made any sense in terms of being a
     "political statement" for any group or organisation; the
     circumstance of both were highly suspicious; both were
     immediately followed by the passage of omnibus anti-terrorism
     bills without debate.

     Summary

     The pattern, then, is clear. The US leads the way in the
     development of police-state measures and of the means to get them
     implemented without debate. The measures are then exported to
     other countries by the tried-and-true method of staging dramatic
     incidents. Globalisation is a very systematic process, as we have
     seen in the pattern of IMF interventions, and as we can see in
     the establishment of global governing institutions. It is no
     surprise that a systematic means have been developed to implement
     the police-state regimes which are required to fulfill the aims
     of the neoliberal revolution.

     The evidence, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is clear. Our NWO
     elite leaders are committed to the program of corporate
     globalisation. They are compelled to this strategy by the need to
     keep their capital pool growing. Reducing Western populations to
     Third-World status is a necessary part of their plans for the
     globalisation of the economy and the consolidation of all power
     in their centralised bureaucracies. The installation of
     police-state regimes is being purposely pursued in order to force
     this elite program on Western populations.

     I suggest to you that the only reasonable verdict is "guilty as
     charged", and that the sentence should be the overthrow of the
     capitalist elite oligarchy, through non-violent democratic
     revolution, and the replacement of the capitalist system by one
     more appropriate to human happiness and well-being.

     I thank you for your attention and invite you to go forth and do
     your duty as free men and women to secure the future of the Earth
     and of your progeny.
