&gt;The Wassenaar Invasion of Privacy
&gt;
&gt;by J. Orlin Grabbe
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the first moment it proclaimed the "information superhighway", the
&gt;Clinton administration has waged a wholesale assault on Internet free
&gt;speech and privacy.
&gt;
&gt;The latest blow is the Clinton administration's strong- arming of the 32
&gt;fellow countries of the Wassenaar Arrangement to agree to an export ban
&gt;on strong cryptographic (data scrambling) software. The net effect will
&gt;be to make it easier for each government to read its own citizen's email
&gt;and other private documents.
&gt;
&gt;Normally if a nation attempts to restrict the domestic sale of strong
&gt;encryption software, that attempt is made ineffective by the
&gt;availability of strong encryption software from other countries. But
&gt;such software won't be available anymore--at least not from one of the
&gt;Wassenaar countries, once they have enacted local legislation to
&gt;implement the terms of the Wassenaar agreement of December 2.
&gt;
&gt;The Wassenaar Arrangement is supposed to be an intergovernmental
&gt;agreement to restrict international traffic in arms. What does this have
&gt;to do with encryption? Simply this: the US government still holds that
&gt;secret-code-producing software is a munition. So if you encrypt your
&gt;letters and files, and the government hasn't given you permission to use
&gt;that caliber encryption, then the person who gave you the encryption
&gt;software may be in violation of some regulation on arms dealing.
&gt;
&gt;"They've plugged a loophole," gleefully proclaimed Ambassador David
&gt;Aaron, the President's Special Envoy for Cryptology. The day following
&gt;the agreement, the US Department of Commerce issued a press release in
&gt;which Aaron spouts gobble-de-gook phrases about a "level playing field"
&gt;and about balancing "commercial and privacy interests with national
&gt;security and public safety concerns" (see Appendix A for Commerce Dept.
&gt;press statement).
&gt;
&gt;How has this agreement supposedly created a "level playing field" and
&gt;helped U.S. industry? Well, namely, by censoring foreign publishers of
&gt;cryptology software in the same way that the US government already
&gt;censors US publishers. This is similar to arguing that by increasing
&gt;tyranny in surrounding countries, we can create a "level playing field"
&gt;for freedom.
&gt;
&gt;"It's ironic, but the US government is leading the charge
&gt;internationally to restrict personal privacy and individual liberty
&gt;around the world," said Alan Davidson, a staff counsel at the Center for
&gt;Democracy and Technology, according to Reuters (see Appendix B for
&gt;Reuter's news release).
&gt;
&gt;A restriction on cryptology is a restriction on free speech. In the
&gt;Second World War, the US used native Navaho speakers for secure
&gt;communications. Since no one else understood the language, it served as
&gt;a powerful secret code. But is what you speak or write in an email
&gt;message suddenly not speech or language if the government can't
&gt;understand it? If your message says "Xu23MN iilc]z MNBl", does the
&gt;government suddenly have the right to imprison you for writing
&gt;gibberish?
&gt;
&gt;While the clear answer is No, nevertheless the US government thinks it
&gt;has the right to restrict your "gibberish" if it is produced by
&gt;encryption software that it can't crack. The Wassenaar agreement says
&gt;encryption software that is "weak" (less than 56 bit keys in some cases,
&gt;or less than 64 bit keys in others), so that the government can
&gt;unscramble and read the real message underneath the gibberish, is okay,
&gt;and in fact frees up some export restrictions on this type of software.
&gt;The trade-off? Greater restrictions on software that produces secret
&gt;code the government can't read.
&gt;
&gt;Arms control. It sounds wonderful, doesn't it? Go over to the Wassenaar
&gt; web page and take a look. High nobility of purpose, right? "We're
&gt;keeping those guns away from the Indians," they proclaim. But what they
&gt;mean to say is: "We fully intend to read what is written on the hard
&gt;drive of your computer."
&gt;
&gt;Posting to the cypherpunks mailing list, Timothy May noted:
&gt;
&gt;I recently heard T. J. Rodgers, CEO of Cypress Semiconductor, repeat his
&gt;oft-made point that Silicon Valley and the high tech industry gains
&gt;nothing by talking to Washington. That as soon as dialog is started with
&gt;Washington, things get worse. This applies as well to crypto, to gun
&gt;rights, to everything. Everything Washington touches turns to statist
&gt;shit.
&gt;
&gt;Is there any good news? Enabling legislation has to be enacted in each
&gt;country to carry out the terms of the Wassenaar agreement. Raising a hue
&gt;and cry with legislators over this latest invasion of privacy should
&gt;have a positive effect.
&gt;
&gt;In the meantime, Mr. "Information Superhighway" Al Gore is poised for a
&gt;presidential run, so he can continue to ignore privacy concerns and bend
&gt;over for the Big Brother agencies of the national security
&gt;establishment.

&gt;
&gt;U.S. Applauds Agreement on Encryption in International Export
&gt;Control Regime
&gt;
&gt;Vienna, Austria -- The United States welcomed the decision taken
&gt;Thursday in Vienna by the 33 members of the Wassenaar Arrangement
&gt;to modernize and improve multilateral encryption export controls.
&gt;Ambassador David Aaron, the President's Special Envoy for Cryptology,
&gt;said that "the international agreement reached here goes a long way
&gt;toward leveling the playing field for exporters and promoting
&gt;electornic commerce.  It provides countries with a stronger
&gt;regulatory framework to protect national security and public safety."
&gt;
&gt;The agreement caps a two year effort by the United States, to update
&gt;international encryption export controls and to balance commercial
&gt;and privacy interests with national security and public safety
&gt;concerns. Thursday's agreement simplifies and streamlines controls
&gt;on many encryption items and eliminates multilateral reporting
&gt;requirements. Specific improvements to multilateral encryption
&gt;controls include removing controls on all encryption products at
&gt;or below 56 bit and certain consumer entertainment TV systems, such
&gt;as DVD products, and on cordless telephone systems designed for
&gt;home or office use.
&gt;
&gt;Wassenaar members also agreed to extend controls to mass-market
&gt;encryption above 64 bits, thus closing a significant loophole in
&gt;multilateral encryption controls.  This gives Wassenaar member
&gt;governments the legal authority to license many mass market
&gt;encryption software exports which were previously not covered by
&gt;multilateral controls and enables governments to review the
&gt;dissemination of the strongest encryption products that might
&gt;fall into the hands of rogue end users.   The new controls also
&gt;extend liberalized mass-market hardware below 64 bits.  Until
&gt;today, only mass-market software products enjoyed this
&gt;liberalized treatment.
&gt;
&gt;"The decisions taken here in Vienna reinforce the Administration's
&gt;efforts to promote a balanced encryption policy," Aaron confirmed.

&gt;Appendix B: Reuters News Release

&gt;
&gt;Thursday, 3 December 1998 12:57:40
&gt;
&gt;U.S. claims success in curbing encryption trade
&gt;
&gt;Aaron Pressman, Reuters, Washington newsroom, 202-898-8312
&gt;
&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Clinton administration officials
&gt;Thursday said they had persuaded other leading countries to
&gt;impose strict new export controls on computer
&gt;data-scrambling products under the guise of arms control.
&gt;
&gt;At a meeting Thursday in Vienna, the 33 nations that have
&gt;signed the Wassenaar Arrangement limiting arms exports --
&gt;including Japan, Germany and Britain -- agreed to impose
&gt;controls on the most powerful data-scrambling technologies,
&gt;including for the first time mass-market software, U.S.
&gt;special envoy for cryptography David Aaron told Reuters.
&gt;
&gt;The United States, which restricts exports of a wide range of
&gt;data-scrambling products and software -- also known as
&gt;encryption -- has long sought without success to persuade
&gt;other countries to impose similar restrictions.
&gt;
&gt;``We think this is very important in terms of bringing a level
&gt;playing field for our exporters,'' Aaron said.
&gt;
&gt;Leading U.S. high-technology companies, including Microsoft
&gt;Corp. and Intel Corp., have complained that the lack of
&gt;restrictions in other countries hampered their ability to
&gt;compete abroad. The industry has sought to have U.S.
&gt;restrictions relaxed or repealed, but has not asked for tighter
&gt;controls in other countries.
&gt;
&gt;Privacy advocates have also staunchly opposed U.S. export
&gt;controls on encryption, arguing that data-scrambling
&gt;technologies provided a crucial means of protecting privacy in
&gt;the digital age.
&gt;
&gt;``It's ironic, but the U.S. government is leading the charge
&gt;internationally to restrict personal privacy and individual
&gt;liberty around the world,'' said Alan Davidson, staff counsel at
&gt;the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based
&gt;advocacy group.
&gt;
&gt;Special envoy Aaron said the Wassenaar countries agreed to
&gt;continue export controls on powerful encryption products in
&gt;general but decided to end an exemption for widely available
&gt;software containing such capabilities.
&gt;
&gt;``They plugged a loophole,'' Aaron said.
&gt;
&gt;The new policy also reduced reporting and paperwork
&gt;requirements and specifically excluded from export controls
&gt;products that used encryption to protect intellectual property
&gt;-- such as movies or recordings sent over the Internet -- from
&gt;illegal copying, Aaron said.
&gt;
&gt;Encryption uses mathematical formulas to scramble
&gt;information and render it unreadable without a password or
&gt;software ``key.'' One important measure of the strength of the
&gt;encryption is the length of the software key, measured in bits,
&gt;the ones and zeros that make up the smallest unit of computer
&gt;data.
&gt;
&gt;With the increasing speed and falling prices of computers,
&gt;data encrypted with a key 40 bits long that was considered
&gt;highly secure several years ago can now be cracked in a few
&gt;hours. Cutting-edge electronic commerce and communications
&gt;programs typically use 128-bit or longer keys.
&gt;
&gt;Under Thursday's agreement, Wassenaar countries would
&gt;restrict exports of general encryption products using more
&gt;than 56-bit keys and mass-market products with keys more
&gt;than 64 bits long, Aaron said.
&gt;
&gt;Each country must now draft its own rules to implement the
&gt;agreement.
