                Liberty Electronic Press -- News Release                    
                            ***************


What you are about to learn here may be shocking to you so be pre-
pared to learn what most Americans don’t know.
First of all there are TWO different American Flags. The most common
one you all have seen and recognize. It’s Old Glory with the Stars
and Stripes as you most commonly see displayed outside homes, offices
and the Post Office. It is the Flag of "The Republic united States of
America". The lower case u in the word united, is proper, and is as
written in "The Declaration of Independence".

Our other American Flag is just the same as Old Glory accept it has
a yellow fringe around it. This flag is an Admiralty Flag and is
usually displayed indoors in government offices and many court rooms.
Just as there are two different American Flags there are two dif-
ferent American Governments. I’m not referring to political parties.
The two governments are: "The Republic united States of America",
flying Old Glory and "The [district] United States of America" flying
Old Glory with the yellow fringe, or the Admiralty Flag.

"The Republic united States of America" gives you RIGHTS and The
Constitution of the United States.

"The [district] United States", gives you privileges such as allowing
you to sell or deal in Alcohol, Tobacco and fire arms and to own a
corporation.

All Americans that work for the government, whether it be Federal,
State, County or City or live or work on government land such as
Washington, D.C., Guam, Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and
other ceded lands are under the jurisdiction of "The [district] 
United States" and the Admiralty Flag.

If you are not in the jurisdiction of "The [district] United States"
and the Admiralty Flag you can be EXEMPTED from the Federal Income
Tax, filing, withholding, and record keeping. To do this you must get
out of their jurisdiction and refute their jurisdiction over you.
You will then be considered a Non-Resident Alien and a foreign entity
with respect to "The [district] United States".

YOU DO NOT LOOSE ANY RIGHTS AND YOU ARE STILL CONSIDERED AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN. ACTUALLY YOU GAIN A RIGHT, I.E. YOU DON’T HAVE TO PAY 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX!!!



   The Founding Fathers of The United States of America wrote our Con-
stitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence to set us FREE
from TYRANNY and TAXATION.

   Our Founding Fathers did not want our government to make you pay
INCOME TAXES. If you study the Constitution, and the IRS tax laws, you 
will find that paying income taxes is not mandatory.  It is based on a
voluntary system. The LAWS and the SUPREME COURT and the IRS have ruled 
that Federal income taxes are VOLUNTARY and FILING A RETURN IS NOT
REQUIRED in many cases if you properly VOLUNTEER OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND
THEIR JURISDICTION..

   "Our tax system is based on individual self assessment and 
      VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE." - M. Caplin, IRS Commissioner

"OUR TAX SYSTEM IS BASED UPON VOLUNTARY ASSESSMENT AND PAYMENT AND NOT
ON DISTRAINT" -Supreme Court Ruling, Flora v. U.S., 362 U.S. 145

It is very EASY and LEGAL to volunteer out of the IRS tax system, but
you must know the EXACT PROCESS REQUIRED to do this simple task. If
you don’t know the correct way to do this, you could be FINED $500 by
the IRS.

    If you will spend JUST $59.00 we will send you our package:
                  "BEAT THE IRS &amp; PAY-NO-MORE".
