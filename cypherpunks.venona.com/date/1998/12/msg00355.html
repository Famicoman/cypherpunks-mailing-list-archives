Note I have an article up at wired.com about Reinsch's speech yesterday on
crypto at a defense/critical inf event.

&gt;Also by him yesterday on crypto: <A  HREF="http://jya.com/war120798.htm">http://jya.com/war120798.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt;[Begin excerpt]
&gt;
&gt;Encryption continues to be a hotly debated issue. As I stated last
&gt;year, the U.S. continues to support a balanced approach to encryption
&gt;policy which considers privacy and commercial interests as well as
&gt;protecting law enforcement and national security interests.
&gt;Furthermore, we also remain committed to promoting the growth of
&gt;global electronic commerce through secure financial and business
&gt;communications.
&gt;
&gt;Our position has always been to seek industry-led, market-driven
&gt;solutions to achieve a balanced approach. What has changed is the
&gt;direction where technology and the market place are taking us. Key
&gt;recovery technology remains a very important part of our policy;
&gt;however, over the past two years, we have recognized that key recovery
&gt;is not a solution for all problems.
&gt;
&gt;That recognition, brought about in part as a result of our ongoing
&gt;dialogue with industry, has helped us also focus on recoverable
&gt;technologies that can enable law enforcement to continue its
&gt;authorized activities.
&gt;
&gt;As a result, on September 16, Vice President Gore unveiled a policy
&gt;update, which will not end the debate, but which does include steps to
&gt;further streamline exports of key recovery products and other
&gt;recoverable products which allow law enforcement, under proper legal
&gt;authority, recovery of plain text.
&gt;
&gt;The update also provides for 1) the export of 56 bit DES worldwide to
&gt;any end user under a license exception; 2) exports of strong
&gt;encryption to U.S. companies and their subsidiaries under a license
&gt;exception; 3) exports of strong encryption to the insurance and
&gt;medical sectors in 45 countries under a license exception; and 4)
&gt;exports of strong encryption to secure on-line transactions between
&gt;on-line merchants and their customers in 45 countries under a license
&gt;exception. This is consistent with our earlier announcement relating
&gt;to financial institutions.
&gt;
&gt;This is an evolutionary process and we intend to continue our
&gt;dialogue. We must continue to adapt to changes, and we will review 
&gt;our policies again within the year to determine whether further 
&gt;change is necessary. We intend to publish regulations implementing 
&gt;the Vice President's announcement this month.
&gt;
&gt;With respect to developing a common international approach to
&gt;encryption policy, Ambassador David Aaron, our special envoy on
&gt;cryptography, is working with other countries to ensure that our
&gt;policies are compatible. He has found that most major producing
&gt;countries have public safety and national security concerns similar 
&gt;to ours and are interested in developing a harmonized international
&gt;approach regarding compatible infrastructures for electronic commerce
&gt;and for a key management infrastructure. At last week's Wassenaar
&gt;Arrangement plenary session, the participating states approved a
&gt;number of changes to modernize and improve multilateral encryption
&gt;export controls. These changes removed controls on products below 
&gt;56 bits and on certain consumer entertainment systems, such as DVD
&gt;products, and on cordless phone systems designed for home or office
&gt;use.
&gt;
&gt;Most important, participating states agreed to extend controls to
&gt;mass-market encryption exports above 64 bits, thus closing a
&gt;significant loophole. This will enable governments to review the
&gt;dissemination of the strongest encryption products that otherwise
&gt;might fall into the hands of rogue end users.
&gt;
&gt;For those of you deeply interested in the details of our encryption
&gt;policy, we have a specific session devoted to it tomorrow.
