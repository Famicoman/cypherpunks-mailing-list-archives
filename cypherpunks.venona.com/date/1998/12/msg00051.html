Assuming most power plants are similar, all control instrumentation
must have some way to bypass the computers in case of emergency. The
pulp and paper mill I worked in lost +1M$ / day of downtime so when 
a controller went down, the process that was effected went on manual
bypass and everything continued to run. And yes, all "embedded" systems
were eaisly accessable for quick repair/replacement.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have one very, very reliable source within that industry who tells me that
&gt;&gt; the oil refining industry can't cope with the task. I am told that the
&gt;&gt; problem
&gt;&gt; of embedded systems can NOT be fixed EVER, no matter how much time were
&gt;&gt; allowed. WHY? Because the refineries themselves would have to be dismantled
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; uncover these embedded systems. Essentially, the refineries would have to be
&gt;&gt; destroyed and rebuilt!!! These embedded systems are buried within enclosed
&gt;&gt; systems. Identifying, testing and replacing these systems is too
&gt;&gt; impractical.
&gt;&gt; It is financially unsound to do so. The better option is to build new ones.
&gt;&gt; There is no time to do this with less than 400 days left and the time to
&gt;&gt; build
&gt;&gt; a new refinery is 3 to 5 years.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So, what does this mean? My sources, especially the most reliable source
&gt;&gt; tell
&gt;&gt; me that it means that on January 1, 2000... the oil and gas refineries will
&gt;&gt; cease operations. These facilities also have converted their inventory
&gt;&gt; management control systems to small inventory levels so that inventory
&gt;&gt; levels
&gt;&gt; are running about 1 to 2 days capacity. A few years ago, the industry
&gt;&gt; averaged
&gt;&gt; a 1 to 6 month supply in storage tanks. Not so today.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The results: By 1/5/2000 there will be no gasoline, no diesel fuel, no
&gt;&gt; natural gas, no heating oil, no fuel oil products at all. This means trains
&gt;&gt; will have no fuel. Trucks will have no fuel. Cars will have no fuel.
&gt;&gt; Electric
&gt;&gt; Power Plants will have no oil for fuel, nor coal... because there will be no
&gt;&gt; fuel to power the vehicles to get it to them. So, there will be no
&gt;&gt; electricity. And you know the remaining domino schematic from that point.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ======
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have no way of knowing whether the embedded systems are just that,
&gt;&gt; embedded
&gt;&gt; in such a way that they can not be accessed. I imagine that some could be
&gt;&gt; under fifty feet of concrete or otherwise inaccessable. If this is so, then
&gt;&gt; there is not the slightest doubt at all, that it is indeed all over. Period.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am not going to bandy about the issue of whether this source is reliable
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; not. It makes no difference. The only thing I am concerned with is whether
&gt;&gt; these systems are in fact inaccessable. I know that not every system is
&gt;&gt; inaccessable. The question is whether there are enough inaccessable systems
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; mean that the refineries etc. will not function.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Of course, I would love to hear someone counter this with evidence showing
&gt;&gt; that what has been related above is not true, or it is an urban myth etc.
&gt;&gt; But, I would like 'evidence'. Not conjecture or inuendo or suppositions.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If it were so, that there were indeed these inaccessable systems, would the
&gt;&gt; companies involved let it be known publically? I think not.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If this report is accurate, the remediation is 100% moot as I have said all
&gt;&gt; along, and you can kiss your butt good-bye.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure if I want to play this game Mr. Milne -- you offer this
&gt; article which is, conjecture, innuendo and supposition but demand that
&gt; any counter story be documented by "evidence."  That's pretty tough and,
&gt; frankly, I'm not up to the task as my knowledge is with electric power
&gt; plants -- not oil refineries.
&gt; 
&gt; They do, of course, share some important characteristics and so I'll
&gt; give it a try.  The approach will be from two perspectives -- first,
&gt; I'll explain some power plant construction practices that contradict the
&gt; refinery story; second, I'll offer another review of the nature of the
&gt; "embedded" systems that might be at issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Power Plant (and refinery) construction . . . .
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, power plants and refineries are:
&gt; o Capital intensive
&gt; o Make increased use of computerized process control systems
&gt; o Operate a continuous manufacturing/conversion process employing high
&gt; temperatures and pressures.
&gt; 
&gt; Typical design life of a coal-fired power plant is 40 years.  During
&gt; that period, any number of components *will* fail and *will have to be
&gt; replaced.*  Wouldn't make much sense to put a $500million investment at
&gt; risk 'cause a $20.00 part failed in some inaccessible location.  Thus
&gt; EVERYTHING is accessible.
&gt; 
&gt; You want evidence and I'm not about to take you on a power plant tour
&gt; but even if you've never been inside a power plant the construction
&gt; practice is similar to that found in many other industrial settings and,
&gt; if you've ever been aboard a naval vessel or taken a cruise, ships. 
&gt; These settings are nothing like your home (or even an office) with all
&gt; the infrastructure components nicely hidden behind walls -- pipes are
&gt; exposed and clearly labeled -- power and control cables are laid in
&gt; exposed cable trays and risers.  Electronic components are often mounted
&gt; in racks with easy access from front and back -- probably not at all
&gt; like your computer or home theatre configuration.  All this is to PERMIT
&gt; MAINTENANCE, REPAIR and MODIFICATION.
&gt; 
&gt; So you need to understand that the problem isn't just maintenance, in
&gt; general, or for y2k.  Process plants need to be modified frequently --
&gt; market conditions demand a change in inputs or outputs.  Can't get
&gt; enough sweet crude?  Exxon doesn't close the refinery -- they modify it
&gt; to handle the new feedstock (I got the grand tour from a fellow I knew
&gt; who worked at Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery, years ago).
&gt; 
&gt; Want some pictures?  Here are a few from several "continuous process"
&gt; industries: <A  HREF="http://www.powerprocesspiping.com/">http://www.powerprocesspiping.com/</A>,
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.bdmechanical.com/ppiping.htm">http://www.bdmechanical.com/ppiping.htm</A>,
&gt; <A  HREF="http://silverweb.nf.ca/m&amp;m/cb-p&amp;p.htm">http://silverweb.nf.ca/m&amp;m/cb-p&amp;p.htm</A>, and
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.shambaugh.com/process.htm">http://www.shambaugh.com/process.htm</A>.
&gt; 
&gt; Now consider the nature of these embedded components.  This has been the
&gt; subject of much discussion in csy2k.  I'd like to suggest that there are
&gt; three broad categories of components in this context:
&gt; 
&gt; o The control system(s) -- SCADA -- one or more intelligent nodes build
&gt; on traditional minicomputer, or more recently, microprocessor-based
&gt; server technology.  These are very accessible -- they're in, adjacent
&gt; to, or very near, the control room.  In an even more modern "distributed
&gt; control system," some of the capability will be located in different
&gt; areas of the plant.  Nevertheless, they still have to be very accessible
&gt; -- stuff breaks -- memories get hard, multibit errors, disk drives fail,
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; o Remote devices -- the control systems can't run without data and so
&gt; you have dozens to thousands of remotes -- devices that measure process
&gt; parameters (temperature, pressure, mass flow, volumetric flow,
&gt; acceleration and mechanical position (valve position or tank levels))
&gt; and a smaller number of remotes that can act on SCADA commands (start a
&gt; motor, open a valve, etc.)  Though most of these devices are pretty
&gt; dumb, some may have a bit of silicon-based intelligence and therefore
&gt; susceptible to y2k problems.  BUT, they all have to be accessible
&gt; because 1) they malfunction or need to be recalibrated and 2) plant
&gt; modifications often require removal/replacement to accommodate process
&gt; changes.
&gt; 
&gt; o Embedded systems -- I think that the consensus is that the real
&gt; embedded systems are those systems that are not obviously run by a
&gt; computer -- the power plants water chemistry analyzer or the refineries
&gt; gas chromatograph.  These are on the site but they're not in the "plant"
&gt; -- they're in the lab -- very accessible.
&gt; 
&gt; Now "accessible" doesn't always mean you can walk right up and touch
&gt; it!  Guess where the flue gas monitoring remotes (temperature, opacity)
&gt; are located -- top of the boiler or in the stack.  But here's the
&gt; scenario -- opacity indicator increases (flue gas has more smoke in it)
&gt; but the stack gas "looks" clear.  Do you shut down the plan on
&gt; environment limits or do you send a maintenance man to replace the
&gt; remote?
&gt; 
&gt; Now is it possible that conditions would be different at an oil
&gt; refinery.  Sure, like I wrote at the beginning, I'm not really familar
&gt; with these.  But, really, we'd be looking at some obtuse examples --
&gt; imagine that rather than using a tank level indicator to see how much
&gt; gasoline is in a tank, someone came up with the bright idea of putting a
&gt; strain gauge *under* the tank and determing the amount of product in the
&gt; tank but computing the weight on the gauge and using that to compute the
&gt; amount of product.  The device fails and, we'll all agree, it is not
&gt; practical to replace it.
&gt; 
&gt; Does the refinery stop using the tank?  I wouldn't think so.  They
&gt; retrofit a traditional tank level indicator (float) to provide the
&gt; needed information.
