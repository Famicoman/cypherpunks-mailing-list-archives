&gt;   Anthrax as a Biological Warfare Agent
&gt;      * Anthrax is the preferred biological warfare agent because:
&gt;        
&gt;      * It is highly lethal.
&gt;        
&gt;      * 100 million lethal doses per gram of anthrax material (100,000
&gt;        times deadlier than the deadliest chemical warfare agent).
&gt;      * Silent, invisible killer.
&gt;      * Inhalational anthrax is virtually always fatal.
&gt;        
&gt;      * There are low barriers to production.
&gt;        
&gt;      * Low cost of producing the anthrax material.
&gt;      * Not high-technology. Knowledge is widely available.
&gt;      * Easy to produce in large quantities.
&gt;        
&gt;      * It is easy to weaponize.
&gt;        
&gt;      * It is extremely stable. It can be stored almost indefinitely as a
&gt;        dry powder.
&gt;      * It can be loaded, in a freeze-dried condition, in munitions or
&gt;        disseminated as an aerosol with crude sprayers.
&gt;        
&gt;      * Currently, we have a limited detection capability.
&gt;      * What is Anthrax?
&gt;        
&gt;      * Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease of plant eating animals
&gt;        (goats, sheep, cattle, wine, etc.) caused by the bacterium
&gt;        Bacillus anthracis.
&gt;      * It is an illness which has been recognized since antiquity.
&gt;        Anthrax was common in essentially all areas where livestock are
&gt;        raised. Intensive livestock immunization programs have greatly
&gt;        reduced the occurrence of the disease among both animals and
&gt;        humans in much of the world, an most outbreaks occur in areas
&gt;        where immunization programs have not been implemented or have
&gt;        become compromised (primarily Africa and Asia; however, outbreaks
&gt;        occurred during the mid- I 990's in Haiti and the former Soviet
&gt;        Union).
&gt;      * Anthrax spores can remain viable for several decades under
&gt;        suitable environmental conditions; thus, absence of cases does not
&gt;        equate to absence of risk.
&gt;        
&gt;      * Humans can contract anthrax in three ways:
&gt;        
&gt;      * Through cuts or breaks in the skin resulting from contact with an
&gt;        infected animal (cutaneous anthrax), resulting in local and
&gt;        possibly systemic (bloodstream) infection.
&gt;        
&gt;      * From breathing anthrax spores (termed "woolsorters" disease)
&gt;        resulting in an infection of the lungs (inhalational anthrax).
&gt;        
&gt;      * From eating infected meat, resulting in gastrointestinal infection
&gt;        (gastrointestinal anthrax). Gastrointestinal anthrax is generally
&gt;        not considered a threat to U.S. forces.
&gt;      * What are the symptoms?
&gt;        
&gt;      * Symptoms of anthrax begin after a 1 to 6 day incubation period
&gt;        following exposure.
&gt;        
&gt;      * For contact or cutaneous anthrax, itching will occur at the site
&gt;        of exposure followed by the formation of a lesion. Untreated
&gt;        contact anthrax has a fatality rate of 5-20 percent, but with
&gt;        effective antibiotic treatment, few deaths occur.
&gt;      * Initial symptoms for inhalational anthrax are generally
&gt;        non-specific: low grade fever, a dry hacking cough, and weakness.
&gt;        The person may briefly improve after 2 to 4 days; however within
&gt;        24 hours after this brief improvement, respiratory distress occurs
&gt;        with shock and death following shortly thereafter.
&gt;        
&gt;      * Almost all cases of inhalational anthrax, in which treatment was
&gt;        begun after patients have exhibited symptoms, have resulted in
&gt;        death, regardless of post-exposure treatment.
&gt;      * What is the medical countermeasure?
&gt;        
&gt;      * Prior to exposure, prevention through vaccination, using the
&gt;        FDA-licensed vaccine.
&gt;      * Otherwise, antibiotics such as penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and
&gt;        doxycycline are the drugs of choice for treatment of anthrax.
&gt;      * Treatment with antibiotics must begin prior to the onset of
&gt;        symptoms and must include vaccination prior to discontinuing their
&gt;        use.
&gt;      * The use of antibiotics keep the patient alive until their body can
&gt;        build an immunity to anthrax via vaccination. After symptoms
&gt;        appear however, inhalational anthrax is almost always fatal,
&gt;        regardless of treatment.
