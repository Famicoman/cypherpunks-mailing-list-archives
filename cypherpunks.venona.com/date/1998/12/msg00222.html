&gt; &gt; &gt; Latrines aren't sufficient to the task.  In a city like NYC, latrines
&gt; &gt; &gt; might solve the problem for perhaps a week (assuming that we tear up all
&gt; &gt; &gt; the roads and sidewalks --something which we cannot do in time, even if
&gt; &gt; &gt; we wanted to), but then they'll be full, and there won't be any more
&gt; &gt; &gt; places the latrines can be rotated to.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why, shit is actually pretty compact. usually with latrines, the liquid
&gt; &gt; filtrates out, and the compressed shit does not take too much space.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you dig a deep enough hole (2-3 yards) it should last for a long,
&gt; &gt; long time. I estimate that a human being produces about 1/2 to 1lb
&gt; &gt; of hard waste per day, some are more full of it, some less. Let's settle
&gt; &gt; on one lb per day.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let's see, a hole that is 5 yards wide, 3 yards deep, and, say, 2 yards
&gt; &gt; wide, is about 30 cubic yards. It could take about 40 tons of hard
&gt; &gt; compressed waste, that is, 80 thousand man-days of shitting can be
&gt; &gt; compressed in it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You definitely need some heavy machinery to dig this kind of hole
&gt; &gt; (and then you have to build smoe kind of frame over it to prevent people
&gt; &gt; from falling into it if it collapses), but it is not hard and can even
&gt; &gt; be done in a catastrophic scenario.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's a lot!!! Let's see,a high rise building with 50 floors and 10
&gt; &gt; apartments in each floor, that's about 1200 people. The latrine would
&gt; &gt; last them what, about sixty days! And then they can dig another one.
&gt; 
&gt; This assumes that we can compress it this much, which assumes that we
&gt; have sufficient machinery.  It further assumes that we will be able to
&gt; ignore the "wet" component of human waste.  You can't just pour it down
&gt; the drains.

No, the wet component filtrates out of the hole, into the soil.

Compression happens automaitcally.

&gt; Next, we should realize that these latrines are themselves not going to
&gt; be particularly sanitary, and it would be most unwise to use them for
&gt; any extended period of time.  Hell, even *with* flush toilets, I've seen
&gt; people squatting down in subway stations to take a leak not more than 5
&gt; feet from the restroom.

Yeah, they are not too sanitary, but it is livable.

I refer you to the book "Where there is no doctor" that talks
about it. (a great book, all in all)

&gt; Further, we should realize that for the above reason, people are not
&gt; going to be particularly motivated to use these latrines.  After all,
&gt; nobody wants to hold it for a long time while they wait in line to take
&gt; a leak, just for the privilege of relieving themselves in disease
&gt; central.  You're going to see shit in the street in any case.

I suspect that this will not be happening a lot in the cleaner
parts of the city.

&gt; Finally, even if we dig these holes, (and they're *going* to be bigger
&gt; than what you describe, as they must contain liquid, as well as solid

liquid disspiates.

&gt; waste), we're going to end up messing up the roads something fierce. 
&gt; Big cities *need* roads to transport life-critical items.  If we dig
&gt; them up, we're in even worse trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then we're back to doing it in the open.  Less concentrated cities might
&gt; &gt; &gt; last a while longer, but not much longer.  There's no getting around it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; we *need* working sewer systems to have modern cities.  Otherwise, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cities die.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not in the short run. They could survive for a while.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         - Igor.
&gt; 
&gt; In the *very* short run.  Like, say, a few weeks.  That is if the food
&gt; doesn't stop coming in first --then things finish up a bit sooner.

Well, if you have no food, you make no shit.
