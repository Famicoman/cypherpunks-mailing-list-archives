THE BALL '98
THE NATION'S BIGGEST EVENT FOR JEWISH SINGLES!

       Our annual Ball is the nation's biggest event for Jewish Singles 
in their 20's and 30's.  In 1995, over 3000 young Jewish singles
attended the Ball when we held it at the Palladium.  In 1996, over 
3,500 attended at Webster Hall.  Last year, over 4000 people attended 
this event when we held it at The Tunnel and the party was covered by 
The New York Post, The Daily News, The New York Times, and more.  

      
THE BALL '98
4 FLOORS 4 DJs, 7 UNIQUE ROOMS

The Ball '98 offers something for everyone: 

	GRAND BALLROOM:  For the Ball '98, Webster Hall's Grand 
Ballroom will be the site of the Main Party -- the place to meet 
and mingle with thousands of young Jewish singles, featuring 
dance music from a legendary DJ.  We will work to ensure that 
the atmosphere in the Grand Ballroom (and The Ball '98 generally)
is conducive to meeting and mingling.

	THE MARTINI BAR &amp; JAZZ CLUB:  Make this your place for 
intimate conversation.  

	TTHE TRAPEZE SHOW:  At 11:45 p.m., a trapeze artist defies 
death and gravity high above the Grand Ballroom -- without a net!  
Not for the faint-hearted.

	AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO EXPLORE:  The Coffee Bar, The 
Sports Bar, the Cigar Lounge, The Flashback Disco featuring music 
from the 70's and 80's, the Black Hole Lounge, and more!

	FOUR ENTRANCES, HUGE COAT CHECK:  So that you can quickly 
enter and enjoy the Nation's Largest Jewish Singles Event, we have 
made arrangements to use four entrances to Webster Hall and to 
expand Webster Hall's already large coat check.

         Admission to The Ball '98 is $20 in advance and $25 at the
