Comrades, comrades, please.

What makes "The Revolution" so powerful is the way it transends such petty
consideration as
"National Boundaries".

When our day comes there will be no treachery as there will be no "THEM" to
be treasonous to.  We
will be in total control.  There will be complete freedom of speech as long
as it doesn't cover topics
not suitable for public discorse (these will be desided as we need to).

Anyone can use encryption, as strong as they like.  Of course the only
computers will be centrally controlled and plain text backups will be
maintained for your peace of mind.  We will do all that tedious backing up
for you.

Anyone can own and carry any firearm.  Ammunition will naturally be
rationed.  We don't want the wealthy, bourgious &lt;sp&gt; to
gain an advantage over the brothers and sisters in the masses.

 Be patient comrades, our day will come.

What I *really* love about these "patriots" is how they are not _afraid_
to stand by their words!  Awwww, c'mon!  You're on the "Side Of
Right(tm)", so why hide?  You afraid I'm gonna piss on your white picket
fence?

Yours,

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
