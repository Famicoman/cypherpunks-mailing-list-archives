&gt;&gt;Of course, any manufacturer of Internet censorship proxy server software
&gt;&gt;could easily add ians.ml.org to their list of blocked sites (as they have
&gt;&gt;all already done with Anonymizer), so the idea would be for people to get
&gt;&gt;their friends to set up port-forwarding programs on computers that were not
&gt;&gt;blocked by the censoring proxy, and those could be set up to relay requests
&gt;&gt;between the IANS server and the computer behind the proxy server.
&gt;
&gt;It may not be so easy to get people to set up port-forwarding programs.
&gt;These could be a target for hackers seeking to cover their tracks as they
&gt;try break-ins.

The ports would only forward Web-based traffic, so an attack would have to
be carried out over HTTP.  The phf exploit is a notorious example; the IANS
was modified early to specifically prevent it from being used for phf
exploits.  But most other attacks cannot be done just with a Web browser as
far as I know.

One additional option would be to distribute port-forwarding programs that
keep logs of traffic.  The standard port-forwarding program for Windows
which we plan on recommending, Portpipe, does not do this, but we might
write our own version that does.

&gt;Also, how many people in this day of commercial ISPs are
&gt;able to set up port-forwarding programs?

Portpipe can be set up in thirty seconds on a Windows machine.  What you
need though is a machine that is connected more or less permanently to the
Internet.

&gt;It would seem more promising to make your web page script be simple
&gt;and portable enough that even users of AOL and free webpage hosts like
&gt;GeoCities would be able to install it.

The problem with having lots of people run a copy of IANS is not that it
couldn't be made easy to install, but in many cases it might not be even
possible to install.  Low-end Web page accounts do not allow the running of
CGI scripts on the Web server.

&gt;&gt;I am working on a JavaScript form that could be used on the client side to
&gt;&gt;solve this problem.  We would like to use DSA to encrypt the requests sent
&gt;&gt;using IANS, since I've heard DSA can be used for encryption without
&gt;&gt;royalties, unlike, for example, RSA.
[...]
&gt;What you want to do is to use the mathematical principle behind DSA, which
&gt;is the difficulty of solving the discrete log problem, and use an encryption
&gt;algorithm which relies on that same math problem, namely Diffie-Hellman or
&gt;ElGamal encryption.
[...]
&gt;If you need more information about what the various values mean, or how
&gt;to create a DSA and/or ElGamal key, just ask.

Thanks!  Some people had already pointed out to me that ElGamal would be an
ideal choice, and was probably what I had in mind when I was looking for "a
version of DSA that can be used for encryption".

I'll follow the outline of the ElGamal algorithm given at
	<A  HREF="http://www1.shore.net/~ws/Extras/Security-Notes/lectures/publickey.html">http://www1.shore.net/~ws/Extras/Security-Notes/lectures/publickey.html</A>

and the outline given in _Applied Cryptography_ unless you have another
recommendation.

&gt;Really, ElGamal is simple enough that if you have access to a large-number
&gt;math package, writing your own is probably easier than trying to get DSA
&gt;to do it.  It is unlikely that you will find a DSA implementation which
&gt;allows you to specify all the needed parameters above, particularly h
&gt;and k.  Usually h is forgotten after key generation and not used during
&gt;signature, and implementions will probably want to choose k themselves
&gt;since it is a very sensitive parameter.

I will probably have to write my own large-number package for JavaScript in
order to implement ElGamal.  You've given me enough to get started though,
thanks!  (If I have any more questions, I'll have to post them to the list
since you're using the re-mailer :-)  but maybe the list population will
find this interesting anyway.)
