&gt; From:    lauren@vortex.com (Lauren Weinstein; PRIVACY Forum Moderator)
&gt; Subject: Privacy Discussions Classified as a "Criminal Skill"
&gt; 
&gt; Greetings.  Is discussing privacy in the PRIVACY Forum a criminal skill?
&gt; According to one widely used commercial web filtering tool, the answer was
&gt; yes!  The controversy over software to block access to particular sites,
&gt; based on perceived content, has been continuing to rage.  Attempts to
&gt; mandate the use of such software in environments such as libraries and
&gt; schools have raised a variety of serious concerns.  In addition to fairly
&gt; straightforward freedom of speech issues, another factor revolves around
&gt; how accurate (or inaccurate) these filtering systems really are.  
&gt; 
&gt; I've now seen firsthand that errors by a filtering system can indeed be
&gt; quite
&gt; serious, an event that seems to certainly validate some of these concerns.
&gt; But there is something of a silver lining to the story, as we'll see
&gt; later.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently was contacted by someone at a large corporation, who was trying
&gt; to reach the PRIVACY Forum web site, which is constantly being referenced
&gt; by
&gt; individuals and commercial, educational, government, and other sites
&gt; around
&gt; the world.  This person was upset since whenever they attempted to reach
&gt; the <A  HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A> site and domain that hosts the PRIVACY Forum,
&gt; their web software blocked them, informing them that the block was in
&gt; place
&gt; due to the site being categorized as containing "criminal skills."  
&gt; 
&gt; As the webmaster for the vortex.com domain, this certainly came as news to
&gt; me.  The message they received didn't give additional information--they
&gt; didn't even know exactly where it came from.  It was apparent though, that
&gt; the entire organization was probably blocked from reaching the PRIVACY
&gt; Forum, since the filtering software in question was affecting a main
&gt; firewall system.
&gt; 
&gt; After a number of phone calls and discussions with the system
&gt; administrator
&gt; for that organization, the details began to emerge.  The company was
&gt; running
&gt; a filtering software package from Secure Computing Corporation of San
&gt; Jose,
&gt; California.  This package received weekly updates of blocked sites in a
&gt; wide
&gt; variety of categories, one of which was "criminal skills."  
&gt; 
&gt; The administrator had no idea what rationale was used for these decisions,
&gt; they just pulled in the list each week and applied it.  He immediately
&gt; placed
&gt; vortex.com on a local exception list so that it would no longer be blocked
&gt; to
&gt; their users.
&gt; 
&gt; I then turned my attention to Secure Computing.  After a number of calls,
&gt; I
&gt; found myself speaking with Ken Montgomery, director of corporate
&gt; communications for that firm.  He confirmed the information I had already
&gt; received.  The filtering product in question ("SmartFilter") was
&gt; apparently
&gt; not being marketed to individuals, rather, it was sold to institutions,
&gt; corporations, etc. to enforce filtering policies across entire entities.
&gt; The product covers a wide range of information categories that users of
&gt; the
&gt; software can choose to block.  He said that the majority of blocked sites
&gt; were in categories involving pornography, where there was (in his opinion)
&gt; no question of their not belonging there.  
&gt; 
&gt; The "criminal skills" category reportedly was broadly defined to cover
&gt; information that might be "of use" to criminals (e.g. how to build bombs).
&gt; He had no explanation as to why my domain had been placed in that list,
&gt; since by no stretch could any materials that are or have ever been
&gt; there fall into such a categorization.  He did discover that the
&gt; classification of my domain had occurred over a year ago (meaning
&gt; other sites could have been receiving similar blocking messages for
&gt; that period of time when trying to access the PRIVACY Forum) and
&gt; that the parties who had made the original classification were no longer
&gt; with their firm--so there was no way to ask them for their rationale.
&gt; (All of their classifications are apparently made by people, not
&gt; by an automated system.)
&gt; 
&gt; However, it seems likely that the mere mentioning of encryption may have
&gt; been enough to trigger the classification.  The administrator at the
&gt; organization that had originally contacted me about the blocked access,
&gt; told
&gt; me that the main reason they included the "criminal skills" category in
&gt; their site blocking list was to try prevent their users from downloading
&gt; "unapproved" encryption software.  This was a type of information that he
&gt; believed to be included under the Secure Computing "criminal skills"
&gt; category (the "logic" being, obviously, that since criminals can use
&gt; encryption to further their efforts, encryption is a criminal skill).  He
&gt; also admitted that he knew that their users could still easily obtain
&gt; whatever encryption software they wanted anyway, but he had to enforce the
&gt; company policy to include that category in their blocking list.
&gt; 
&gt; As PRIVACY Forum readers may know, no encryption software is or ever has
&gt; been distributed from here.  The topic of encryption issues does certainly
&gt; come up from time to time, as would be expected.  For the mere *mention*
&gt; of
&gt; encryption in a discussion forum to trigger such a negative categorization
&gt; would seem to suggest the fallacy of blindly trusting such classification
&gt; efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Montgomery of Secure Computing initially suggested that it was up to
&gt; their customers to decide which categories they wanted to use in their own
&gt; blocking lists--he also stated that as a company they were opposed to
&gt; mandatory filtering regulations.  I suggested that such determinations by
&gt; their customers were meaningless if the quality of the entries in those
&gt; categories could not be trusted and if errors of this severity could so
&gt; easily be made.  I felt that this was particularly true of a category with
&gt; an obviously derogatory nature such as "criminal skills"--the
&gt; ramifications
&gt; of being incorrectly placed into such a category, and then to not even
&gt; *know* about it for an extended period of time, could be extreme and very
&gt; serious.
&gt; 
&gt; To their credit, my argument apparently triggered a serious discussion
&gt; within Secure Computing about these issues.  I had numerous subsequent
&gt; e-mail and some additional phone contacts with Mr. Montgomery and others
&gt; in their firm concerning these matters.  First off, they apologized
&gt; for the miscategorization of vortex.com, and removed it from the
&gt; "criminal skills" category (it was apparently never listed in any
&gt; other of their categories).  
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, they have agreed with my concerns about the dangers of such
&gt; miscategorizations occurring without any mechanism being present for sites
&gt; to learn of such problems or having a way to deal with them.  So, they
&gt; will
&gt; shortly be announcing a web-based method for sites to interrogate the
&gt; Secure
&gt; Computing database to determine which categories (if any) they've been
&gt; listed under, and will provide a means for sites to complain if they feel
&gt; that they have been misclassified.  They've also suggested that their hope
&gt; is to provide a rapid turnaround on consideration of such complaints.
&gt; 
&gt; While by no means perfect, this is a step forward.  I would prefer a more
&gt; active notification system, where sites would be notified directly when
&gt; categorizations are made.  This would avoid their having to 
&gt; check to see whether or not they've been listed, and needing to keep
&gt; checking back to watch for any changes or new categorizations.  If more
&gt; filtering software companies adopt the Secure Computing approach, there
&gt; would be a lot of checking for sites to do if they wanted to stay on
&gt; top of these matters.  Secure Computing feels that such notifications are
&gt; not practical at this time.  However, their move to provide some
&gt; accountability to their filtering classifications is certainly preferable
&gt; to
&gt; the filtering systems which continue to provide no such facilities and
&gt; operate in a completely closed environment.
&gt; 
&gt; So, we make a little progress.  The PRIVACY Forum and vortex.com are no
&gt; longer miscategorized and have been removed from all Secure Computing
&gt; block
&gt; lists.  Secure Computing was polite and responsive in their
&gt; communications with me, and will establish the system discussed above in
&gt; reaction to my concerns.  Web filtering of course remains a highly
&gt; controversial topic with many serious negative aspects, but we see that
&gt; when
&gt; it comes to dealing with the complex issues involved, it would be a
&gt; mistake
&gt; to assume that all such filters all created equal.
