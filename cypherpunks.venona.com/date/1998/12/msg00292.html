&gt; From: ulf@fitug.de (Ulf =?iso-8859-1?Q?M=F6ller?=)

&gt; According to Jim Choate:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And this is different from yesterday how?
&gt; 
&gt; It is different in that it has been legal to distribute PGP and any
&gt; other public domain and mass market crypto software from Denmark
&gt; up to now.

Ah, so the call is for folks in Denmark to post the various pieces of
currently available software then, not everyone on the planet as it appears.

Don't think so.

He's asking that people put PGP and other available software on their
websites without the current export controls. If he's not then he's not
doing anything except blowing empty bugles because people are already doing
what he's asking for. In that situation he's after reputation capital,
personal gain.

&gt; &gt; Are you offering to put up your monies to provide any and all legal and
&gt; &gt; other support for any such site that participates? When is your site going
&gt; &gt; up?
&gt; 
&gt; John Gilmore's RSAREF site went up about a year ago. Your point being what?

Exactly what it states above. If you don't get it to bad.

RSAREF is not quite what he is asking folks to do now is it.

Bottem line, Gilmore is asking folks to run out and put their livelyhood and
their life at risk. What's he going to do for those who comply with his 
request?

Let me ask you this Ulf, when is YOUR site going up? When will YOU be the
first European repeater for the CDR? Your address implies you're in Denmark.
What are you going to do for YOUR liberty today? Has Gilmore agreed to
help fund YOUR fight of the change in your courts?

Bottem line, when will you get off your butt and put your neck in the noose
like many of the rest of us?

The reality is that the change in Denmark's law changes the global picture
very little.

Now when Denmark quites letting people IMPORT PGP *and* places like the US
quite letting people export it in some media (currently paper &amp; ink) then
you'll have cause to really be indignent.
