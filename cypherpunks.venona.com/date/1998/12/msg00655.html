&gt;    Digital Democracy: An Idea Whose Time Has Come News Posted by JonKatz
&gt;    on Friday December 18, @01:19PM
&gt;    from the We-Really-Don't-Have-To-Take-It-Anymore dept.
&gt;    As the Middle-Aged White Guys in Suits dig in in D.C. for what is
&gt;    hopefully their last stand, the idea of Digital Democracy never looked
&gt;    better. If it's a good idea (and it is) to empower individuals by
&gt;    teaching them how to master their own technology via movements like OS
&gt;    and free software, isn't it past time to use the technology of the Net
&gt;    and the Web to reverse the flow of power, away from the entrenched and
&gt;    increasingly lunatic journalists and politicians in Washington and
&gt;    back to the individuals staring from a distance in shock and horror
&gt;    and what they're seeing on their TV screens? Forget Wag the Dog.
&gt;    Joseph Conrad, Oliver Stone, Francis Ford Coppla (maybe Fellini, too)
&gt;    have seized the capitol. Only we can't leave the theater.
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    Never mind the silly allusions to "Wag the Dog." Somehow, Joseph
&gt;    Conrad, Oliver Stone and Francis Ford Coppola (maybe Fellini, too) got
&gt;    together to take over the government and play out their own visions of
&gt;    our political life. The American capitol is now the Heart of Darkness,
&gt;    fusing the darkest and most paranoid visions of "JFK" with the
&gt;    spectacularly represented lunacy of "Apocalypse Now."
&gt;    
&gt;    The movies have somehow become real life, but we can't leave the
&gt;    theater and go home. The horror never ends. Whenever we turn on the
&gt;    TV, they're all still there, shouting, posturing, spinning.
&gt;    
&gt;    More and more, it seems clear that they're never going to go away.
&gt;    Each one will have to be dragged out kicking and screaming, the last
&gt;    zealot in Congress, the last self-righteous reporter, the last
&gt;    screaming pundit on cable.
&gt;    
&gt;    It's time to start thinking about Digital Democracy. We have to be
&gt;    able to do better than them.
&gt;    
&gt;    If the goals of OS and the free software movement are, in part, the
&gt;    free and democratic sharing of technology, why not stretch the notion
&gt;    farther and put it into the context of our increasingly surreal, even
&gt;    mad, political times?
&gt;    
&gt;    The natural extension of the booming OS and free software movements
&gt;    are into politics and democracy, especially the radical new ways in
&gt;    which digital democracy could once again empower individuals instead
&gt;    of politicians and journalists, and reform the obviously broken and
&gt;    outdated way in which we resolve political issues.
&gt;    
&gt;    America was founded as a Republic, not really as a representative
&gt;    democracy. For one thing, Americans were scattered far from one
&gt;    another and couldn't make their feelings known quickly. So elected
&gt;    representatives were elected to gather and make decisions on their
&gt;    behalf.
&gt;    
&gt;    The authors of the Constitution didn't have all that much regard for
&gt;    the judgements of the average citizen, any more than their successors
&gt;    seem to. The structure was tilted towards a deliberative, rather than
&gt;    simply representative system so that educated and affluent landowners
&gt;    could screen the passions of the rabble and have the final say.
&gt;    
&gt;    The early pundits and cyber-gurus of the Internet's first generation
&gt;    spouted on quite a bit about the impact of networked computing on
&gt;    democratic institutions like Congress and journalism. These
&gt;    institutions, they predicted, would increasingly become ineffective
&gt;    and irrelevant, swept away by the power of digital technology to
&gt;    reverse the flow of power.
&gt;    
&gt;    This cyber-rhetoric seemed - was - heavy-handed, Utopian and
&gt;    overblown. It evoked the table-thumping Marxists more than the
&gt;    architects of a new, civil order. But this week, it looks more better
&gt;    by the hour.
&gt;    
&gt;    If you take the OS idea and daydream about it for a bit - millions of
&gt;    individuals taking control of their own technology and shaping the
&gt;    information they access and share, doesn't this idea have even greater
&gt;    application for politics? And could it possibly be more timely? If
&gt;    would could express ourselves politically - and have our expressions
&gt;    count - isn't it at least conceivable that the U.S. Congress might be
&gt;    talking about something that matters today, and for the last year?
&gt;    
&gt;    Digital democracy is no longer a pipedream, not in the year of the
&gt;    online dumping of the Starr report and the impeachment proceedings.
&gt;    It's no longer difficult to imagine every American having a computer
&gt;    in the next few years, or having easy access to one in schools,
&gt;    libraries and public buildings. People could vote online now as easily
&gt;    as they vote by ballot or booth - more easily really. Each citizen
&gt;    could be assigned a digital voting number and use it to vote from home
&gt;    or the school or library down the road, where computers already exist
&gt;    or could easily be set up. Fraud would be easier to spot and guard
&gt;    against, thanks to advances in both encryption and programming. And
&gt;    this wouldn't even raise fresh privacy issues, as voters have to
&gt;    register now.
&gt;    
&gt;    This week, the country is confronted with the bizarre spectacle of a
&gt;    runaway political entity - Republicans in the House of Representatives
&gt;    - deciding, correctly or not, that no interest is more important than
&gt;    impeaching President Clinton - not public sentiment, military action,
&gt;    education, health care, the economy or any other civic or social
&gt;    agenda. Even if they're right, lots of people are uneasy about this
&gt;    willful disregard of public will. Most Americans don't want this to be
&gt;    happening, and have said so for months. The politicians have said that
&gt;    it doesn't really matter, the next election is two years away. By
&gt;    then, nobody will remember this strange time. That's a good argument
&gt;    for some form of Digital Democracy.
&gt;    
&gt;    Digital voting made possible by the Internet would make a spectacle
&gt;    like the impeachment proceedings impossible. Everything shouldn't
&gt;    necessarily be subject to popular vote, but the impeachment of the
&gt;    President should be, and the Net and the Web could make it possible
&gt;    even now.
&gt;    
&gt;    Watching music lovers challenge the primacy of the music industry
&gt;    through digital technology like MP3's and the Rio raises the question
&gt;    of whether we really need a middleman institution like Congress to
&gt;    decide issues like this for us. After the year long Lewinsky/Clinton
&gt;    media barrage and the dumping of reams of material, pornographic and
&gt;    otherwise on the Internet, we know as much about the charges against
&gt;    the President as they do. We are able and equipped to make up our own
&gt;    minds and express our own wishes. And perhaps even see our wishes
&gt;    carried out.
&gt;    
&gt;    Do we need to be bound to completely by their agenda, when we can now
&gt;    set our own?
&gt;    
&gt;    Unlike Colonial Americans, we aren't disconnected and remote. We can
&gt;    make our feelings known instantly. We have the technology to gather in
&gt;    communities and clusters to debate and consider as much or more
&gt;    information as members of Congress.
&gt;    
&gt;    Many politicians and journalists have feared, even loathed, the
&gt;    Internet, since its inception. Increasingly, it becomes clear why. It
&gt;    really does threaten them. It really does provide the means to take
&gt;    power away from them - and their co-produced spectacles like
&gt;    impeachment proceedings and presidential nominating processes - and
&gt;    distribute it more broadly. This week marks the perfect time to begin
&gt;    consider the possibilities of Digital Democracy. To broaden the notion
&gt;    of empowering individuals begin by the designers of the Internet,
&gt;    advanced by hackers, geeks, nerds, developers and designers and being
&gt;    played out on sites like this one today. From the moment the Internet
&gt;    began to grow, power and information began to leach away from
&gt;    entrenched institutions like government, the press and academe and
&gt;    towards hundreds of thousands, then millions of individual citizens.
&gt;    The impeachment proceedings are a powerful argument for the idea that
&gt;    it's time to take that idea farther.
&gt;    
&gt;    Digital technology doesn't mean that democratic decisions would have
&gt;    to be rushed or impulsive. They could be as deliberative as we wished.
&gt;    Digital voting could be spread over time, perhaps requiring several
&gt;    votes. A broad range of issues and decisions - appointments, foreign
&gt;    policy decisions, criminal matters - would be inappropriate for online
&gt;    voting.
&gt;    
&gt;    But the Net is becoming a medium already well set-up for civic
&gt;    discussions. The Internet could host hundreds, even thousands of
&gt;    public online forums for debate and discussion - via message boards,
&gt;    chat rooms and websites that could be designed for towns, counties,
&gt;    states or regions. Politicians, agencies and advocates could
&gt;    disseminate information and arguments via national websites, mailing
&gt;    lists and e-mail.
&gt;    
&gt;    These forums would have to consider new kinds of rules for debate and
&gt;    discussion, an online issue long in need of attention. Posters would
&gt;    have to identify themselves and take responsibility for their words.
&gt;    Discussion would center on issues, not personalities. Presidents and
&gt;    legislators could bring information and decisions directly to the
&gt;    American public. If the Starr report was worthy of being dumped on
&gt;    line, why not the House Judiciary report on impeachment? Voters could
&gt;    read it online, debate it, decide to pass it along for further action
&gt;    or stop the process right there.
&gt;    
&gt;    If digital democracy were in place, this issue would have been
&gt;    resolved nearly a year ago. Tens of millions of dollars would have
&gt;    been better spent. Many more important issues would have considered,
&gt;    accepted and rejected. Clinton would either be doing his job or long
&gt;    gone. Instead of feeling cheated and ignored, the public would feel
&gt;    enfranchised and involved. Democracy wouldn't be a remote circus
&gt;    practiced far away by alien cultures, but something as close as a desk
&gt;    or living room.
&gt;    
&gt;    We are no longer a country of merchants and mostly illiterate farmers.
&gt;    Paine and Jefferson, the fathers of media, couldn't quite have
&gt;    imagined the Internet, but there seems little doubt that they have
&gt;    loved its communicative and democratic possibilities. Those of us with
&gt;    access to computers and modems have access to all of the information
&gt;    and opinions in the world, thus the means to consider issues and
&gt;    express ourselves. In fact, there are thousands of people who've been
&gt;    online for years and who are experienced at creating digital
&gt;    communities, monitoring conversations and developing the software and
&gt;    hardware to run them efficiently and accurately.
&gt;    
&gt;    No system involving Digital Democracy could work or even be seriously
&gt;    considered until and unless all Americans were guaranteed access to
&gt;    computers. A few years ago, online users were a tiny, techno-elite.
&gt;    That's no longer true. Computers are increasingly ubiquitous, at
&gt;    schools, businesses, and at home. Personal computers are already being
&gt;    mass-marketed that cost well below $1,000, and public agencies like
&gt;    schools, libraries and municipal office buildings are increasingly
&gt;    wired. They could offer online voting to non-computer users in much
&gt;    the way they offer voting booths and make them available. Many more
&gt;    Americans own computers than voting booths.
