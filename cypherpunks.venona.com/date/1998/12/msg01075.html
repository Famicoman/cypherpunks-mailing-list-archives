bulletin board on the Games Web Page for dates on matches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FREE Software/FTP Web Site

Connect FREE has become a mirror site for TUCOWS, which will be available
very shortly.

What is TUCOWS?
TUCOWS is the UK premier FTP web site for FREE PC Internet software, and
because Connect FREE users will be able to connect direct to the server at
Connect FREE, bypassing the Internet, meaning downloads will be a lot faster
then you have ever seen before. The site is also updated on a daily basis, so
the latest upgrades are always available. Software available to download
includes Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mail packages, FTP software, News hosts.

You name it, we got it, and it is all for FREE!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Premium Rate Telephone Technical Support

Connect Free has launched it's Premium Rate technical support line on 0890
900 0050, sorry but all calls are charged at 50p per minute. The reason for
charging 50p per minute is because the Internet connection is
free and we need to cover our overheads and staffing cost for the technical
support lines, however we are cheaper than most of our competitors. E-mail
technical support is still available, obviously this is only useful when
you can connect to the Internet. (Please ensure you include you Login ID
with any communication)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On-line Technical Support

If you can connect to the Internet it might be worth while checking out
www.connectfree.net/help
Connect FREE has designed a very comprehensive technical support web page,
which covers a vast amount of topics. Ranging from how to connect and
configure Mail, FTP, IRC, CHAT and Browser software to how to design a Web
Site and there is some useful tips on solving problems (Well worth a LOOK)

Support for MS Windows 3.11 95/98 NT, Apple Mac, and Linux

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The New Connect FREE Portal

Connect FREE are proud to announce the launch of the Connect Free Portal
site in association with 2b.
A Fantastic site for up-to date News, Weather, Lottery Results, Shopping,
Entertainment, Sports and Music.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeServe

For all those users out there, who have signed up with FreeServe and would
prefer to have the option of which ISP you dial into or maybe have several
connections to different ISP’s. FreeServe have now decided to offer anyone
with a FreeServe connection the ability to uninstall your FreeServe software.

Check out <A  HREF="http://www.freeserve.net/support/cserve_uninstall.htm">http://www.freeserve.net/support/cserve_uninstall.htm</A>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxy Server:

We are still receiving calls on our help line regarding Proxy server
settings. Connect FREE does not currently have a Proxy Server, and if your
software is configured to look for one then you will go nowhere. If you find
that you can connect to our servers without a problem but then find that
when you launch your browser you cannot access any web pages or performance
is very slow, then you probably have the Proxy Server setting enabled. To
Disable (Win95/98): Control Panel, Internet, and Connection, Un-tick the
Proxy Server settings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SantaCalls

Wouldn't your child, grandchild, godchild, nephew or niece just love a
personal call from Santa this Christmas?

In association with the Variety Club we are asking our users to visit their
Santa Calls Web site. The idea is that mums and dads can enter the details
of their children i.e. names of pets and things they would like for
Christmas etc and then Santa actually phones the child and has a chat. The
kiddie is totally convinced because Santa is armed with all their details -
and who knows little Johnny might just clean that hamster out a bit more
often when he knows Santa is watching! Visit Santa Calls at
<A  HREF="http://www.santacalls.org/">http://www.santacalls.org/</A>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements

Connect Free would like to hear from you, if youhave any suggestions on how
we may improve our service, or adding more content to the Connect Free web
site.

It is Connect Free policy not to send unwanted rubbish by e-mail or junk
advertising by any other means. All we ask is that you receive our monthly
newsletter informing you of any changes to the service and any new service
that may come available which you may benefit from.
