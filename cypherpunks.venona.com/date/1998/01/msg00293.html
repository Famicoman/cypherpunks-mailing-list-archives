Hi,

Below is the 3rd preface to Darwin's 'Species', in it he clearly gives
credit to Wallace as a co-discover of evolutionary theory. Even to the point
of co-presenting the work to the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858. 

Oh, Erazmus Darwin was Charles' grandfather not uncle. Sorry for any
confusion.

&gt;    The Origin of Species
&gt;    Preface to the Third Edition
&gt;    by Charles Darwin
&gt;    
&gt;    I will here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on the
&gt;    Origin of Species. Until recently the great majority of naturalists
&gt;    believed that species were immutable productions, and had been
&gt;    separately created. This view has been ably maintained by many
&gt;    authors. Some few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that
&gt;    species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are
&gt;    the descendants by true generation of pre-existing forms. Passing over
&gt;    allusions to the subject in the classical writers,(1) the first author
&gt;    who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.
&gt;    But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he
&gt;    does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of
&gt;    species, I need not here enter on details.
&gt;    
&gt;    Lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited
&gt;    much attention. This justly-celebrated naturalist first published his
&gt;    views in 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his "Philosophie
&gt;    Zoologique,' and subsequently, in 1815, in the Introduction to his
&gt;    "Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vertébres.' In these works he upholds the
&gt;    doctrine that species, including man, are descended from other
&gt;    species. He first did the eminent service of arousing attention to the
&gt;    probability of all change in the organic, as well as in the inorganic
&gt;    world, being the result of law, and not of miraculous interposition.
&gt;    Lamarck seems to have been chiefly led to his conclusion on the
&gt;    gradual change of species, by the difficulty of distinguishing species
&gt;    and varieties, by the almost perfect gradation of forms in certain
&gt;    groups, and by the analogy of domestic productions. With respect to
&gt;    the means of modification, he attributed something to the direct
&gt;    action of the physical conditions of life, something to the crossing
&gt;    of already existing forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the
&gt;    effects of habit. To this latter agency he seemed to attribute all the
&gt;    beautiful adaptations in nature; -- such as the long neck of the
&gt;    giraffe for browsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise
&gt;    believed in a law of progressive development; and as all the forms of
&gt;    life thus tend to progress, in order to account for the existence at
&gt;    the present day of simple productions, he maintains that such forms
&gt;    are now spontaneously generated.(2)
&gt;    
&gt;    Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his 'Life,' written by his
&gt;    son, suspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are
&gt;    various degenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he
&gt;    published his conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated
&gt;    since the origin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly
&gt;    on the conditions of life, or the 'monde ambiant' as the cause of
&gt;    change. He was cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe
&gt;    that existing species are now undergoing modification; and, as his son
&gt;    adds, "C'est donc un problème à réserver entièrement à l'avenir,
&gt;    supposé meme que l'avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.'
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1813, Dr W. C. Wells read before the Royal Society 'An Account of a
&gt;    White female, part of whose skin resembled that of a Negro'; but his
&gt;    paper was not published until his famous 'Two Essays upon Dew and
&gt;    Single Vision' appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly
&gt;    recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first
&gt;    recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to the
&gt;    races of man, and to certain characters alone. After remarking that
&gt;    negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical
&gt;    diseases, he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some
&gt;    degree, and, secondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated
&gt;    animals by selection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this
&gt;    latter case 'by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more
&gt;    slowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted
&gt;    for the country which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of
&gt;    man, which would occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants
&gt;    of the middle regions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than
&gt;    the others to bear the diseases of the country. This race would
&gt;    consequently multiply, while the others would decrease; not only from
&gt;    their inability to sustain the attacks of disease, but from their
&gt;    incapacity of contending with their more vigorous neighbours. The
&gt;    colour of this vigorous race I take for granted, from what has been
&gt;    already said, would be dark. But the same disposition to form
&gt;    varieties still existing, a darker and a darker race would in the
&gt;    course of time occur: and as the darkest would be the best fitted for
&gt;    the climate, this would at length become the most prevalent; if not
&gt;    the only race, in the particular country in which it had originated.'
&gt;    He then extends these same views to the white inhabitants of colder
&gt;    climates. I am indebted to Mr Rowley, of the United States, for having
&gt;    called my attention, through Mr Brace, to the above passage in Dr
&gt;    Wells' work.
&gt;    
&gt;    The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterwards Dean of Manchester, in the
&gt;    fourth volume of the 'Horticultural Transactions,' 1822, and in his
&gt;    work on the 'Amaryllidaceae' (1837, pp. 19, 339), declares that
&gt;    'horticultural experiments have established, beyond the possibility of
&gt;    refutation, that botanical species are only a higher and more
&gt;    permanent class of varieties.' He extends the same view to animals.
&gt;    The Dean believes that single species of each genus were created in an
&gt;    originally highly plastic condition, and that these have produced,
&gt;    chiefly by intercrossing, but likewise by variation, all our existing
&gt;    species.
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1826 Professor Grant, in the concluding paragraph in his well-known
&gt;    paper ('Edinburgh philosophical journal,' vol. xiv. p. 283) on the
&gt;    Spongilla, clearly declares his belief that species are descended from
&gt;    other species, and that they become improved in the course of
&gt;    modification. This same view was given in his 55th Lecture, published
&gt;    in the 'Lancet' in 1834.
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1831 Mr Patrick Matthew published his work on 'Naval Timber and
&gt;    Arboriculture,' in which he gives precisely the same view on the
&gt;    origin of species as that (presently to be alluded to) propounded by
&gt;    Mr Wallace and myself in the 'Linnean journal,' and as that enlarged
&gt;    in the present volume. Unfortunately the view was given by Mr Matthew
&gt;    very briefly in scattered passages in an Appendix to a work on a
&gt;    different subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr Matthew
&gt;    himself drew attention to it in the 'Gardener's Chronicle,' on April
&gt;    7th, 1860. The differences of Mr Matthew's view from mine are not of
&gt;    much importance; he seems to consider that the world was nearly
&gt;    depopulated at successive periods, and then re-stocked; and he gives
&gt;    as an alternative, that new forms may be generated ' without the
&gt;    presence of any mould or germ of former aggregates.' I am not sure
&gt;    that I understand some passages; but it seems that he attributes much
&gt;    influence to the direct action of the conditions of life. He clearly
&gt;    saw, however, the full force of the principle of natural selection.
&gt;    
&gt;    The celebrated geologist and naturalist, Von Buch, in his excellent
&gt;    'Description physique des Isles Canaries' (1836, p. 147), clearly
&gt;    expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into
&gt;    permanent species, which are no longer capable of intercrossing.
&gt;    
&gt;    Rafinesque, in his 'New Flora of North America,' published in 1836,
&gt;    wrote (p. 6) as follows:- 'All species might have been varieties once,
&gt;    and many varieties are gradually becoming species by assuming constant
&gt;    and peculiar characters'; but farther on (p. 18) he adds, 'except the
&gt;    original types or ancestors of the genus.'
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1843-44 Professor Haldeman ('Boston journal of Nat. Hist. U.
&gt;    States, vol. iv. p. 468) has ably given the arguments for and against
&gt;    the hypothesis of the development and modification of species: he
&gt;    seems to lean towards the side of change.
&gt;    
&gt;    The 'Vestiges of Creation' appeared in 1844. In the tenth and much
&gt;    improved edition (1853) the anonymous author says (p. 155):- 'The
&gt;    proposition determined on after much consideration is, that the
&gt;    several series of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to
&gt;    the highest and most recent, are, under the providence of God, the
&gt;    results, first, of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of
&gt;    life, advancing them, in definite times, by generation, through grades
&gt;    of organisation terminating in the highest dicotyledons- and
&gt;    vertebrata, these grades being few in number, and generally marked by
&gt;    intervals of organic character, which we find to be a practical
&gt;    difficulty in ascertaining affinities; second, of another impulse
&gt;    connected with the vital forces, tending, in the course of
&gt;    generations, to modify organic structures in accordance with external
&gt;    circumstances, as food, the nature of the habitat, and the meteoric
&gt;    agencies, these being the ''adaptations'' of the natural theologian.'
&gt;    The author apparently believes that organisation progresses by sudden
&gt;    leaps, but that the effects produced by the conditions of life are
&gt;    gradual. He argues with much force on general grounds that species are
&gt;    not immutable productions. But I cannot see how the two supposed
&gt;    'impulses' account in a scientific sense for the numerous and
&gt;    beautiful co-adaptations which we see throughout nature; I cannot see
&gt;    that we thus gain any insight how, for instance, a woodpecker has
&gt;    become adapted to its peculiar habits of Life. The work, from its
&gt;    powerful and brilliant style, though displaying in the earlier
&gt;    editions little accurate knowledge and a great want of scientific
&gt;    caution, immediately had a very wide circulation. In my opinion it has
&gt;    done excellent service in this country in calling attention to the
&gt;    subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for
&gt;    the reception of analogous views.
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1846 the veteran geologist N. J. d'Omalius d'Halloy published in an
&gt;    excellent though short paper ("Bulletins de l'Acad. Roy Bruxelles,'
&gt;    tom. xiii. p. 581) his opinion that it is more probable that new
&gt;    species have been produced by descent with modification than that they
&gt;    have been separately created: the author first promulgated this
&gt;    opinion in 1831.
&gt;    
&gt;    Professor Owen, in 1849 ('Nature of Limbs,' p. 86), wrote as follows:-
&gt;    "The archetypal idea was manifested in the flesh under diverse such
&gt;    modifications, upon this planet, long prior to the existence of those
&gt;    animal species that actually exemplify it. To what natural laws or
&gt;    secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such
&gt;    organic phenomena may have been committed, we, as yet, are ignorant.'
&gt;    In his Address to the British Association, in 1858, he speaks (p. li.)
&gt;    of "the axiom of the continuous operation of creative power, or of the
&gt;    ordained becoming of living things.' Farther on (p. xc.), after
&gt;    referring to geographical distribution, he adds, 'These phenomena
&gt;    shake our confidence in the conclusion that the Apteryx of New Zealand
&gt;    and the Red Grouse of England were distinct creations in and for those
&gt;    islands respectively. Always, also, it may be well to bear in mind
&gt;    that by the word ''creation'' the zoologist means '"a process he knows
&gt;    not what.'' He amplifies this idea by adding that when such cases as
&gt;    that of the Red Grouse are enumerated by the zoologists as evidence of
&gt;    distinct creation of the bird in and for such islands, he chiefly
&gt;    expresses that he knows not how the Red Grouse came to be there, and
&gt;    there exclusively; signifying also, by this mode of expressing such
&gt;    ignorance, his belief that both the bird and the islands owed their
&gt;    origin to a great first Creative Cause.' If we interpret these
&gt;    sentences given in the same Address, one by the other, it appears that
&gt;    this eminent philosopher felt in 1858 his confidence shaken that the
&gt;    Apteryx and the Red Grouse first appeared in their respective homes,
&gt;    'he knew not how,' or by some process 'he knew not what.'
&gt;    
&gt;    This Address was delivered after the papers by Mr Wallace and myself
&gt;    on the Origin of Species, presently to be referred to, had been read
&gt;    before the Linnean Society. When the first edition of this work was
&gt;    published, I was so completely deceived, as were many others, by such
&gt;    expressions as 'the continuous operation of creative power,' that I
&gt;    included Professor Owen with other palaeontologists as being firmly
&gt;    convinced of the immutability of species; but it appears ('Anat. of
&gt;    Vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 796) that this was on my part a
&gt;    preposterous error. In the last edition of this work I inferred, and
&gt;    the inference still seems to me perfectly just, from a passage
&gt;    beginning with the words 'no doubt the type-form,' &amp;c. (Ibid. vol. i.
&gt;    p. xxxv.), that Professor Owen admitted that natural selection may
&gt;    have done something in the formation of a new species; but this it
&gt;    appears (Ibid. vol. nl. p. 798) is inaccurate and without evidence. I
&gt;    also gave some extracts from a correspondence between Professor Owen
&gt;    and the Editor of the 'London Review,' from which it appeared manifest
&gt;    to the Editor as well as to myself, that Professor Owen claimed to
&gt;    have promulgated the theory of natural selection before I had done so;
&gt;    and I expressed my surprise and satisfaction at this announcement; but
&gt;    as far as it is possible to understand certain recently published
&gt;    passages (Ibid. vol. iii. p. 798) I have either partially or wholly
&gt;    again fallen into error. It is consolatory to me that others find
&gt;    Professor Owen's controversial writings as difficult to understand and
&gt;    to reconcile with each other, as I do. As far as the mere enunciation
&gt;    of the principle of natural selection is concerned, it is quite
&gt;    immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded me, for both of us,
&gt;    as shown in this historical sketch, were long ago preceded by Dr Wells
&gt;    and Mr Matthews.
&gt;    
&gt;    M. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in his lectures delivered in 1850
&gt;    (of which a Résumé appeared in the 'Revue et Nag. de Zoolog.,' Jan.
&gt;    1851), briefly gives his reason for believing that specific characters
&gt;    "sont fixés, pour chaque espèce, tant qu'elle se perpétue au milieu
&gt;    des mèmes circonstances: ils se modifient, si les circonstances
&gt;    ambiantes viennent à changer.' 'En résumé, l'observation des animaux
&gt;    sauvages démontre déjà la variabilité limité des espèces. Les
&gt;    expériences sur les animaux sauvages devenus domestiques, et sur les
&gt;    animaux domestiques redevenus sauvages, la démontrent plus clairement
&gt;    encore. Ces memes expériences prouvent, de plus, que les différences
&gt;    produites peuvent etre de valeur générique.' In his 'Hist. Nat.
&gt;    Généralé (tom. ii. p. 430, 1859) he amplifies analogous conclusions.
&gt;    
&gt;    From a circular lately issued it appears that Dr Freke, in 1851
&gt;    ("Dublin Medical Press,' p. 322), propounded the doctrine that all
&gt;    organic beings have descended from one primordial form. His grounds of
&gt;    belief and treatment of the subject are wholly different from mine;
&gt;    but as Dr Freke has now (1861) published his Essay on the 'Origin of
&gt;    Species by means of Organic Affinity,' the difficult attempt to give
&gt;    any idea of his views would be superfluous on my part.
&gt;    
&gt;    Mr Herbert Spencer, in an Essay (originally published in the 'Leader,'
&gt;    March, 1852, and republished in his 'Essays,' in 1858), has contrasted
&gt;    the theories of the Creation and the Development of organic beings
&gt;    with remarkable skill and force. He argues from the analogy of
&gt;    domestic productions, from the changes which the embryos of many
&gt;    species undergo, from the difficulty of distinguishing species and
&gt;    varieties, and from the principle of general gradation, that species
&gt;    have been modified; and he attributes the modification to the change
&gt;    of circumstances. The author (1855) has also treated psychology on the
&gt;    principle of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and
&gt;    capacity by gradation.
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1852 M. Naudin, a distinguished botanist, expressly stated, in an
&gt;    admirable paper on the Origin of Species ('Revue Horticole, p. 102;
&gt;    since partly republished in the 'Nouvelles Archives du Muséum,' tom.
&gt;    i. p. 171), his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner
&gt;    as varieties are under cultivation; and the latter process he
&gt;    attributes to man's power of selection. But he does not show how
&gt;    selection acts under nature. He believes, like Dean Herbert, that
&gt;    species, when nascent, were more plastic than at present. He lays
&gt;    weight on what he calls the principle of finality, 'puissance
&gt;    mystérieuse, indéterminée; fatalité pour les uns; pour les autres
&gt;    volonté providentielle, dont l'action incessante sur les ètres vivants
&gt;    détermine, à toutes les époques de l'existence du monde, la forme, le
&gt;    volume, et la durée de chacun d'eux, en raison de sa destinée dans
&gt;    l'ordre de choses dont il fait partie. C'est cette puissance qui
&gt;    harmonise chaque membre à l'ensemble, en l'appropriant à la fonction
&gt;    qu'il doit remplir dans l'organisme général de la nature, fonction qui
&gt;    est pour lui sa raison d'ètre.'(3)
&gt;    
&gt;    In 1853 a celebrated geologist, Count Keyserling ("Bulletin de la Soc.
&gt;    Gèolog.,' 2nd Ser., tom. x. p. 357), suggested that as new diseases,
&gt;    supposed to have been caused by some miasma, have arisen and spread
&gt;    over the world, so at certain periods the germs of existing species
&gt;    may have been chemically affected by circumambient molecules of a
&gt;    particular nature, and thus have given rise to new forms.
&gt;    
&gt;    In this same year, 1853, Dr Schaaffhausen published an excellent
&gt;    pamphlet ('Verhand. des Naturhist. Vereins der preuss. Rheinlands,'
&gt;    &amp;c.), in which he maintains the development of organic forms on the
&gt;    earth. He infers that many species have kept true for long periods,
&gt;    whereas a few have become modified. The distinction of species he
&gt;    explains by the destruction of intermediate graduated forms. 'Thus
&gt;    living plants and animals are not separated from the extinct by new
&gt;    creations, but are to be regarded as their descendants through
&gt;    continued reproduction.'
&gt;    
&gt;    A well-known French botanist, M. Lecoq, writes in 1854 ('Etudes sur
&gt;    Géograph. Bot.,' tom. i. p. 250), 'On voit que nos recherches sur la
&gt;    fixité ou la variation de l'espèce, nous conduisent directement aux
&gt;    idées émises, par deux hommes justement célèbres, Geoffroy
&gt;    Saint-Hilaire et Goethe.' Some other passages scattered through M.
&gt;    Lecoq's large work, make it a little doubtful how far he extends his
&gt;    views on the modification of species.
&gt;    
&gt;    The 'Philosophy of Creation' has been treated in a masterly manner by
&gt;    the Rev. Baden Powell, in his "Essays on the Unity of Worlds,' 1855.
&gt;    Nothing can be more striking than the manner in which he shows that
&gt;    the introduction of new species is "a regular, not a casual
&gt;    phenomenon,' or, as Sir John Herschel expresses it, 'a natural in
&gt;    contradistinction to a miraculous, process.'
&gt;    
&gt;    The third volume of the "Journal of the Linnean Society' contains
&gt;    papers, read July 1st, 1858, by Mr Wallace and myself, in which, as
&gt;    stated in the introductory remarks to this volume, the theory of
&gt;    Natural Selection is promulgated by Mr Wallace with admirable force
&gt;    and clearness.
&gt;    
&gt;    Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect,
&gt;    expressed about the year 1859 (see Prof. Rudolph Wagner, a
&gt;    "Zoologisch-Anthropologische Untersuchungen,' 1861, s. 51) his
&gt;    conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution,
&gt;    that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single
&gt;    parent-form.
&gt;    
&gt;    In June, 1859, Professor Huxley gave a lecture before the Royal
&gt;    Institution on the 'Persistent Types of Animal Life.' Referring to
&gt;    such cases, he remarks, "It is difficult to comprehend the meaning of
&gt;    such facts as these, if we suppose that each species of animal and
&gt;    plant, or each great type of organisation, was formed and placed upon
&gt;    the surface of the globe at long intervals by a distinct act of
&gt;    creative power; and it is well to recollect that such an assumption is
&gt;    as unsupported by tradition or revelation as it is opposed to the
&gt;    general analogy of nature. If, on the other hand, we view 'Persistent
&gt;    Types' in relation to that hypothesis which supposes the species
&gt;    living at any time to be the result of the gradual modification of
&gt;    pre-existing species a hypothesis which, though unproven, and sadly
&gt;    damaged by some of its supporters, is yet the only one to which
&gt;    physiology lends any countenance; their existence would seem to show
&gt;    that the amount of modification which living beings have undergone
&gt;    during geological time is but very small in relation to the whole
&gt;    series of changes which they have suffered.'
&gt;    
&gt;    In December, 1859, Dr Hooker published his 'Introduction to the
&gt;    Australian Flora.' In the first part of this great work he admits the
&gt;    truth of the descent and modification of species, and supports this
&gt;    doctrine by many original observations.
&gt;    
&gt;    The first edition of this work was published on November 24th, 1859,
&gt;    and the second edition on January 7th, 1860.
&gt;    
&gt;    Footnotes
&gt;    
&gt;    (1) Aristotle, in his 'Physicae Auscultationes' (lib. 2, cap. 8, s.
&gt;    2), after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn
&gt;    grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer's corn when threshed
&gt;    out of doors, applies the same argument to organization: and adds (as
&gt;    translated by Mr Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to
&gt;    me), 'So what hinders the different parts [of the body] from having
&gt;    this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,
&gt;    grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the
&gt;    grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they
&gt;    were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.
&gt;    And in like manner as to the other parts in which there appears to
&gt;    exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things
&gt;    together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they
&gt;    were made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been
&gt;    appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity, and whatsoever
&gt;    things were not thus constituted, perished, and still perish. We here
&gt;    see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little
&gt;    Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on
&gt;    the formation of the teeth.
&gt;    
&gt;    (2) I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from
&gt;    Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's ('Hist. Nat. Générale,' tom. ii. p.
&gt;    405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work
&gt;    a full account is given of Buffon's conclusions on the same subject.
&gt;    It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr Erasmus Darwin,
&gt;    anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in
&gt;    his 'Zoonomia' (vol. i. pp. 500-510), published in 1794. According to
&gt;    Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme partisan
&gt;    of similar views, as shown in the Introduction to a work written in
&gt;    1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterwards: he has
&gt;    pointedly remarked ('Goethe als Naturforscher,' von Dr Karl Medinge s.
&gt;    34) that the future question for naturalists will be how, for
&gt;    instance, cattle got their horns, and not for what they are used. It
&gt;    is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views
&gt;    arise at about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr Darwin in
&gt;    England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in
&gt;    France; came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the
&gt;    years 1794-5.
&gt;    
&gt;    (3) From references in Bronn's 'Untersuchungen über die
&gt;    Entwickenlungs-Gesetze,' it appears that the celebrated botanist and
&gt;    palaeontologist Unger published, in 1852, his belief that species
&gt;    undergo development and modification. Dalton, likewise, in Pander and
&gt;    Dalton's work on Fossil Sloths, expressed, in 1821 a similar belief.
&gt;    Similar views have, as is well known, been maintained by Oken in his
&gt;    mystical 'Natur-philosophie.' From other references in Godron's work
&gt;    'Sur l'Espéce,' it seems that Bory St Vincent, Burdach, Poiret, and
&gt;    Fries, have all admitted that new species are continually being
&gt;    produced.
&gt;    
&gt;    I may add, that of the thirty-four authors named in this Historical
&gt;    Sketch, who believe in the modification of species, or at least
&gt;    disbelieve in separate acts of creation, twenty-seven have written on
&gt;    special branches of natural history or geology.
