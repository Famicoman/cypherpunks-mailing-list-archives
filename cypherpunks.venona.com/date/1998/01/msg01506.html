now!

THE MARKETS

You're probably aware that deregulation of the $215 Billion Dollar
electricity market begins in 1998. Remember what happened when
long-distance deregulated? Companies like MCI and Sprint made billions
and became household names in a market 1/3 the size of electricity! And
electricity is only the tip of the iceberg.

An international powerhouse doing in excess of $1.5 Billion annually is
aggressively seeking entrepreneurs to participate in its launch into the
following markets:

	Electricity
	Internet Access

	International Phone Service

	Paging
	Cable and Satellite Television
	Natural Gas
	Home Security Systems

We are offering you the opportunity to turn these expenxe centers into
profit centers and participate in the largest transfer of wealth in
history. IMAGINE GETTING PAID EVERY TIME SOMEONE GETS ON THE NET, BUYS
SOMETHING OFF THE NET, TURNS ON THE LIGHT, COOKS, MAKES A TELEPHONE
CALL, USES A CELLULAR OR PAGER, WATCHES CABLE OR SATELLITE TV OR USES A
HOME SECURITY SYSTEM! Recurring, ongoing income paid on services we all
use everyday already, except you can now earn a royalty on other
people's usage. You can also receive royalties on the usage of
businesses, large corporations, apartment buildings...anywhere these
services are used.
