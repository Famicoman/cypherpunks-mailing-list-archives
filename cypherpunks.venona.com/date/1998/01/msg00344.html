I thought I'd share these quote...

The one quote that I found really funny is the one where Einstein says that
had he known he would have been a locksmith. At some point after he came to
the US somebody asked him what he would have been if he hadn't taken up
physics. His reply was a plumber. He was promptly made an honorary member of
the national plumbers union.

&gt;    "It is best, it seems to me, to separate one's inner striving from
&gt;    one's trade as far as possible. It is not good when one's daily break

&gt;    "He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned
&gt;    my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, scince for
&gt;    him the spinal cord would fully suffice. This disgrace to civilization
&gt;    should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless
&gt;    brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all
&gt;    this, how despiceable an ignoreable war is; I would rather be torn to
&gt;    shreds than be a part of so base an action! It is my conviction that
&gt;    killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder." --

&gt;    Albert Einstein, when asked to describe radio, replied:
&gt;    "You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull
&gt;    his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you
&gt;    understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send
&gt;    signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that
&gt;    there is no cat."

&gt;    "Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities.

&gt;    
&gt;    Through the release of atomic energy, our generation has brought into
&gt;    the world the most revolutionary force since prehistoric man's
&gt;    discovery of fire. This basic force of the universe cannot be fitted
&gt;    into the outmoded concept of narrow nationalisms.
&gt;    For there is no secret and there is no defense; there is no
&gt;    possibility of control except through the aroused understanding and
&gt;    insistence of the peoples of the world. We scientists recognise our
&gt;    inescapable responsibility to carry to our fellow citizens an
&gt;    understanding of atomic energy and its implication for society. In
&gt;    this lies our only security and our only hope - we believe that an
&gt;    informed citizenry will act for life and not for death.
&gt;    A. Einstein, 1947 d.C.
