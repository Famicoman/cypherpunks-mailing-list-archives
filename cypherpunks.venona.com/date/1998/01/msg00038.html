Hello all,

&gt;&gt; "Swisscom has stored data on the movements of more than a million mobile
&gt;&gt; phone users. It can call up the location of all its mobile subscribers down
&gt;&gt; to a few hundred meters and going back at least half a year," the paper
&gt;&gt; reported.
&gt;
&gt;They probably say a few hundred meters so the people don't feel
&gt;their privacy is too ridiculously invaded / soften the blow.
&gt;
&gt;If this is a GSM network then I think they can probably pinpoint
&gt;your location down to 2 possible locations within a few meters
&gt;due to the digital timing involved with the very precise spread
&gt;spectrum radio. Or maybe your actual location within a meter or 2.
&gt;
&gt;I have heard of digital mobile phones that have a feature in their test/diag
&gt;mode that displays the distance to the current base station in meters,
&gt;and also displays info of a second base station that it would most likely
&gt;switch to when moving out of the current cell.
&gt;Even if the telco only had the distance info to your phone within a meter
&gt;from 2 of their base stations, they could calculate where you are if need
&gt;be to 2 possible locations within meters.
&gt;Surely though they would have the capability of recording distance info
&gt;from 3 base stations, pin pointing you exactly during a call or the exact
&gt;spot your phone requested a cell change.
&gt;
&gt;And during a call, if need be, they could probably plot your position at
&gt;around 10,000 samples per second.	:) Though for them to be keeping
&gt;this much info on you, you are obviously being investigated.
&gt;
&gt;Isn't it ironic that people who use GSM for it's "security" can have this
&gt;much info of their whereabouts known to big brother/whoever?
&gt;Not to mention their actual conversation.
&gt;
&gt;Imagine Mr.Drug Dealer turns up to court and watches as the jury is
&gt;presented with a floorplan on screen and an animated pinpoint of his
&gt;phones position while a recording of his conversation is played in sync?
&gt;
&gt;The world just about, has no idea!
&gt;To say big brother is watching is a gross understatement.	:)
&gt;
&gt;He's gunna find out who's naughty and nice.
&gt;
&gt;Bye for now.
