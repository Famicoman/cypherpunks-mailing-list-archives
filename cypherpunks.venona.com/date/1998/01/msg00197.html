&gt;Declan,
&gt; Here's the story from Comm Daily, Dec. 17
&gt;
&gt;'Optimistic and Damned Silly'
&gt;
&gt;     INTERNET CHANGE FOCUS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
&gt;
&gt;     Law enforcement officials of U.S. and 7 other industrialized
&gt;countries want to make fundamental changes in Internet technology
&gt;in order to aid in their ability to track and catch criminals,
&gt;Justice Dept. sources said.
&gt;
&gt;     Program to consider changes in Internet architectures comes as
&gt;part of agreement announced last week by Attorney Gen. Janet Reno
&gt;and Justice ministers from around world after meeting in Washington
&gt;(CD Dec 11 p10).  However, one leading Internet authority, MCI
&gt;Senior Vp Vinton Cerf, said international group's plan wouldn't
&gt;work.
&gt;
&gt;     Justice ministers are considering approach similar to that of
&gt;Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) program in
&gt;U.S., which would make traffic from advanced telecom networks more
&gt;accessible to law enforcement entities.  Representatives of Canada,
&gt;France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and U.K., as well as U.S.,
&gt;agreed as part of "statement of principles" issued in communique
&gt;following 2-day session that:  "To the extent practicable,
&gt;information and telecommunications systems should be designed to
&gt;help prevent and detect network abuse, and should also facilitate
&gt;the tracing of criminals and the collection of evidence."  Several
&gt;items on "action plan" issued in support of those principles refer
&gt;to working with new technologies to collect critical evidence,
&gt;developing standards for authenticating electronic data for use in
&gt;investigations and encouraging standards-making bodies to provide
&gt;public and private sectors "with standards for reliable and secure
&gt;telecommunications and data processing technologies."
&gt;
&gt;     DoJ officials said Dept. may want to talk later with telephone
&gt;industry on trap and trace issues, but it's premature to involve
&gt;them now in follow-up to international summit.  Instead, they said,
&gt;they are looking at broader picture of telecom networks that
&gt;haven't worked as closely with law enforcement as they could, and
&gt;have begun thinking about Internet protocols.  Internet operates
&gt;globally with common protocols, currently Internet Protocol version
&gt;4.  Internet engineers are working on next iteration, version IPv6
&gt;(Internet Protocol version 6 -- 5 was experimental attempt that was
&gt;dropped).  Justice official said that one problem now is that it's
&gt;easy to send and receive e-mail with false address, called
&gt;"spoofing."
&gt;
&gt;     It would be helpful to law enforcement if information sent
&gt;over Internet were tagged, and packets would transmit information
&gt;reliably as to where they came from, including user and service
&gt;provider, officials said.  Loose analogy would be to compare e-mail
&gt;messages to tagging of explosives, so law enforcement can track
&gt;explosive material to its source.  DoJ said new protocols could be
&gt;designed to make it easier to authenticate messages and to make
&gt;system more reliable.  Law enforcement wants to work with industry
&gt;to accomplish goal, saying it would help "keep people who are
&gt;abusing information technologies from continuing to do it."
&gt;
&gt;     There will be substantial obstacles to law enforcement
&gt;concept, however.  Not least of them is that IPv6 will include
&gt;sophisticated encryption capabilities as part of protocols.  Such
&gt;security isn't built in to Internet now, one of reasons why
&gt;electronic commerce has yet to take off, said Mark McFadden,
&gt;communications dir. for Commercial Internet eXchange Assn. (CIX).
&gt;That feature will make it harder for law enforcement to gain access
&gt;to information, he said.
&gt;
&gt;     Cerf, co-inventor of Internet protocols, said in interview
&gt;that law enforcement's concept of tagging e-mail messages wouldn't
&gt;work:  "To imagine that we would instantly create the
&gt;infrastructure for that throughout the entire Internet strikes me
&gt;as optimistic and damned silly, at least in the short term.  Anyone
&gt;who anticipates using tools to guarantee that everything will be
&gt;traceable is not going to have a successful outcome."  Technically,
&gt;such project could be accomplished, Cerf said, but having
&gt;administrative infrastructure to administer it is quite different
&gt;issue.
&gt;
&gt;     It's possible to have digital signature for every packet of
&gt;data, but it would take "an enormous amount of processing, and it's
&gt;not clear we have any network computers and routers that could do
&gt;that and maintain the traffic flow that's required," Cerf said.  It
&gt;also would require that each sender affix digital signature to each
&gt;piece of mail, idea that Cerf said couldn't be enforced:  "Frankly,
&gt;the idea of trying to guarantee traceability of that kind is far
&gt;from implementable."  He said he didn't want to be misunderstood
&gt;that his objections were "an argument in favor of criminality."
&gt;But Cerf said he worries that "someone relies on what they think is
&gt;a technical solution without recognizing all of the administrative
&gt;mechanics that need to be put in place."
&gt;
&gt;     Law enforcement has some time to work with Internet community.
&gt;McFadden said IPv6 isn't scheduled to be implemented at consumer
&gt;level for at least 5 years, possibly as much as 10.  There was some
&gt;urgency when it appeared that reservoir of Internet addresses would
&gt;dry up, but with progress being made to protect addresses as scarce
&gt;resource there's less pressure for new set of protocols, he said.
