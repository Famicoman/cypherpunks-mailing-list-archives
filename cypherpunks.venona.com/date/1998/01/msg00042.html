&gt;                  DRUNKEN DRIVER ORDERED CLOSER TO LIQUOR STORE
&gt;                                        
&gt;      graphic January 2, 1998
&gt;      Web posted at: 8:39 p.m. EST (0139 GMT)
&gt;      
&gt;      CINCINNATI (Reuters) -- An Ohio judge has ordered a chronic drunken
&gt;      driver to move within easy walking distance of a liquor store or
&gt;      face jail.
&gt;      
&gt;      In a sentence meted out on New Year's Eve, Hillsboro Municipal Judge
&gt;      James Hapner ordered Dennis Cayse to move within "easy walking
&gt;      distance" -- defined as one-half mile or less -- of a liquor store
&gt;      within 30 days or face a potential 1-1/2-year jail sentence for
&gt;      drunken driving.
&gt;      
&gt;      It was Cayse's 18th conviction for drunken driving. He was also
&gt;      sentenced to spend the first week of each of the next five years in
&gt;      jail.
&gt;      
&gt;      The judge also directed that Cayse, who lost his license years ago
&gt;      but continued to drink and drive, be handcuffed to the
&gt;      passenger-side door or be seated with someone between him and the
&gt;      driver anytime he travels.
&gt;      
&gt;      University of Cincinnati law professor Christo Lassiter said the
&gt;      multiple sentence passed constitutional muster.
&gt;      
&gt;      "It appears to me that this sentence is neither unconstitutional nor
&gt;      inappropriate," Lassiter told Reuters Friday. "It looks to me like
&gt;      the judge felt that there was nothing he could do to keep the man
&gt;      off the road except to make him move to where he could walk to buy
&gt;      his booze."
&gt;      
&gt;      Hillsboro is a town of 6,000 just east of Cincinnati.
&gt;      
&gt;      "For as long as I have been associated with law enforcement, I have
&gt;      never heard of such an unusual sentence. It's very squirrelly," said
&gt;      Lt. Ronald Ward of the Highland County sheriff's office.
&gt;      
&gt;      "I have known Dennis Cayse a long time and I've never seen him sober
&gt;      except when he was in jail," Ward said. "His lifetime record shows
&gt;      that if he is not in jail, he's going to drink and drive."
&gt;      
&gt;      A spokeswoman for Mothers Against Drunk Driving denounced the
&gt;      sentence, saying it was too lenient and sends the wrong public
&gt;      message.
