&gt;&gt;hi all,....i am wondering if there is a way to monitor police MDT's
&gt;&gt;(mobile display terminals)
&gt;&gt;i have the frq. that they use but i dont know how to hook up a scanner to
&gt;&gt;p/c. any thoughts would be appreciated thank you
&gt;
&gt;Since no one else seemed to respond to this, I guess I will...first off
&gt;M.D.T. stands for (Mobile Data Terminals), I got this posting off some
&gt;group I can't really remeber where from, but it is informative, and was
&gt;the
&gt;subject of a Feb, '97 "911Dispatcher Magazine" story. It should answer all
&gt;of your questions, I also have a list of some places where you can buy the
&gt;unit pre-made, or a kit to make your own. I have left the Source code out
&gt;on purpose as it is rather lengthy, if you want it I can send it to you.

&gt;&gt;From lord@heaven.com Mon Dec 23 23:11:43 EST 1996
&gt;Article: 44420 of alt.radio.scanner
&gt;Subject: MDT stuff
&gt;
&gt;Greetings one and all,
&gt;
&gt;Have you ever lusted to decode Mobile Data Terminal (MDT)
&gt;tranmissions? Have you ever wanted to see the same NCIC and motor
&gt;vehicle information that law enforcement officers see? Have you ever
&gt;wanted to see what officers send to each other over "private" channels?
&gt;And all this with an interface you can build with only a few dollars
&gt;worth of parts from your local radio shack?
&gt;
&gt;If so this posting might be your rendevous with destiny. The tail
&gt;end of this posting includes the source code of a program that decodes
&gt;and displays MDT messages. It stores roughly 30k of messages in a buffer
&gt;and then writes the whole buffer to a file called "data.dat" before
&gt;terminating. The program may be interrupted at any time by pressing any
&gt;key (don't use control-c) at which point it writes the partially filled
&gt;buffer to "data.dat". This program only works for systems built by
&gt;Motorola using the MDC4800 tranmission protocol. This accounts for a
&gt;large fraction of public service MDT systems as well other private
&gt;systems.
&gt;
&gt;The existence of this program is ample evidence that Motorola has
&gt;misrepresented its MDT systems when it marketed them as a secure means
&gt;of communcications. The interested reader will soon discover that these
&gt;systems do not use any form of encryption. Security concerns instead
&gt;have been dealt with by using a code. "And what might this code be
&gt;called?" asks the reader. The code turns out to be plain ASCII. What
&gt;follows is a brief description of how the program and the MDC4800
&gt;protocol work. If you don't understand something go to your local
&gt;library and check out a telecommunications theory book.
&gt;
&gt;1. The raw transmission rate is 4800 baud. The program's interrupt
&gt;service routine simply keeps track of the time between transitions. If
&gt;you're receiving a perfect signal this will be some multiple of 1/4800
&gt;seconds which would then give you how many bits were high or low. Since
&gt;this is not the best of all possible worlds the program instead does the
&gt;following: transitions are used to synchronize a bit clock. One only
&gt;samples whenever this clock is in the middle of the bit to produce the
&gt;raw data stream. This greatly reduces jitter effects.
&gt;
&gt;2. Whenever a tranmitter keys up the MDC4800 protocol calls for bit
&gt;synchronization (a sequence of 1010101010101010....). In the program
&gt;this will result in receive bit clock synchronization. There is no need
&gt;to specifically look for the bit sync.
&gt;
&gt;3. Look for frame synchronization in raw bit stream so that data
&gt;frames can be broken apart. Frame synchronization consists of a 40 bit
&gt;sequence : 0000011100001001001010100100010001101111. If this sequence is
&gt;detected (or 35 out of 40 bits match up in the program) the system is
&gt;idling and the next 112 bit data block is ignored by the program. If the
&gt;inverted frame sync is detected one immediately knows that 112 bit data
&gt;blocks will follow.
&gt;
&gt;4. Receive the 112 bit data block and undo the bit interleave. This
&gt;means that one must reorder the bits in the following sequence : {0,16,
&gt;32,48,64,80,96,1,17,33,49,65,81,97,2,18,34,...} if the orignal sequence
&gt;were received as {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...}.
&gt;
&gt;5. Check the convolutional error correcting code and count the
&gt;number of errors. The error correcting code is rate 1/2 which means we
&gt;will be left with 56 data bytes. The encoder is constructed so that the
&gt;output consists of the original data bits interspersed with error
&gt;correcting code. The generating polynomial used is :
&gt;1 + X^-1 + X^-5 + X^-6
&gt;Whenever an error is detected a counter is incremented. An attempt is
&gt;made to correct some errors by finding the syndrome and looking for the
&gt;bogus bit.
&gt;
&gt;6. Keep receiving 112 bit data blocks until either a new frame sync
&gt;is found or two consecutive data blocks have an unacceptably large
&gt;number of errors.
&gt;
&gt;7. Each data block consists of six data bytes; the last 8 bits are
&gt;status bits that are simply ignored. The program shows the data in two
&gt;columns - hexadecimal and ASCII. This data is kept in a buffer and is
&gt;written to the file "data.dat" when the program terminates.
&gt;
&gt;8. What the program doesn't do: As a further check on the data
&gt;there can be CRC checks. This varies from protocol to protocol so this
&gt;program does not implement the CRC checks. Nonetheless, it is a
&gt;relatively trivial matter to find the generating polynomial. The
&gt;addresses, block counts, and message ID numbers are also quite easy to
&gt;deduce.
&gt;
&gt;As you can see, there is no encryption. The bit interleave and the error
&gt;correcting coding are there solely to insure the integrity of the ASCII
&gt;data. Since any moron could have figured this stuff out from scratch one
&gt;could argue that MDTs do not use "...modulation parameters intentionally
&gt;witheld from the public". Therefore the Electronic Communications
&gt;Privacy Act may not prohibit receiving MDT tranmissions. However,
&gt;consult your attorney to make sure.
&gt;
&gt;The total disregard for security will no doubt annoy countless
&gt;Motorola customers who were assured that their MDT systems were secure.
&gt;Since Federal law states that NCIC information must be encrypted your
&gt;local law enforcement agency might be forced to spend millions of
&gt;dollars to upgrade to a secure MDT system - much to the delight of
&gt;Motorola and its stockholders. Cynics might conclude that the release of
&gt;a program like this is timed to coincide with the market saturation of
&gt;existing MDT systems.
&gt;
&gt;Also, this program is completely free and it had better stay that
&gt;way. What's to prevent you from adapting this into a kit and selling it
&gt;&gt;from classified ads in the back of Nuts and Volts? Nothing. But take a
&gt;look at Motorola's patents sometime. You'll notice that this program
&gt;does things that are covered by a shitload of patents. So any attempt to
&gt;take financial advantage of this situtation will result in utter misery.
&gt;
&gt;Please keep the following in mind: this program only works with the
&gt;first serial port (COM1). If your mouse or modem is there too bad. If
&gt;you don't like this rewrite the program.
&gt;
&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;What equipment do I need?
&gt;
&gt;RADIO SCANNER:
&gt;
&gt;A scanner that can receive 850-869 MHz. For those of you who don't
&gt;know, this is the band where most business and public service trunked
&gt;radio systems can be found along with the mobile data terminal
&gt;transmissions. Chances are excellent that if your local authorities have
&gt;a motorola trunked radio system and mobile data terminals that this is
&gt;the frequency band in use. Very rarely will one find mobile data
&gt;terminals in other frequency bands.
&gt;
&gt;Now for the fun part - your scanner should probably be modified to
&gt;allow you to tap off directly from the discriminator output. If you wait
&gt;until the signal has gone through the radio's internal audio filtering
&gt;the waveform will likely be too heavily distorted to be decoded. This is
&gt;exactly the same problem that our friends who like to decode pager
&gt;transmissions run into - some of them have claimed they can only decode
&gt;512 baud pager messages using the earphone output of their scanner.
&gt;These mobile data terminal messages are 4800 baud so I don't think you
&gt;have a snowball's chance in hell without using the discriminator output.
&gt;If you don't know where to begin modifying your scanner you might want
&gt;to ask those who monitor pagers how to get the discriminator output for
&gt;your particular radio.
&gt;
&gt;COMPUTER/SCANNER INTERFACE
&gt;
&gt;Those of you who have already built your interface for decoding
&gt;pager messages should be able to use that interface without any further
&gt;ado. For those starting from scratch - you might want to check out
&gt;packages intended for pager decoding such as PD203 and the interfaces
&gt;they describe. The following excerpt gives an example of a decoder that
&gt;should work just fine (lifted out of the PD203 POCSAG pager decoder
&gt;shareware documentation):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 0.1 uF |\ +12v
&gt;&gt; ---||-----------------------|- \|
&gt;&gt; AF IN | |741 \
&gt;&gt; ---- | | /--------------------- Data Out
&gt;&gt; | \ ------|+ /| | CTS (pin 5/8)
&gt;&gt; | / 100K | |/-12v | or DSR (pin 6/6)
&gt;&gt; | \ | |
&gt;&gt; GND / ----/\/\/\---- GND ------ GND (pin 7/5)
&gt;&gt; | | 100K
&gt;&gt; | \ N.B. Pin Numbers for com port are
&gt;&gt; GND / given as x/y, where x is for a 25
&gt;&gt; \ 10K way, y for a 9 way.
&gt;&gt; /
&gt;&gt; |
&gt;&gt; GND
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The above circuit is a Schmitt Trigger, having thresholds of about +/-
&gt;1v.
&gt;&gt; If such a large threshold is not required, eg for a discriminator
&gt;output,
&gt;&gt; then the level of positive feedback may be reduced by either reducing
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; value of the 10K resistor or by increasing the value of the 100K
&gt;feedback
&gt;&gt; resistor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The +/- 12v for the op-amp can be derived from unused signals on the COM
&gt;&gt; port (gives more like +/- 10v but works fine !):-
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; TxD (2/3) --------------|&lt;-------------------------------------- -12v
&gt;&gt; | |
&gt;&gt; RTS (4/7) --------------|&lt;-------- GND - -
&gt;&gt; | | _ + 10uF
&gt;&gt; ---------&gt;|------- - - |
&gt;&gt; Diodes 1N4148 | - + 10uF GND
&gt;&gt; | |
&gt;&gt; DTR (20/4) -------------&gt;|-------------------------------------- +12v
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If I were building this circuit I would strongly suggest tying the
&gt;non-inverting (+) input of the op-amp to ground since you are working
&gt;directly with the discriminator output and don't need a Schmitt trigger.
&gt;All these parts or equivalents are easily available (even at your local
&gt;Radio Shack which stocks the finest collection of components that have
&gt;failed the manufacturer's quality control checks and supported by a
&gt;sales staff that's always got the wrong answers to your questions).
&gt;
&gt;Also: DO NOT use the RI (ring indicator) as an input to the computer.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;How do I check things?
&gt;
&gt;As a first step, I would get a package such as PD203 and use it to
&gt;decode a few pages. If you can get that working you know that that your
&gt;interface circuit is functioning correctly.
&gt;
&gt;If you are in a reasonably sized town you might be part of the
&gt;ardis network. The ardis network is a nationwide commercial mobile data
&gt;terminal network where one can send/receive E-mail messages from one's
&gt;portable computer. It has been exclusively assigned the frequency of
&gt;855.8375 MHz. Therefore, if you can hear digital bursts on this
&gt;frequency you are basically guarranteed that these are MDC4800 type
&gt;messages. You should be able to get stuff popping up on your screen
&gt;although a lot of the messages will not be plain english.
&gt;
&gt;If your interface works but you can't seem to get any messages on
&gt;the screen for a channel you know is a Motorola MDT system then it might
&gt;be possible that your scanner/interface is putting out data with the
&gt;polarity reversed. To check for this run the program with a command line
&gt;arguement. When it runs you should an initial "Polarity reversed"
&gt;message and hopefully then things will work out for you.
&gt;
&gt;Other than that: if this program doesn't work pester someone else
&gt;who has got it working. Don't bother pestering the author(s) of this
&gt;posting; the shit(s) aka "she/he/it (s)" are afraid of a thousand
&gt;lawyers from Motorola descending like fleas to infest their pubic hair
&gt;and accordingly have decided to remain forever anonymous. No doubt
&gt;someone on the usenet who sees this post will know what to do with this
&gt;program and also hopefully rewrite into a more user friendly form. When
&gt;you do please don't forget to release the source code.
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Future projects/nightmares you might want to think about:
&gt;
&gt;Certain MDT systems embed formatting information in the text in the
&gt;form of ESC plus [ plus a few more bytes. Someone might want to decode
&gt;these on the fly and format the output so it looks exactly the same way
&gt;as the user sees it.
&gt;
&gt;Make it so that this program works with com ports other than COM1.
&gt;
&gt;Make it user friendly?
&gt;
&gt;Enlarge the data buffer from the current 30k.
&gt;
&gt;Give the output data file an unique name each time the program is
&gt;run instead of "data.dat".
&gt;
&gt;How about sorting through the past traffic so that you only see
&gt;traffic to a specified user?
&gt;
&gt;The program does not cut data blocks off in the display but it
&gt;might add an extra one or two (which will display as all zeroes).
&gt;Someone might want to make all those zeroes be shown as blanks instead.
&gt;
&gt;Write some real instructions.
&gt;
&gt;Now the more ambitous stuff:
&gt;
&gt;Are you half-way competent with RF engineering? Then listen in to
&gt;the tranmissions from the mobile units back to the base station. That
&gt;way you get everyone's password and user IDs as they log on to the MDT
&gt;system. By this point you will no doubt have been able to figure out all
&gt;of the appropriate communications protocols so you should think about
&gt;getting your own transmitter up and running along with the necessary
&gt;program modifications so that you can transmit MDT messages. The
&gt;required transmitter can be very simple - for example, those masocists
&gt;who want to start from scratch might want to special order an
&gt;appropriate crystal (pulling the frequency with the computer's tranmit
&gt;signal), building a frequency multiplier chain, and adding a one watt RF
&gt;amplifier to top it all off (see the appropriate ARRL publications for
&gt;more information on radio techniques). Now you can log in and look at
&gt;the criminal records and motor vehicle information on anybody you can
&gt;think of. Find out what your neigbors are hiding. Find out who that
&gt;asshole was that cut you off downtown. Find out where your former
&gt;girl/boy friend is trying to hide from you. And on and on...
&gt;Those with simpler tastes might want to simply transmit at the base
&gt;station's frequency to any nearby MDT terminal - now you too can
&gt;dispatch your local law enforcement agencies at the touch of your
&gt;fingers!!! See your tax dollars at work tearing apart every seam of your
&gt;neighbor's house. Or create strife and dissension in your local law
&gt;enforcement agency as more and more officers come out of the closet
&gt;using their MDTs trying to pick up fellow officers.
&gt;
&gt;There are municipalities that have put GPS receivers on all of
&gt;their vehicles. Should it happen that the information is sent back over
&gt;one of these networks you could have your computer give you a real-time
&gt;map showing the position of every vehicle and how far away they are from
&gt;you.
&gt;
&gt;Extend your knowledge to other data networks. Here you will want to
&gt;look at the RAM mobile data network. It uses the MOBITEX protocol which
&gt;is really easy to find information on. Since it is an 8 kilobaud GMSK
&gt;signal there is a decent chance that you can use the interface described
&gt;here. This transmission mode demmands much more from your equipment than
&gt;MDT tranmissions. At the very least you must be much more careful to
&gt;make sure you have adequate low frequency response. Despite this it is
&gt;possible to receive and decode MOBITEX transmissions with a simple
&gt;op-amp circuit! This just goes to show you what drivelling bullshit
&gt;RAM's homepage is filled with - they explain in great detail how hackers
&gt;will never be able to intercept user's radio tranmissions (incidentally
&gt;explaining how to decode their tranmissions). The necessary program will
&gt;be the proverbial exercise left for the reader. For better performance
&gt;buy a dedicated MOBITEX modem chip and hook it up to your computer.
&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;A few words about the program:
&gt;
&gt;Remember - you must have your decoder hooked up to COM1. The RTS
&gt;line will be positive and the DTR line negative but if you built the
&gt;decoder with a bridge rectifier you really don't have to worry about
&gt;their polarity. Stop the program by punching any key; don't use
&gt;control-c or control-break!
&gt;
&gt;If you must reverse polarity run the program with any command line
&gt;arguement (example: type in "mdt x" at the command line if your program
&gt;is mdt.exe). You should then see the "Polarity Reversed." message pop up
&gt;and hopefully things will then work.
&gt;
&gt;As far as compiling this - save the latter portion of this posting
&gt;(the program listing) and feed it to a C compiler. Pretty much any C
&gt;compiler from Borland should work. If you (Heaven Forbid) use a
&gt;Microsoft C compiler you might need to rename some calls such as
&gt;outport. Follow any special instructions for programs using their own
&gt;interrupt service routines. This program is not object oriented. It also
&gt;does not want anything whatsoever to do with Windows. Please don't even
&gt;think about running this program under Windows. Finally, here it is:
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck and may God be with ya

&gt;Subject: More real spy stuff...
&gt;
&gt;Germany smuggled agent out of Russia
&gt;
&gt;Germany's Federal Intelligence Agency smuggled one of its Russian
&gt;agents to safety while Russian President Boris Yeltsin and German
&gt;Chancellor Helmut Kohl were meeting in Moscow last Nov., the weekly
&gt;news magazine Focus said Monday. The BND had received a tip that a
&gt;long-serving Russian agent was threatened and launched a cloak and
&gt;dagger operation Nov. 29 to pull the agent out of Russia. The agent,
&gt;a 32-year-old Army captain from the Russian town Samara with the code
&gt;name "Coastal Fog," had given BND Russian military communications
&gt;secrets for years. The rescue operation took place as Kohl and
&gt;Yeltsin sat down for talks.
&gt;
&gt;Russian spies still fighting the Cold War in Britain
&gt;
&gt;Security sources say Moscow is as eager as ever to uncover
&gt;defence secrets But now it is acting  more for economic than
&gt;militaristic reasons. Security sources put Russian military
&gt;espionage in Britain at the same level as it was in the 1980s.
&gt;In a radio broadcast in December, President Yeltsin,
&gt;speaking about Russia's intelligence aims, said:
&gt;"Notwithstanding positive changes after the end of the
&gt;Cold War, tough competition is still underway in the
&gt;world. Competition for new technology and geo-political
&gt;influence is increasing."
&gt;
&gt;Space Imagery Overhaul Aims at Better Data and Easier Access
&gt;
&gt;The shuttle flight is part of a massive modernization of the
&gt;multibillion-dollar U.S. intelligence collection program. The goal
&gt;is to compile a comprehensive view of the world from
&gt;overhead -- using the shuttle, satellites, spy planes and missiles
&gt;-- and to consolidate the data in a single computerized system
&gt;accessible to civilian and military officials across the
&gt;government.
&gt;
&gt;A CIA Target at Home in America
&gt;By DANIEL C. TSANG
&gt;Los Angeles Times January 18, 1998
&gt;
&gt;Because of me, the Central Intelligence Agency has had to concede it does 
&gt;spy on Americans. Just last month, the agency had to remove a denial
&gt;posted 
&gt;on its Web site that it doesn't do this. For it kept a file on me
&gt;throughout the 1980s and '90s--despite a law against political spying on
&gt;Americans. 
&gt;Just before Christmas, the CIA revised its Web site. The new version says 
&gt;the CIA can keep files on Americans if they are suspected of espionage or
&gt;international terrorism. But I am no spy or terrorist. The CIA conceded as 
&gt;much by settling my lawsuit, paying my lawyers some $46,000 and promising
&gt;to expunge my file and never spy on my political activities in the
&gt;future.
