&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You must find the advertising business completely mystifying, then.
&gt; 
&gt; Not at all. I even manage to use it well enough to make money selling my
&gt; own services now and again...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You pay to have your data disseminated in a form that you can be later
&gt; &gt; paid -- for example, leave the juciest part of the data in encrypted
&gt; &gt; form, along with a public key through which payment options can be
&gt; &gt; negotiated. 
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly, which means we are left with two results. Either the source forgoes
&gt; the d-h completely, since they could dissiminate their data through a normal
&gt; anon remailer and usenet (for example) completely eliminating the whole
&gt; point of the d-h and the consequential payments - this reduces their
&gt; overhead considerably. Or they share the income through the d-h operator.
&gt; Now if the source has two halves of a clue to rub together their share will
&gt; include whatever money they paid the d-h operator in the first place - thus
&gt; eliminating the need for the source to have paid in the first place. Either
&gt; way the source ends up with the net effect they don't pay the d-h operator
&gt; for their services - the end user does. In only one case is there a economic
&gt; reason for the d-h to exist. Now if the goal of a d-h operator is to make
&gt; some income which model would you choose? From the source's perspective the
&gt; d-h model makes sense because it places two (not one) layer of anonymity
&gt; between them and Mallet. As a source, which model would you choose?
&gt; 
&gt; Either way you look at it, the end result is the end user pays the bills.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why on earth do you try to be an ISP, then?
&gt; 
&gt; Why on earth are you assuming that is what I do? While I have sold dedicated
&gt; and intermittent dial-ups they in general have not been to the general
&gt; public and my customer base is not one that comes from general advertising.
&gt; At no point has it ever been a significant portion of my income in any case.
&gt; As a matter of fact I haven't advertised in any public forums. Don't know
&gt; where you get your data about me from but you really should go to the horses
&gt; mouth instead of some jackass. Your data would be much more accurate.

Actually, the only data I have is your comments on CP over the past
year or so.
