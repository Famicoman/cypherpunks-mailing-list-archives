 At your request, we recently sent you our International
 Shopping Mall Complex banner rates for your business.
 
 The following is an update on categories available, and
 several other new options available to fit your expansion plans
 and budget. Please take a look and see what would work best for you.
 We do have a 25% off special introductory offer on our Mini-
 Mirror Store Program, details below.

 PLUS HERE IS SOME EXCITING NEWS..a cutting edge option to be
 offered shortly to our clients. 
 Right now, we are working on adding a program to the Malls 
 that will enable ONLINE PURCHASES TO BE CHARGED TO THE CUSTOMERS' 
 TELEPHONE  BILL. This presents unlimited possibilities for 
 impulse buying, no forms, just click a button...

 Right now, it can be used for items like downloading software,
 and electronic reports and books...But Here is the Big News..it will
 soon be able to work for hard goods!!..Just think about the 
 opportunities here. We will be sending out a full report
 on this in the next week or two in our Client Newsletter.

 Another option available is an item that we can add to your mall
 stores which has proven very successful in increasing sales for any 
 business. We would be glad to send you more information on this,
 just check box below. This has worked well for wholesale, retail,
 manufacturing and is so simple, you will wonder why you haven't
 thought of it before!

 Established in 1994, our award-winning International Shopping
 Complex avgs 1.5 million hits a month in our four
 Mall locations with approx. 300 stores from 29 countries. 
 
 As the Web gets more and more congested, you know that attracting
 qualified buyers to your site gets even more challenging!
 
 You will get tremendous exposure in four shopping locations.
 You could not get a more targeted audience for your products.
 These visitors only come to the Malls to see the shops and are 
 specifically looking in the listed categories for retail, 
 wholesale/mfg or industrial offers.

 The advantages to having four store locations is huge. You will
 get four new URL's to post on all the search engines, and we
 also give you a site address where you can enter each url once only
 and it will automatically send it to 100 directories/search engines,
 giving you 400 new listings right off the bat, (no charge).

 A business that has four or five separate locations definitely 
 establishes you as a serious business. This is the concept
 used by the offline shopping malls that spread from coast to
 coast - new brand names were established and became household
 words.

 What some of our storeowners have accomplished:
 
 One storeowner, after just over a year, grew to 5-figure Internet
 sales, another doubled their sales in just one month, another's
 business grew to over 70% international, an industrial client
 reports great response and sales, wholesalers and mfg. are getting
 distribution for their product lines, another storeowner has built
 a tremendous catalog mail order business, one store introduced a new
 product which started selling the first weekend online...

 Here is what another happy customer wrote last week, on renewing for
 another year with us:
 "You have a great system and it really helps me. You are a valuable and
 indispensable facet of my business."
