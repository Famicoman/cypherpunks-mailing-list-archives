       QUANTUM COMPUTATION: A TUTORIAL COOL CENTRAL SITE OF THE HOUR

  Abstract:
  
   Imagine a computer whose memory is exponentially larger than its
   apparent physical size; a computer that can manipulate an exponential
   set of inputs simultaneously; a computer that computes in the twilight
   zone of Hilbert space. You would be thinking of a quantum computer.
   Relatively few and simple concepts from quantum mechanics are needed
   to make quantum computers a possibility. The subtlety has been in
   learning to manipulate these concepts. Is such a computer an
   inevitability or will it be too difficult to build? 
   
   
   
   In this paper we give a tutorial on how quantum mechanics can be used
   to improve computation. Our challenge: solving an exponentially
   difficult problem for a conventional computer---that of factoring a
   large number. As a prelude, we review the standard tools of
   computation, universal gates and machines. These ideas are then
   applied first to classical, dissipationless computers and then to
   quantum computers. A schematic model of a quantum computer is
   described as well as some of the subtleties in its programming. The
   Shor algorithm [1,2] for efficiently factoring numbers on a quantum
   computer is presented in two parts: the quantum procedure within the
   algorithm and the classical algorithm that calls the quantum
   procedure. The mathematical structure in factoring which makes the
   Shor algorithm possible is discussed. We conclude with an outlook to
   the feasibility and prospects for quantum computation in the coming
   years.
   
   Let us start by describing the problem at hand: factoring a number N
   into its prime factors (e.g., the number 51688 may be decomposed as ).
   A convenient way to quantify how quickly a particular algorithm may
   solve a problem is to ask how the number of steps to complete the
   algorithm scales with the size of the ``input'' the algorithm is fed.
   For the factoring problem, this input is just the number N we wish to
   factor; hence the length of the input is . (The base of the logarithm
   is determined by our numbering system. Thus a base of 2 gives the
   length in binary; a base of 10 in decimal.) `Reasonable' algorithms
   are ones which scale as some small-degree polynomial in the input size
   (with a degree of perhaps 2 or 3).
   
   On conventional computers the best known factoring algorithm runs in
   steps [3]. This algorithm, therefore, scales exponentially with the
   input size . For instance, in 1994 a 129 digit number (known as RSA129
   [3']) was successfully factored using this algorithm on approximately
   1600 workstations scattered around the world; the entire factorization
   took eight months [4]. Using this to estimate the prefactor of the
   above exponential scaling, we find that it would take roughly 800,000
   years to factor a 250 digit number with the same computer power;
   similarly, a 1000 digit number would require years (significantly lon
   ger than the age of the universe). The difficulty of factoring large
   numbers is crucial for public-key cryptosystems, such as ones used by
   banks. There, such codes rely on the difficulty of factoring numbers
   with around 250 digits.
   
   Recently, an algorithm was developed for factoring numbers on a
   quantum computer which runs in steps where is small [1]. This is
   roughly quadratic in the input size, so factoring a 1000 digit number
   with such an algorithm would require only a few million steps. The
   implication is that public key cryptosystems based on factoring may be
   breakable.
   
   To give you an idea of how this exponential improvement might be
   possible, we review an elementary quantum mechanical experiment that
   demonstrates where such power may lie hidden [5]. The two-slit
   experiment is prototypic for observing quantum mechanical behavior: A
   source emits photons, electrons or other particles that arrive at a
   pair of slits. These particles undergo unitary evolution and finally
   measurement. We see an interference pattern, with both slits open,
   which wholely vanishes if either slit is covered. In some sense, the
   particles pass through both slits in parallel. If such unitary
   evolution were to represent a calculation (or an operation within a
   calculation) then the quantum system would be performing computations
   in parallel. Quantum parallelism comes for free. The output of this
   system would be given by the constructive interference among the
   parallel computations.
