Sen. Kerry is not as extreme as Sen. Kerrey, but he still is an enemy of
strong encryption. I wrote last year:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The committee also approved amendments proposed by
Kerry that would give jurisdiction over crypto exports
to a nine-member "Encryption Export Advisory Board."
The panel would "evaluate whether [a] market exists
abroad" and make non-binding recommendations to the
president.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Here's what he's been up to recently...

        KERRY: DAMAGE CONTROL
	Boston Globe's Black reports, Boston atty Robert Crowe on
12/29 resigned as chair of Sen. John Kerry's (D) camp. finance
cmte "in response to negative publicity that featured his ties"
to Kerry.  Crowe, "a longtime close personal friend and financial
supporter" of Kerry's, "reportedly decided that he had had enough
of critical newspaper stories, sources close to Kerry said."
Kerry, responding to the resignation which he termed
"understandable": "Bob Crowe has done an outstanding job for me,
often at the expense of his own personal life."  Crowe had "made
headlines" recently in regard to his role as a lobbyist for
Boston's Big Dig and his work for a firm hired by the Swiss
Bankers Assn. Kerry's finance cmte will be "'streamlined'" and
headed by Peter Maroney who was hired by the campaign last fall
(12/30).
	CHUNG CONNECTION?
	A Los Angeles Times article by Rempel &amp; Miller reported that
Kerry received $10K in '97 from Dem contributor Johnny Chung
following Chung's "high-level meeting" with SEC officials,
arranged for him by Kerry's office soon after he paid a visit
there. A Kerry spokesperson "confirmed that Kerry's office
contacted the SEC" on Chung's behalf, "but she said it involved
no more than helping arrange "'a tour.'"  The DoJ is
investigating the contribution which Chung is said to have made
through several employees and others whom he reimbursed. Kerry
spokesperson Tovah Ravitz "acknowledged" that Chung was
approached for a donation "'numerous times because they were
nearing the end of a tough campaign.'" Although Ravitz said
Kerry's office arranged a tour for Chung, SEC officials "said the
request on behalf of Chung involved a briefing session" (12/24).
Boston Globe's Zitner follows up on the Times story, reporting
that Chung's visit to the SEC "was something more than a casual
tour but something less than special access to high government
official, the SEC said." Kerry's Ravitz said Chung made the
request for a stop at the SEC during an 8/96 visit, accompanied
by other Asian businessmen, to Kerry's office. Chung and the
others visited the SEC later the same day (12/25). On 12/26, USA
Today reported that Ravitz said the Times was incorrect in its
initial report (12/26).
