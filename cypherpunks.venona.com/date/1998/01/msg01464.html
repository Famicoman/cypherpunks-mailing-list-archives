Hello my name is Denette,

PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!

The company I was working for just went out of business and I've been looking for a job.  I always 
used to delete unsolicited e-mail advertisements before I finished reading them.  I received what I 
assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.

Recently I received it again and thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this, I need the money.  I 
can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little 
excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a 
small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned 
how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! 

You just need to follow the directions EXACTLY and you will reap the rewards also.  Read this letter, 
pick a lifelong dream you have and apply the letter and you will achieve success.  It really is that 
easy.  You don't need to be a wizard at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open 
an envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  
If I can do this, so can you!

                       GO FOR IT NOW!!

The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!

You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may ever see.  Many times 
over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This program is 
showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional 
income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require you to come in contact 
with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get 
the mail and go to the bank!  

This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the easy instructions in this letter, 
and your financial dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level 
marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME! 

Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc., 
    -  Even retire! 

This is your chance, so don't pass it up!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail. 
As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our 
products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your 
computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  
Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:

  * $5.00 cash
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours!  This 
is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! 

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!

******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).
     
     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE 
        REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
        RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose 
        name appears on the list next to the report.
  
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four
        reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can save them
        on your computer and resell them.

     *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports. 
         Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send 
         to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
     to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is
     instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out on the
     majority of your profits.  Once you  understand the way this works, you'll 
     also see how it doesn't work if you change it.  Remember, this method 
     has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address 
         under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the one that 
         was there down to REPORT #2.  

    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
         REPORT #3.  

    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
         REPORT #4.  

    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
         the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.

Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save 
     it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this 
     letter.
  
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
     WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
     and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another
     avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.  
     You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you
     can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. 
     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report
     they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
     ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out,
     with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't
     advertise until they receive the report!

------------------------------------------

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people 
to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger 
response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline 
members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
                                                   THIS TOTALS        -----------&gt;$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think 
for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get 100's of 
participants! THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You obviously 
already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT#3 shows you the most 
productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors 
even work on trade!

About 50,000 new people get online every month!

*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******

 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow 
     the directions accurately.

 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when 
    the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report to comply with the 
U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. 
Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state that "a product or 
service must be exchanged for money received."

 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
    instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!

 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you 
do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you 
don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT 
#2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to 
roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.  
If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process 
again!  There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!

NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name, how income tax is 
handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for 
free help and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via 
telephone and free seminars about business taxes.

*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not trying to 
place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm 
living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost 
to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to 
financial security. 
          Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS

     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major 
U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris 
about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you 
so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had 
received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was 
shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have 
joined Doris in her "hobby."   I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat 
race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.
           Frank T., Bel-Air, MD

    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any doubts you have will 
vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the 
plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!!
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely 
profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several 
times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal 
effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with 
money still coming in.
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.

    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this 
plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just 
no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when 
I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got so overloaded that I 
had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of 
my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people 
live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
         Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a 
try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
another program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than 
$41,000 on the first try!!
          D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN

     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home 
on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work 
for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  
Good luck and happy spending!
           Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA
