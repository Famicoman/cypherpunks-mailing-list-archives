RPK InvisiMail(tm), secure Internet e-mail with globally available strong
encryption for Microsoft, Netscape platforms

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12, 1998 - InvisiMail Ltd (www.InvisiMail.com)
announced today immediate worldwide availability of RPK(tm) InvisiMail(tm),
a standards-based e-mail security add-in for Microsoft, Netscape and other
POP3/SMTP Internet e-mail clients and gateway servers.  Tested and
certified by the International Computer Security Association
(www.ncsa.com), RPK InvisiMail automatically and transparently encrypts
e-mail messages and attachments, authenticates the sender and verifies the
contents of each message have not been changed in transit.

RPK InvisiMail is globally available with high strength encryption.
InvisiMail and the underlying RPK encryption algorithm were developed
outside the United States.  Therefore, InvisiMail is not subject to
restrictive U.S. export policies.  RPK InvisiMail is as easy to set up and
use as anti-virus software, and just as important.

While Microsoft and Netscape battle each other with incompatible and
difficult to use security offerings, InvisiMail seamlessly integrates with
ALL popular POP3/SMTP e-mail products including Netscape, Microsoft,
Eudora, Pegasus, Calypso -- more than any other solution available today --
making it the preferred e-mail security product for multi-platform use,
worldwide.

All InvisiMail users can send the FREE InvisiMail Intro version to anyone
worldwide, providing compatibility without requiring others to purchase
anything, making InvisiMail unique among
e-mail security offerings.

"Most people don't realize that their e-mail can be forged, altered or read
by anyone, any time, without any evidence," said Jack Oswald, President and
CEO of RPK Ltd.  "Without products like RPK InvisiMail, communications on
the Internet are untrustworthy."

InvisiMail uses the RPK Fast Public Key Encryptonite(tm) Engine, the
strongest cryptography available worldwide today.  RPK is dramatically
faster than the well-known RSA algorithm, yet just as secure.  RPK has been
analyzed by world class cryptographers who have issued reports on the
security and integrity of the technology.

"InvisiMail is the easiest, fastest, most transparent e-mail security
product I have seen," said Kevin Shannon, President of net*Gain, a
specialist in launching Internet companies. "This is the product we've all
been waiting for."

As part of its official launch, InvisiMail Professional is available FREE
to all New Zealand residents for ninety days.

RPK InvisiMail is available in two desktop versions: Intro (FREE) and
Professional (introductory price $29.95).  RPK InvisiMail Enterprise
Gateway Server will be available Q2 1998.  InvisiMail can be downloaded
from: www.InvisiMail.com.
