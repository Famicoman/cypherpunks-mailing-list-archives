Will you please forward this to cypherpunks and anyplace else that might
find it interesting?  Thanks.


Today, I called Netscape because of a problem with it being unable to play
.wav files on a webpage (without a plug-in).  I am using Netscape Gold 
3.03.

I won't get 3.04 after reading about it's new "fixes" that say NOT to use a
~ for webpage addresses, but instead, to use /./ -- Is anyone in their 
right
mind going to try that on their webpages?  I've got about 40 megs of
webpages and I'm NOT going to reconfigure them because Netscape's
programmers are a bunch of jackasses.

I configured Netscape's helper applications menu to use mplayer, which is
bundled with Windows, and then tried to use it to browse my own webpage,
with a .wav file on it.

(1)  Netscape would not save the configuration of mplayer in the helper
applications settings.  Mplayer would stay in the configuration for that
session, but upon exiting to DOS and reloading Windows and Netscape, the
setting would no longer be present.

(2)  If I didn't check to see that mplayer was still set up in the Netscape
helper applications configuration, and browsed the page with the .wav file,
I would get a message from Netscape "Unable to play .wav file."

In the meantime, Netscape WIPED OUT all my sound drivers in memory.  They
were still present in the windows/system directory, but had to be (1)
reloaded through Windows Utilities; (2) reloaded through Soundblaster
utilities in DOS and (3) I had to do a cold reboot to get them to work again.

THEN I found that the volume on the mixer that comes with Windows, had been
set to "0" by Netscape.

Since I could duplicate these results, repeatedly, it appeared to be a bug.


I called Netscape about it.

GRADY WILSON AT NETSCAPE TOLD ME TO USE INTERNET EXPLORER.

First he told me to reinstall Netscape (already did that).
Then he told me to get Netscape 3.04.  I told him I wouldn't and I wanted to
know why Netscape out of the box, which is SUPPOSED to play a .wav file,
wouldn't play a .wav file and wouldn't save the configuration.  He said it
would, and I said obviously it doesn't, or I wouldn't be calling, and why
else would Netscape have to have a blue million "plug ins."

Next he said "mplayer" was corrupt (it isn't and works fine, even with
Netscape, so long as Netscape hasn't yet deleted its own configuration
setting mplayer to play .wav files).  I told him this.

That is when 

GRADY WILSON AT NETSCAPE TOLD ME TO USE INTERNET EXPLORER.

So, congratulations, Bill, you've won.  NETSCAPE ITSELF is now telling
people to get Explorer.
