Hi,

Not shure why this thing bounced but I'm going ahead and forwarding it to

&gt; 
&gt; there are different theories about why our government has gotten
&gt; so bad, but I subscribe to the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. the public and media
&gt; has not done its duty to keep our government in check. in addition
&gt; to the 3 branches of govt as "checks and balances" built into our
&gt; system, the public and media are the other two crucial ingredients.
&gt; our forefathers didn't imagine either the public or media going bad,
&gt; but that's what's happened imho.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. various special interests have hijacked the government. one of the
&gt; biggest parasites is the "military industrial complex". 
&gt; 
&gt; the following book speaks to these points, and some here might be
&gt; interested. I believe our government could be reformed if enough
&gt; people cared, particularly those in the media and the public. a
&gt; position I know will not be shared by any anarchists here.

&gt; 
&gt; The New York Times Book Review, Tim Weiner :
&gt; Left in draft form at his death from brain cancer three years ago,
&gt; completed by his friends and family, Secrets is Mackenzie's legacy: a book
&gt; obsessed. Like the man, it is an unruly piece of work, but it grabs you by
&gt; the lapels and holds on.
&gt; 
&gt; Synopsis:
&gt; Drawing from government documents, scores of interviews, and numerous
&gt; stories of CIA malfeasance, the late journalist Angus Mackenzie lays bare
&gt; the behind-the-scenes evolution of a policy of suppression, repression,
&gt; spying, and harassment beginning before the Johnson administration and
&gt; continuing to the present. 11 illustrations.
&gt; 
&gt; Card catalog description
&gt; This eye-opening expose, the result of fifteen years of investigative work,
&gt; uncovers the CIA's systematic efforts over several decades to suppress and
&gt; censor information. Angus Mackenzie, an award-winning yournalist, filed and
&gt; won a lawsuit against the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act, and in
&gt; the process became an expert on government censorship and domestic spying.
&gt; Mackenzie lays bare a complex narrative of intrigue among federal agencies
&gt; and their senior staff, including the Department of Defense, the executive
&gt; branch, and the CIA. From cover-ups and secrecy oaths, to scandals over
&gt; leaks and exposure, to the government's often insidious attempts to monitor
&gt; and control public access to information, Mackenzie tracks the evolution of
&gt; a policy of suppression, repression, spying, and harassment.
&gt; 
&gt; The publisher, University of California Press, www.ucpress.edu , 08/20/97:
&gt; This Book is Now Available
&gt; "If anything is more corrupting than power, it is power exercised in
&gt; secret. Angus Mackenzie's magnificently researched, lucidly written study
&gt; of the CIA's outrageous threats to freedom in America over the years is a
&gt; summons to vigilance to protect our democratic institutions."
&gt; --Daniel Schorr
&gt; 
&gt; "The late Angus Mackenzie has left an appropriate legacy in Secrets: The
&gt; CIA's War at Home, a fitting capstone to his long career of exposing
&gt; government secrecy and manipulation of public information. Secrets is a
&gt; detailed, fascinating and chilling account of the agency's program of
&gt; disinformation and concealment of public information against its own
&gt; citizens."
&gt; --Ben H. Bagdikian, author of THE MEDIA MONOPOLY
&gt; 
&gt; "Scrupulously reported, fleshed out with a fascinating cast of characters,
&gt; skillfully illuminating a subject the news media seldom looked into and
&gt; never got straight, Angus Mackenzie's last and best work richly deserves a
&gt; posthumous Pulitzer -- for nonfiction, history, or both."
&gt; --Jon Swan, former senior editor, Columbia Journalism Review
&gt; 
&gt; "This courageous, uncompromising book belongs on the bookshelf of every
&gt; serious student of journalism and the First Amendment."
&gt; --Tom Goldstein, Dean, Graduate School of Journalism, Columbia University
&gt; 
&gt; "Even in 1997, the exposures of courageous, enterprising journalists like
&gt; Mackenzie are crucial for an open government."
&gt; --Publishers Weekly
&gt; 
&gt; This eye-opening expose, the result of fifteen years of investigative work,
&gt; uncovers the CIA's systematic efforts to suppress and censor information
&gt; over several decades. An award-winning journalist, Angus Mackenzie waged
&gt; and won a lawsuit against the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act and
&gt; became a leading expert on questions government censorship and domestic
&gt; spying. In Secrets, he reveals how federal agencies--including the
&gt; Department of Defense, the executive branch, and the CIA--have monitored and
&gt; controlled public access to information. Mackenzie lays bare the
&gt; behind-the-scenes evolution of a policy of suppression, repression, spying,
&gt; and harassment.
&gt; 
&gt; Secrecy operations originated during the Cold War as the CIA instituted
&gt; programs of domestic surveillance and agent provocateur activities. As
&gt; antiwar newspapers flourished, the CIA set up an "underground newspaper"
&gt; desk devoted, as Mackenzie reports, to various counterintelligence
&gt; activities--from infiltrating organizations to setting up CIA-front student
&gt; groups. Mackenzie also tracks the policy of requiring secrecy contracts for
&gt; all federal employees who have contact with sensitive information, insuring
&gt; governmental review of all their writings after leaving government employ.
&gt; 
&gt; Drawing from government documents and scores of interviews, many of which
&gt; required intense persistence and investigative guesswork to obtain, and
&gt; amassing story after story of CIA malfeasance, Mackenzie gives us the best
&gt; account we have of the government's present security apparatus. This is a
&gt; must-read book for anyone interested in the inside secrets of government
&gt; spying, censorship, and the abrogation of First Amendment rights.
&gt; 
&gt; FROM THE BOOK:
&gt; "The major villains of the censorship story are a succession of
&gt; policymakers from the Johnson administration through the Bush
&gt; administration and on into the Clinton years, including several presidents
&gt; themselves. In a sense, theirs is a spy story--not an action-packed one like
&gt; in the movies but one about sleight-of-hand and subterfuge far truer to
&gt; reality."
&gt; 
&gt; ANGUS MACKENZIE (1950-1994), an investigative reporter known for his
&gt; persistence and independence, was one of the nation's foremost experts on
&gt; freedom of information laws. Known for crusading journalism in defense of
&gt; the First Amendment, his work appeared in publications ranging from
&gt; alternative weeklies to the Washington Post and the Columbia Journalism
&gt; Review. Mackenzie was affiliated with the Center for Investigative
&gt; Reporting in San Francisco and taught at the School of Journalism at the
&gt; University of California, Berkeley.
&gt; 
&gt; DAVID WEIR was a co-founder of the Center for Investigative Reporting,
&gt; where he managed contracts with "60 Minutes," "20/20," CNN, CBS News, ABC
&gt; News, and many other outlets. He served as editor and writer at a number of
&gt; publications, including Rolling Stone, Mother Jones, and the San Francisco
&gt; Examiner. He has won or shared over two dozen journalism awards, including
&gt; the National Magazine Award.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From Kirkus Reviews , 07/01/97:
&gt; A muckraking adventure in the violation of First Amendment rights. Although
&gt; it probably won't come as a surprise to most readers that the federal
&gt; government is capable of spying on its citizens, Mackenzie professes a
&gt; certain bewilderment at the lengths to which the CIA went to suppress
&gt; dissent in the days of Vietnam. The veteran left-wing journalist, who died
&gt; of brain cancer in 1994, began his career as the publisher of an antiwar
&gt; rag called the People's Dreadnaught; harassed by campus police, he was
&gt; forced to suspend publication, although he later won $2,500 in a lawsuit
&gt; against Beloit College over the matter. At a national level, he writes,
&gt; similar suppression was the order of the day. Although the CIA is
&gt; constrained by law from conducting investigations ``inside the continental
&gt; limits of the United States and its possessions,'' in fact, Mackenzie
&gt; charges, it concocted an elaborate counterintelligence program against
&gt; various home-grown protest groups in the 1960s and early '70s, reasoning
&gt; that it was taking antiterrorist measures and thus living up to the spirit,
&gt; if not the letter, of its charter. Among the targets, Mackenzie writes, was
&gt; Ramparts, a venerable leftist magazine that managed to earn the wrath of
&gt; the Feds by reporting on that very internal spying. Other targets were the
&gt; libertarian guru Karl Hess, renegade CIA whistleblowers Victor Marchetti
&gt; and Philip Agee, and a host of lesser-known dissidents. The CIA emerges as
&gt; the heavy, naturally, but the real villains in Mackenzie's account are
&gt; various policymakers from the Johnson administration to the present.
&gt; ``Incrementally over the years they expanded a policy of censorship to the
&gt; point that today it pervades every agency and every department of the
&gt; federal government,'' he writes. And, he continues, that change was so
&gt; gradual that few guardians of the First Amendment noticed. Mackenzie is
&gt; occasionally over the top, sometimes glib. But his charges ring true, and
&gt; civil-liberties advocates will find much of interest in his pages. (11 b&amp;w
