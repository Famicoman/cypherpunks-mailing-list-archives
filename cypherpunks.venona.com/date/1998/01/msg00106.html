&gt; you choose to ban postings originating from such systems. Thanks.

That's me.

I decided to stop accepting posts from anonymous remailers way back,
when anon.penet.fi was still alive. Some of that is philosophy, some of
that was problems.

As far as problems, it's the normal stuff -- personal attacks,
mailbombing through anonymous remailers, copyright/slander/libel
issues, all the normal fun and games. Since you can't track users back,
you have real problems policing them. And since anonymous remailers
tend to allow multiple (heading towards infinite) remailing addresses,
the practical issue of how to lock out an abusive user becomes severe.
That's why Juno is bounced -- you can create accounts and then use them
instantly, with no policing and no tracking. I had a problem a while
back with an idiot who did, abusively. After about four rounds of
trying to get him to go away, I did it the hard way, with a virtual
neutron bomb.

Juno's no help. In THAT case, I got email from them six weeks later
apologizing for being so delayed in responding to my requests for help.
they didn't offer to help, they just apologized for not telling me they
wouldn't for so long. And that's been typical of my dealing with them.
They don't police. They don't care. Their systems are set up so that
basically, they *can't* police things.

So I just don't even get into it. Since I can't police their users, I
police their site. Effectively, they are an anonymous remailer. God
knows enough folks use them as one.
