&gt; &gt;Archiving USENET as a separable enterprise which charges for access
&gt; &gt;(altavista for example charges via advertisements) seems less
&gt; &gt;problematic than directly trying to build a database of controversial
&gt; &gt;materials.  Archiving it all partly reduces your liability I think,
&gt; &gt;because you are not being selective, you just happen to have a
&gt; &gt;business which archives USENET.  However there are two problems with
&gt; &gt;this: a) volume -- USENET daily volume is huge; b) the censors will
&gt; &gt;ask you to remove articles they object to from the archive.
&gt;
&gt; News spool services are already showing signs of getting into this "Usenet
&gt; censorship" business in a bigger way. Some news spool services honor
&gt; cancellations (and some don't).  Some don't carry the "sensitive"
&gt; newsgroups. And so on. Nothing in their setup really exempts them from
&gt; child porn prosecutions--no more so than a bookstore or video store is
&gt; exempted, as the various busts of bookstores and whatnot show, including
&gt; the "Tin Drum" video rental case in Oklahoma City.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The solution I am using is to keep reposting articles via remailers.
&gt; &gt;Have agents which you pay to repost.  This presents the illusion of
&gt;
&gt; This of course doesn't scale at all well. It is semi-OK for a tiny, sparse
&gt; set of reposted items, but fails utterly for larger database sets. (If and
&gt; when Adam's reposted volumes begin to get significant, he will be viewed as
&gt; a spammer. :-) )
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; - CD-ROMS made of Eternity files and then sold or distributed widely
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is an interesting suggestion, but surely would open the
&gt; &gt;distributor up for liability, especially if copyright software were
&gt; &gt;amongst the documents.  Were you thinking of
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The CD-ROM distribution is just a side aspect, to get some set of data
&gt; widely dispersed. For example, if the data base is of "abortion" or
&gt; "euthanasia" information (a la Hemlock Society), which various parties want
&gt; suppressed, then handing out freebie CD-ROMs is one step.
&gt;
&gt; Many examples of this: Samizdats in Russia, crypto/PGP diskettes handed out
&gt; at conferences (was Ray Arachelian doing this several years ago?), and
&gt; various religious and social tracts. Obviously, this is what broadsheets
&gt; and fliers are designed to do. Self-publishing in general.
&gt;
&gt; If the intent is to collect money for the data base accesses, then of
&gt; course other considerations come into play.
&gt;
&gt; (Critical to these "Eternity" things is a good model of the customers, the
&gt; reasons for the data, etc.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; - purely cyberspatial locations, with no know nexus
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; (I point to my own "BlackNet" experiment as one approach.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is the best option.  Make it entirely distributed, so there is no
&gt; &gt;nexus, period.  cyberspacial -&gt; meatspace mappings are often easier to
&gt; &gt;trace than we would wish, especially where there is continued usage
&gt; &gt;(for example there are various active attacks which can make progress
&gt; &gt;even against mixmaster remailers).  This is the weak point of my
&gt; &gt;reposting agent, be that human, or automated.
&gt;
&gt; My model, contained in the actual working software (*), allowed customers
&gt; to pick some topic, enclose a public key and payment, use a remailer to
&gt; post, then collect the information some time later. Using Usenet, but not
&gt; by reposting the actual data. Only pointers.
&gt;
&gt; (* I say "working" in the sense that the concept was very easy to
&gt; demonstrate just by using PGP and remailers. Not much more than what I
&gt; demonstrated in 1993 would be needed to deploy a real system. Except for
&gt; one thing: true digital cash. Not the bullshit one-way-traceable stuff that
&gt; Chaum and others are now pushing, but the original, online-cleared or
&gt; escrow-cleared form, a la the work of Goldberg et. al. For some of these
&gt; applications, below, simple token- or coupon-based schemes might work
&gt; adequately.)
&gt;
&gt; How these models will work using existing infrastructure (Usenet,
&gt; remailers, Web proxies, etc.) depends on some factors. It might be useful
&gt; to consider some benchmark applications, such as:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Anonymous purchase of financially important data. (A good example being
&gt; the Arbitron ratings for radio markets...subscription to Arbitron is quite
&gt; expensive, and posting of results on Usenet is prosecuted by Arbitron. A
&gt; good example of a BlackNet market.)
&gt;
&gt; 2. Anonymous purchase of long articles, e.g., encycopedia results...
&gt;
&gt; (I'm not sure there's still a market for this....)
&gt;
&gt; 3. Anonymous purchase of "term papers." (A thriving market for ghostwritten
&gt; articles...already migrating to the Web, but lacking adequate anonymizing
&gt; methods.)
&gt;
&gt; This is an example of a very large data base (all term papers on file)
&gt; which cannot possibly by distributed feasibly by Usenet.
&gt;
&gt; And so on...lots of various examples.
&gt;
&gt; The whole Eternity thing is interesting, but we haven't made a lot of
&gt; progress, it seems to me. (I distributed a proposal a bit similar to what
&gt; Ross Anderson was proposing, a proposal more oriented toward making a
&gt; _persistent_ Web URL for academics and lawyers to reliably cite, with less
&gt; of the "404--File Not Found" sorts of messages, the things which make the
&gt; Web largely unusable for academic and scientific citations.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is also likely in the extreme that a working Eternity service will
&gt; &gt;&gt; quickly be hit with attackers of various sorts who want to test the limits
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the service, or who want such services shut down.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree with this prediction.  Remailers have seen this pattern, with
&gt; &gt;`baiting' of operators, and apparently people posting controversial
&gt; &gt;materials and reporting the materials to the SPA or others themselves,
&gt; &gt;etc.
&gt;
&gt; Yep, it's hard to disagree with this. Any centralized "Eternity service"
&gt; will be hit with various kinds of attacks in quick order.
&gt;
&gt; Building a data base, as Ryan comments seem to indicate he is mostly
&gt; interested in doing, is the least of the concerns.
