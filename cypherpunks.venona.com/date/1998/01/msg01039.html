&gt;&gt; &gt;Anguilla seems to be a doing agood job on becoming a country
&gt;&gt; &gt;willing on hosting data havens.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It's been a while since we talked about this (at least on the Cypherpunks
&gt;&gt; list), but a couple of years ago there was much discusson on the CP list
&gt;&gt; about just what items would be allowable in Anguilla. Vince Cate gave his
&gt;&gt; assessment, which I found fairly nebulous, in that it appeared the Ruling
&gt;&gt; Families would allow what they would allow, and not allow what they would
&gt;&gt; not allow---there seemed to be a lot of ad hoc rulings.
&gt;
&gt;If memory serves me right it was because Vince bounced off the Taxbomber
&gt;site because it offered second passports, camouflage passports, and other
&gt;products that was considered a fraud, Which to me sounds odd since there
&gt;is some other company selling most everthing and then some from an .ai
&gt;domain which Vince's company has the monopoly on handing out .ai domains
&gt;
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.ultramec.com.ai">http://www.ultramec.com.ai</A>
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (Given that copies of "Penthouse" are illegal in Anguilla, if I recall this
&gt;&gt; correctly, and given that gun are illegal, and drugs are illegal, I rather
&gt;&gt; doubt that Anguilla would happily host "The Aryan Nations Bomb Site," or
&gt;&gt; "Pedophile Heaven," or "Gun Smuggler's Digest. " Or the even juicier stuff
&gt;&gt; any "data haven" with any claim to really being a data haven will surely
&gt;&gt; have.)
&gt;
&gt;You also have to wonder how far in the future it will be before the
&gt;special forces of some banana republic drops in on Vince to blow-up
&gt;his operation for as he advertises publishing censored information 
&gt;on ones ex-president on the Internet, or for that matter I have
&gt;yet to see abortion information coming from his servers. 
&gt;
&gt;What has happened in Anguilla proves that there will be a need for 
&gt;different flavors of datahavens, Different degrees libility that
&gt;datahaven owners will want to store information on their servers.  
&gt;I would love to open a XXX WWW site in Anguilla pulling in the 
&gt;industry average of $5-10K a month and not pay any taxes there, 
&gt;But it won't happen in Anguilla with the present adminstration!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;And there are likely under a hundred oil companies looking
&gt;&gt; &gt;for firms to 'recycle' their old oil platforms and drilling
&gt;&gt; &gt;rigs wasting away around the world, I'm sure some might just
&gt;&gt; &gt;give you one just to be rid of future liability.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Given the willingness of the French to have SDECE sink Greenpeace ships in
&gt;&gt; neutral ports, how long before a couple of kilos of Semtex are applied to
&gt;&gt; the underside of these oil rigs?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Given what happened with "pirate broadcast tankers," the future is not
bright.
&gt;
&gt;Isn't there a microstate off the coast of England called 'Sealand' run
&gt;from a former oil rig/gun battery for the last 20 years?  
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; When the first "oil rig data haven" is found to have kiddie porn,
&gt;&gt; bomb-making info, and (shudder) material doubting the historicity of the
&gt;&gt; Holocaust, the U.N. will cluck and the public will cheer when it is boarded
&gt;&gt; and seized, or simply sunk.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As I said in my last piece on this subject, there is no security in
&gt;&gt; meatspace comparable to what is gotten with mathematics.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; --Tim May
&gt;
&gt;I agree completely, But there is still room for massively distrubted
&gt;datahavens on oil rigs, barges, gun batteries, island nations or
&gt;hiding in Norm's LAN in Cicero IL.  All the harder to supress that
&gt;information.
