&gt;Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;
&gt;Imagine finding old friends, classmates, long lost relatives, old shipmates, ex-husbands, ex-wives, old girlfriends, or old boyfriends...
&gt;
&gt;WE FIND PEOPLE
&gt;
&gt;No matter why you are looking we can help. We utilize only ethical and legal means. Nothing is obtained though any illegal means whatsoever.
&gt;
&gt;The explosion in on-line information has allowed us to build an extremely powerful database searching program specifically designed to locate people...
&gt;
&gt;We search over 90 data bases instantly -- electronically searching virtually every clue that a trained gumshoe might think of -- and then some.
&gt;
&gt;PUBLIC RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE
&gt;
&gt;No doubt you have read that information about you and almost everyone else is available on-line. Its TRUE! Every time you renew your drivers license, apply for credit, order goods my mail or subscribe to a periodical, the information about who you are and where you can be found is created. The information is not always free -- but it is certainly out there -- readily available to anyone who knows how and where to look.
&gt;
&gt;If fact there is entirely too much information available! Huge amounts of data make searching for your piece of the puzzle exceedingly difficult.
&gt;
&gt;WE HAVE AUTOMATED THE PROCESS
&gt;
&gt;Our computers search in a systematic automated way for the information you need. Without an organized and automated search program you would literally drown in the data. Which state's motor vehicle records would you check first? What if it cost some money?
&gt;
&gt;We know where to look -- we have been locating people for years working with insurance companies, collection agencies and attorneys. If a public record is available we will know about it, and we will have the access necessary to get results.
&gt;
&gt;LOW COST!
&gt;
&gt;Our highly organized and automated structure allows us to work for our clients on a person by person basis for a very low cost -- $19.00 per search payable by credit card or check. Not bad considering that access to some of the 34 states who offer DMV information on-line can cost upwards of $200 per year. And private detectives can charge $200 per hour!!!
&gt;
&gt;WHAT YOU GET
&gt;
&gt;The basic search results will give you the name and address of the person you are searching for. The cost for this basic service is $19.00. Additional charges are:
&gt;
&gt;     Telephone number: $10.00
&gt;     Social Security number: $10.00
&gt;     Spouse name: $10.00
&gt;     Date of Birth: $10.00
&gt;
&gt;You will only be charged for the information you request and the information we are able to provide.
&gt;
&gt;HOW IT WORKS
&gt;
&gt;If we find the person you are looking for, and only if we find them, we will charge your credit card or deposit your check. If we don't find them, we won't charge you or we will return your check. You don't need to sign a long-term contract, have a modem hook up, Internet access or anything else. Simply print the Search Form, complete it and fax it to us at (212) 213-3320. We will fulfill your request within twenty four hours. If E-mail is more convenient, just complete the form below and reply to search@peoplefinders.net, or if you prefer, you can mail your request to: PeopleFinders, Inc. 11 East 36th Street, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10016.
&gt;
&gt;REMEMBER - IT'S GUARANTEED
