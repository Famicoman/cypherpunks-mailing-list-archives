Someone sent me this article, saying it sounded a bit like me. I agree.

Interesting to hear this guy calling for justice to be given to  some
government criminals.

&gt;
&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt;
&gt;A Return to Accountability
&gt;
&gt;    By "The Guardian"
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    In 1994, there was the so-called "Republican Revolution." Supposedly,
&gt;we finally got a
&gt;    bunch of "good" politicians into office to fix things. Fat lot of good
&gt;that did us. The
&gt;    American people were stabbed in the back by these so called "good"
&gt;politicians. They
&gt;    gave us more gun-free school zones, after the Supreme Court said that
&gt;Congress does not
&gt;    have that authority; they gave us a National ID card law; they gave us
&gt;the biggest seizure
&gt;    of guns in our history through the domestic violence restrictions on
&gt;owning guns; they gave
&gt;    us lots of "health care crimes" that are punishable by asset
&gt;forfeiture- by both the doctor
&gt;    and the patient; they gave us several new national databases that will
&gt;track very personal
&gt;    information on virtually every American; and they gave us the specter
&gt;of secret trials with
&gt;    secret evidence for "certain" classes of people.
&gt;
&gt;    Voting is a time honored practice that allegedly allows the people to
&gt;direct the course of
&gt;    the government by choosing the leaders and focusing on the issues of
&gt;importance. The
&gt;    problem is that as a check on the government's runaway growth and
&gt;abuses, it doesn't
&gt;    work. James Collier wrote the book "VoteScam" to point out the massive
&gt;voting fraud
&gt;    that is endemic to the American electoral process. Look at the current
&gt;scandals
&gt;    surrounding the campaign finance issues. Where does the will of the
&gt;people enter into this
&gt;    process? The answer is that it doesn't.
&gt;
&gt;    So, shall we kick the issue of reforming government over to the
&gt;Courts? What a joke.
&gt;    The courts decide issues as they wish, based not upon law, but upon an
&gt;ever changing
&gt;    concept called "Public Policy." If they get a tough issue, they say
&gt;it's a "political question"
&gt;    and refuse to hear it. The right arguments can be made, but are then
&gt;rejected as being
&gt;    "frivolous" or "irrelevant." Critical issues are rarely decided on the
&gt;merits; rather, they ride
&gt;    on the crutches of manipulated "precedent."
&gt;
&gt;    Let the judges who have sworn an oath of office and posted their bond
&gt;as required by
&gt;    law come forward. The oath of office provided a contract with the
&gt;people which in the
&gt;    event of breach, provided the grounds to bring suit. The bond was
&gt;forfeit if the judge
&gt;    misbehaved. Yet these judges refuse to hold themselves to the law and
&gt;obey. The Citizen
&gt;    who demands that the judge present a copy of his oath of office and a
&gt;copy of his bond is
&gt;    ignored. Today, the citizen who tries to bring suit against a judge or
&gt;prosecutor for
&gt;    misconduct is sidelined by another judge- who is often as or more
&gt;guilty than the one being
&gt;    sued. The question is asked "Where is the justice?" There is none in
&gt;this system.
&gt;
&gt;    So what are the options that are left? Should people attempt to drop
&gt;out of the system
&gt;    and ask to simply be left alone? They might end up like the people at
&gt;Waco who were
&gt;    killed over an alleged tax deficiency- the non-payment of the transfer
&gt;tax on several
&gt;    weapons. And all of that was simply alleged. There was no court of Law
&gt;to hear their
&gt;    case, and make a finding of guilt or innocence. They were murdered by
&gt;a federal
&gt;    government that will not bring the murderers to justice. Some say that
&gt;the Davidians were
&gt;    murdered as part of an experiment to find out what the American public
&gt;was willing to
&gt;    tolerate. The Constitution came under serious attack, and the American
&gt;people cheered as
&gt;    the government tanks smashed the building, pumped in poison gas, and
&gt;then burned and
&gt;    machine gunned the inhabitants of a separatist religious sect. Don't
&gt;believe it? Go see the
&gt;    movie "Waco: Rules of Engagement." Watch your government caught in the
&gt;lie. See the
&gt;    worms wiggle and squirm.
&gt;
&gt;    What about Randy Weaver? His was just another family that was trying
&gt;to withdraw from
&gt;    what they saw as a corrupt society. Randy buried his wife and son. His
&gt;son, shot in the
&gt;    back by federal marshals, was trying to return to the house. His last
&gt;words were, "I'm
&gt;    coming daddy." Vicky, his wife, was murdered by an FBI agent named Lon
&gt;Horiuchi as
&gt;    she stood in the doorway holding an infant child in her arms. Lon, who
&gt;brags that he can
&gt;    put his shots "on a quarter" at two hundred yards, shot her in the
&gt;head at a distance of
&gt;    about two hundred yards. Vicky Weaver is long buried, and Lon is still
&gt;working for the
&gt;    FBI as a "shooter," not seeing anything wrong with what he did.
&gt;
&gt;    [Editors note: Lon Horiuchi has just been indicted by the State of
&gt;Idaho, for the
&gt;    crime of "involuntary manslaughter." Kevin Harris, who was found not
&gt;guilty by a
&gt;    jury in his federal trial, is being charged with Murder in the First
&gt;Degree. What does
&gt;    that tell you?]
&gt;
&gt;    So, if the People can't vote honest and moral leaders into office, and
&gt;there isn't any way
&gt;    to get rid of the rotten apples- or to even get damages when they have
&gt;done wrong, and
&gt;    the government has demonstrated that they will take you out if you try
&gt;to separate from the
&gt;    society, then what options are left?
&gt;
&gt;    It's a hard question with an even harder answer.
&gt;
&gt;    Go ahead and educate the public all you want -- the public is so
&gt;enamored with the 30
&gt;    second sound byte that they will never pay attention long enough to
&gt;ever present a threat
&gt;    to the established order. The government, adhering to its global
&gt;agenda, is rushing ahead
&gt;    full tilt to steamroller our remaining rights. Our own Congress and
&gt;President declared war
&gt;    on the American People in 1932 (the infamous "Trading With The Enemy
&gt;Act"), and they
&gt;    have now progressed to the rape, pillage and burn phase of the war.
&gt;Who is so foolish as
&gt;    to claim that this is not so?
&gt;
&gt;    This letter is not a call to anarchy. It is a demand for
&gt;accountability from the treasonous
&gt;    bastards that are destroying our country. The problem is that the
&gt;legislators, judges,
&gt;    prosecutors, and other public officials have chosen to sidestep the
&gt;constitutionally
&gt;    mandated checks on their power by not swearing oaths of office or
&gt;posting fidelity bonds.
&gt;    They have passed laws giving themselves immunity from suits for their
&gt;unlawful actions.
&gt;    They have created organizations of jack-booted thugs to intimidate,
&gt;harass, and
&gt;    sometimes kill anyone who is willing to speak out or show any form of
&gt;resistance. These
&gt;    scum have set themselves outside the law, and are thus by definition,
&gt;outlaws. Since they
&gt;    eschew any of the legitimate means of accountability, then it looks
&gt;like there is only one
&gt;    way to re-instill a respect for the Constitution. We must give the
&gt;members of government
&gt;    more incentive to support the Constitution limitations on government
&gt;than they have to
&gt;    violate the Constitution.
&gt;
&gt;    That means that a few of them need to be killed. Maybe a lot of them.
&gt;Perhaps when they
&gt;    see that there is a final solution available to the people, and that
&gt;they are not untouchable,
&gt;    they might start acting in an accountable manner. Since our public
&gt;servants have separated
&gt;    themselves from all of the established forms of accountability, it is
&gt;time to return to
&gt;    Chairman Mao's observation: All political power emanates from the
&gt;barrel of a gun.
&gt;
&gt;    You say: "That's immoral!" I respond that morality is concerned with
&gt;right and wrong.
&gt;    When an organized group attacks you, your family, or your community,
&gt;then they have
&gt;    performed what can only be described as an act of war. The response of
&gt;any moral
&gt;    individual is that you defend yourself and prosecute the war to the
&gt;fullest extent possible,
&gt;    for the purpose of winning. Preemptive strikes are just part of the
&gt;rules of the road for this
&gt;    task. Wars are either won or lost, and the Federal Government, along
&gt;with the various
&gt;    state apparatuses, is at war with the American People. Cliche» as it
&gt;sounds, they drew first
&gt;    blood.
&gt;
&gt;    So if they are to be killed, it must be done for cause. Those laboring
&gt;to bring our nation
&gt;    back to its Republican rule of Law must not kill innocent people in
&gt;the process. Blowing
&gt;    up innocent children and non-participants is just as much a crime as
&gt;any that the tyrants
&gt;    have committed. The way to change the government is through the
&gt;surgically precise
&gt;    excision of the traitorous lumps. The wiser ones will see the writing
&gt;on the wall, and there
&gt;    will be a spontaneous remission of the treasonous disease.
&gt;
&gt;    The only problem that remains is in identifying the enemy. Moral
&gt;action requires that the
&gt;    right targets be chosen. Focusing on the low level players would not
&gt;significantly affect the
&gt;    treasonous policies. It is the ruling elite that promulgates the
&gt;policies, and it is they who
&gt;    must be held accountable. the charge is willful treason, and the
&gt;sentence is preordained.
&gt;    When the ruling elite realize that they are not immune to
&gt;accountability for their actions,
&gt;    then changes will come quickly.
&gt;
&gt;    The major stumbling block to this plan is that most people don't have
&gt;the guts to carry out
&gt;    the deed. Or if they do, it's a spur of the moment action with no
&gt;planning or preparation.
&gt;    This is not the way to do it. Wars are not won by spur of the moment,
&gt;emotionally ignited
&gt;    actions. They are won by calm, cool planning and sound strategy. It is
&gt;up to the people as
&gt;    individuals, who can't rely on any group or organization. Too many
&gt;have been infiltrated by
&gt;    the enemy. Make sure you know what you are doing before you go off
&gt;half-cocked.
&gt;    There are lots of how-to books on this delicate subject.
&gt;
&gt;    Leave no evidence, have no connecting links, and don't flap your lips.
&gt;The result is no
&gt;    arrests. The ruling elite may call it terrorism, but did they ever
&gt;have a no-knock raid pulled
&gt;    on their house? Were they ever forced to stand in their own homes,
&gt;naked or in their
&gt;    underwear while masked federal or state agents tore the house apart-
&gt;while making crude
&gt;    jokes about their wife and terrorizing their children? Have they ever
&gt;had to try to rebuild a
&gt;    sense of "home" after the government came in and destroyed any
&gt;semblance of security
&gt;    that the family had? Did they have their pregnant wife slammed up
&gt;against the wall, causing
&gt;    her to lose the baby? Did they have to find an answer for their little
&gt;boy, when he asked if
&gt;    the welfare police were going to come back and beat up daddy?
&gt;
&gt;    What is accountability all about? The second amendment ensures that We the
&gt;    People have the means to take down the real terrorists. This is a view
&gt;most
&gt;    people won't openly discuss, though they may hold it deep in their
&gt;hearts. To
&gt;    seriously consider the idea is to potentially confront the inescapable
&gt;conclusion
&gt;    that action, not talk, is required, and that's too much for most.
&gt;
&gt;    Finally, let's talk about what happens if you get caught. There are no
&gt;prisoners in this war:
&gt;    Expect to be crucified. Tried in the press, condemned in the public
&gt;arena, and then put on
&gt;    "trial" in a court that will not allow anything but a guilty verdict.
&gt;Dumped in the worst hell of
&gt;    the prison system, fighting for your life and manhood, unable to
&gt;contact your family or find
&gt;    out anything about them. After years of incarceration, there might be
&gt;an execution, or you
&gt;    might be found dead in your cell, another unfortunate "suicide." But
&gt;if you think the
&gt;    downside is too rough, then read about what happened to the signers of
&gt;the Declaration of
&gt;    Independence. They were uniformly abused, harassed, ruined, and in
&gt;some cases killed.
&gt;    They saw horrible treatment for themselves and their families. Is the
&gt;price they paid worth
&gt;    anything?
&gt;
&gt;    If you are unable to accept the responsibility of fighting for your
&gt;freedom while there is still
&gt;    a bit of freedom to move and communicate, then you had better accept
&gt;the slavery and
&gt;    live with it. There will never be a better time to oppose the tyra.nts
&gt;than now. As in any
&gt;    war, there will be casualties. It may happen to you, whether you are
&gt;in the fight or not.
&gt;    Why wait to fall? Why stick your head in the sand and wait for things
&gt;to get worse? Why
&gt;    not take the fight to the oppressors and at least show them that their
&gt;plans will be
&gt;    opposed?
&gt;
&gt;    Winston Churchill said it best:
&gt;
&gt;         "If you will not fight for the right when you can easily win
&gt;without bloodshed,
&gt;         if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not so
&gt;costly, you may
&gt;         come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds
&gt;against you
&gt;         and only a precarious chance for survival. There may be a worse
&gt;case. You
&gt;         may have to fight when there is no chance of victory, because it
&gt;is better to
&gt;         perish than to live as slaves."
