&gt;&gt; It is also likely in the extreme that a working Eternity service will
&gt;&gt; quickly be hit with attackers of various sorts who want to test the limits
&gt;&gt; of the service, or who want such services shut down.
&gt;
&gt;Exactly. When I first talked about Eternity, which was at either the
&gt;1994 or 1995 protocols workshop, I was walking back to my seat when
&gt;Bob Morris (then at the NSA) said, from behind his hand in a stage
&gt;whisper, `Kiddyporn!'
&gt;
&gt;Adam Back added:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the spooks / feds have a history of posting their own child porn if
&gt;&gt; none is available to seize
&gt;
&gt;Indeed, and a decade or so ago there was a scandal when it turned out
&gt;that the spooks were using the Kincora Boys' Home in Belfast as a pedo
&gt;brothel in order to entrap various local politicians. For them to say
&gt;now that they need key escrow to suppress Kiddyporn is a bit rich!
&gt;
&gt;However the main threat is the court order - Anton Pillar or whatever
&gt;- and the best weapon against court orders is anonymity. If they don't
&gt;know your address they can't serve you the order or arrest you for
&gt;contempt.
&gt;
&gt;Tom Womack:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can imagine *use* of the service becoming a felony
&gt;
&gt;I mentioned in the paper that Mossad might deny Eternity service to
&gt;the Muslim world by posting something rude about the Prophet Mohammed.
&gt;
&gt;One must of course create a lawful excuse for people to have Eternity
&gt;software mounted on their system. Maybe in addition to the `public'
&gt;Eternity service we should have many corporate or even private
&gt;services, many of which have escrow capabilities and are thus clearly
&gt;law-abiding and accountable :-)
&gt;
&gt;There are many other possibilities. One topic that oozes into my
&gt;consciousness from time to time is that one might integrate covert
&gt;communications and storage with an anti-spam mail program - maybe a
&gt;natural way forward if Adam hides Eternity traffic in spam!
&gt;
&gt;Tim again:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Great idea, but where are the customers?
&gt;
&gt;Some 90% of security research effort is on confidentiality, 9% on
&gt;authenticity and 1% on availability. Corporate infosec expenditures
&gt;are exactly the other way round, and tools to enable disaster recovery
&gt;databases to be spread holographically over a company's PCs could save
&gt;a fortune compared with the cost of some current arrangements. If a
&gt;few of these backup resources have hidden directories that mount the
&gt;public Eternity service, then who can tell?
&gt;
&gt;At the Info Hiding Workshop at Portland in April, I will present a new
&gt;idea which may facilitate such implementations of Eternity. This is
&gt;the Steganographic File System - designed to provide you with any file
&gt;whose name and password you know. If you don't know this combination,
&gt;then you can't even tell that the file is there. We do not need to
&gt;make any assumptions about tamper resistance; it can be done using
&gt;suitable mathematics. (This is joint work with Roger Needham and Adi
&gt;Shamir.)
&gt;
&gt;Ross
&gt;
&gt;PS: we need a better word for `eternityspace', and Bell Labs have
&gt;already trademarked `Inferno'. So what - Nirvana? Valhalla?
