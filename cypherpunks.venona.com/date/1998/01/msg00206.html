   &gt;   Hi all,

Hi, stranger.

   &gt;   Openworld, Inc. is a company which sets up free enterprise zones around the
   &gt;   world. The "free zones" are akin to Hong Kong and Singapore and are
   &gt;   self-governing, independent entities as recognized by the parent country.
   [snip]
   &gt;   A division of Openworld, Inc., The Digital Society Group, has been formed
   &gt;   to apply technology to the infrastructure of the free zones and essentially
   &gt;   mirror them in cyberspace &lt;argh, the cyber word again&gt;.
   &gt;   
   &gt;   Without getting into too much detail, The Digital Society Group is
   &gt;   constructing a pure-technology infrastructure to provide for the operation,
   &gt;   governance and existence of a complete digital society within a free
   &gt;   enterprise zone.
   [snip]
   &gt;   Locations are planned for Africa, Southeast Asia, Russia, etc.
   &gt;   
   &gt;   We are already coding...

#   I'm bored with the usual run-of-the-mill jobs and am looking for a
#   challenge.  I want to solve problems, find solutions, and create
#   things with computers.
#   
#   My background is in programming/computer security and I have a
#   strong creative talent.
#   
#   My dream is to work in the R&amp;D environment where I can be given
#   a problem/idea and turned loose.

Good boy. Good boy. Stop slobbering on the carpet...

#   I'm looking for webheads, netnerds and arthackers in the Columbus area
#   to form an unstructured group and get a hangout going somewhere in a
#   Columbus coffee-house or something like that.
#    
#   The idea is to throw a bunch of people and some resources together and

#    
#   I have just moved to Columbus from San Diego where this type of thing
#   is a necessity for modern cyberpeople. Since I can't find anything
#   here, I thought I'd get it going myself.
#    
#   If you are interested, mail me and we'll make it happen.
