Alex...here is that E-Mail I got that made me the money to get my new Entertainment system you liked so much. Tell Sarah I said hello, and call me when you get this.

  I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This!!
"I Invested $20 and I'm Going to Europe on My Earnings!"

Hello, Friends!

My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and 
part-time accountant.  As a rule, I ignore all unsolicited
"junk" e-mail and use my account primarily for business. 
I received this very same e-mail countless times and 
deleted it each time.

About two months ago I received it again and, because of 
the catchy subject line,  I finally gave it my attention. 
Afterwards, I thought, "OK, I'm going to try this.  I can
certainly afford to invest $20 and there's nothing wrong 
with creating a little excess cash." I promptly mailed four
$5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend
a small fee to send bulk e-mail for me.  After reading
the reports, I also learned how to advertise for free!

Let me tell you this:  I was not prepared for the results.
Everyday for the last six weeks, my large P.O. box has been 
literally overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess 
fills up an extra mail bin!  I am STUNNED by all the money 
that keeps rolling in!

My husband and I had been trying to save for a down payment
on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with
40% down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!

I promise you, if you follow the steps in this e-mail and
be prepared to set aside about an hour each day to follow
up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much 
money as we did. You don't need to be a whiz at the computer
but I'll bet you already are. If you can open an envelope,
remove the money, and send an e-mail, then you're on your
way to the bank. Read this e-mail a few times so you'll 
understand how easy it is. If I can do this, so can you!

                GO FOR IT NOW!!  IT REALLY WORKS!!

                Karen Liddell

The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
         This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON!!!  
    We suggest you PRINT this letter, read the directions, 
                   THEN READ THEM AGAIN!  
  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $

You are about to embark on the most PROFITABLE and UNIQUE 
program you may ever see.  Many times over, it has proven 
its ability to generate LARGE AMOUNTS of CASH. This program
is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing
on-line population desirous of additional income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It 
does not require you to come in contact with people, do any
selling, and you don't even have to leave the house except 
to get the mail and go to the bank!  

Simply follow the easy instructions in this letter, and 
soon your financial dreams will come true! When followed 
correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program 
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME!

Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc., 

This is your chance, so don't pass it up!

     $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
             OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY  
        ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM    
     $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $

This is what you will do to reach financial freedom:

You will send thousands of people a product for $5.00 which 
costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all 
multi-level businesses, you will increase your business by 
building your downline and selling the products.  Every 
state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level 
business online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business 
reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via 
postal mail will include:

  * $5.00 cash
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will send them the report 
    they ordered.
  * Their postal address (a great way to build a database 
    of opportunity seekers for your future endeavors). 

To fill each order, simply e-mail the product to the buyer.
              THAT'S IT!  THE $5.00 IS YOURS!
This is the EASIEST multi-level marketing business anywhere!

  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
         FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AND BE 
       PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS! 
  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $

   * * * * * I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S * * * * *

1.  Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't 
    sell them if you don't order them).
     
   *  For each of the 4 reports, send $5 CASH ONLY, the NAME and
      NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL
      ADDRESS, and YOUR POSTAL ADDRESS to the person whose
      name is listed under the corresponding report.

   *  Make sure you order each of the 4 reports.  You need
      all 4 reports to save on your computer and resell.

   *  Within 5 to 7 days you will receive, via e-mail, 
      each of the four reports. Save them on your computer
      so they will be accessible for you to send to the 
      thousands of people who will order them from you.

2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
    listed under each report, in any way other than is 
    instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or you will 
    lose out on the majority of your profit. Once you 
    understand how this program works, you'll also see how 
    it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method
    has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, take this 
        advertisement and remove the name and address under 
        REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle
        and is no doubt counting their 50 grand!

    c.  Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to
        REPORT #4.  

    d.  Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to 
        REPORT #3.

    e.  Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to
        REPORT #2.

    f.  Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.

  =3D=3D&gt; Please copy all names and addresses ACCURATELY!!! &lt;=3D=3D

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of
    names, and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes 
    to the instruction portion of this letter.
  
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on 
    the WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very 
    inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places
    to advertise. Another avenue which you could use for 
    advertising is investing in bulk e-mail services by
    paying someone a minimal charge to advertise for you. 

5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail
    them the report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS 
    PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This will 
    guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name
    and address on it, will be prompt because they can't
    advertise until they receive the report!

 ***************************************************************
                  AVAILABLE REPORTS    
             Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME 
 ***************************************************************
Notes:
-  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (NO CHECKS) FOR EACH REPORT
-  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at 
   least two sheets of paper  
-  On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the number
   &amp; name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail 
   address, and (c) your postal address.  It is suggested 
   that you rent a mailbox addressed to an assumed "company"
   name to avoid your name and home address being sent to
   millions of people. For an example, see the "company" 
   names listed below.

 HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$ 
$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $=
 $ $

Let's say you start small just to see how it works. Assume 
your goal is to get 10 people on your first level. (Placing
a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger
response.) Also assume that everyone in YOUR ORGANIZATION 
gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example to 
achieve the STAGGERING results below.

Level 1: your 10 members with $5. . . . . . . . . . . . .$50
Level 2: 10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100). . . . . . $500
Level 3: 10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000). . . .$5,000
Level 4: 10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000). .$50,000
                      THIS TOTALS    -----------&gt;    $55,550

Remember: this assumes that the people who participate only
recruit 10 people each.  Think what will happen when they 
get 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of 
participants!  THINK ABOUT IT!!!

       $   TIPS FOR YOUR SUCCESS   $
       $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, 
  and follow the directions accurately.

* Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have 
  them when the orders start coming in because:

     When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send the report
     to comply with U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title 18,
     Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in
     the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, 
     Sections 255 and 436, which state that "a product or 
     service must be exchanged for money received."

* Be patient and persistent! Follow the steps exactly and
  you WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!

* HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

       $   YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE    $
       $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $

=3D=3D&gt; Follow these guidelines to GUARANTEE YOUR SUCCESS &lt;=3D=3D

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within 2 weeks,
keep advertising until you do.  Then, 2 weeks later, if you
receive less than 100 orders for REPORT #2, keep advertising
until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for
REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already 
working for you, and the $$CASH$$ will continue to roll in!

   =3D=3D&gt; HOW YOU WILL KNOW THE PROGRAM IS WORKING &lt;=3D=3D

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are 
placed under a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of 
your progress by watching which report people are ordering 
from you.  If you want to generate more income, send 
another batch of your advertisement (with you in the #1 
position) and start the process again!  There is no limit 
to the income you will generate from this business!

   This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a 
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of 
potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It 
is a great opportunity to make very easy money, with little
investment.  If you participate, follow the program exactly
and you'll be on your way to financial security.
          Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS

     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in 
Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. 
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received 
the program I grumbled to Doris about "junk mail." I made 
fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the 
population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't 
work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and 
jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and 
was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the 
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within 
two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 
days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was 
shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it
wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in
her "hobby."   I did have seven more years until retirement,
but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it
all to MLM.
           Frank T., Bel-Air, MD

    The main reason for this letter is to tell you that 
this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is
a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was
approached several times before I checked this out. I 
joined just to see what one could expect in return for the
minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I 
received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still
coming in.
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.

    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks
to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But being 
conservative, I decided that the initial investment was so 
little that there was no way that I wouldn't get enough 
orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised
when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with 
orders!  For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to 
start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more 
money this year than any 10 years of my life before. There 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
         Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

This is my third time to participate in this plan. My 
wife and I have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home at 
the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The 
only way this plan will work for you is if you do it. For 
your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this 
opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
