STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Kuwait
============================================================
Kuwait - Public Announcement
 February 6, 1998

On February 5, 1998, the American Embassy in Kuwait was authorized 
to issue the following warden message:

"We are monitoring the situation with Iraq closely.  Although we 
see no direct threat to the safety of American citizens in Kuwait at 
this time, we believe it would be prudent now for all citizens to 
heed the standing preparedness advice for American citizens living 
abroad.  Specifically, you should:

--assemble all vital documents such as passports, birth and 
marriage records, vaccination, insurance and bank records in one 
readily accessible location;

--check to be sure that your passport and any necessary visas are 
valid and that you are registered at the Embassy with your current 
address and phone number.  If you need to obtain a new passport or 
to update your registration, please do so at the Embassy as soon as 
possible, any working day from 8:30 to 11:30 am or 1:00 to 3:00 pm;

--make or update as necessary a complete inventory of your 
household effects, in duplicate;

--maintain an adequate supply of food and water in your home.  Make 
sure your car is in good working order.  Keep the gas tank full and 
check oil, coolant, tires and battery.

We do not want American citizens in Kuwait to become unduly 
alarmed.  These are precautionary measures only.  We are not 
advising Americans to leave.  However, given the potential 
seriousness of the current situation we believe it is important for 
all citizens to maintain readiness in case of an emergency.  We will 
promptly inform you of any significant developments and advise you 
accordingly."

For further information on travel to Kuwait, please consult the 
latest Consular Information Sheet for Kuwait or contact the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait.  This Public Announcement expires May 6, 1998.


Kuwait - Consular Information Sheet
 August 28, 1996

Country Description:  Kuwait is a constitutional monarchy with a 
modern economy.  Day-to-day life has returned to normal after the 
1991 Gulf War, and facilities for travelers are widely available.  
The workweek in Kuwait is Saturday through Wednesday.

Entry Requirements:  Passports and visas are required for U.S. 
citizens traveling to Kuwait.  For more information concerning entry 
requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of Kuwait at 2940 
Tilden St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 966-0702, 
or the Kuwaiti Consulate in New York City, telephone (212) 973-4318.

Areas of Instability:  Travel to and near the Iraq-Kuwait border is 
very hazardous.  U.S. citizens having legitimate work-related 
business near the border may receive updated information from the 
U.S. Embassy, and may also wish to consult with their employer's 
security personnel.  Unexploded bombs, mines, booby traps, and other 
items remain in open areas and beaches throughout Kuwait.  U.S. 
Embassy personnel have been forbidden to travel off paved surfaces 
outside Kuwait City.

Medical Facilities:  The health care delivery system continues to 
rebuild, with many medical facilities, both government and private, 
available in Kuwait.  Medical care at government-run clinics and 
hospitals is generally provided free of charge or at low cost to 
residents of Kuwait, while private physicians and hospitals charge a 
fee for services.  Non-residents have found that private doctors, 
hospitals and clinics expect immediate cash payment for their 
services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the 
United States.  Medevac insurance, for emergencies requiring 
treatment outside Kuwait, and supplemental medical insurance with 
specific overseas coverage have proven useful.  Additional 
information on health matters can be obtained from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers hotline, 
telephone (404) 332-4559 or visit the CDC Home Page on the Internet 
at <A  HREF="http://www.cdc.gov">http://www.cdc.gov</A>.

Crime Information:  The crime rate in Kuwait is moderate.  However, 
weapons left over from the 1991 Gulf War remain in the hands of the 
populace, and shooting incidents have occurred,  Both physical and 
verbal harassment of women is a continuing problem.  The loss or 
theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported immediately to 
local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  Useful 
information on safeguarding valuables, protecting personal security, 
and other matters while traveling abroad is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to the Middle East and North Africa."  They are available 
from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

Currency Regulations:  Travelers checks and credit cards are widely 
acceptable.  Kuwaiti currency is readily convertible to U.S. dollars.

Drug and Crime Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of 
the country in which they are traveling.  Alcohol, pork products, 
and pornography are illegal in Kuwait.  Penalties for importation, 
possession, use, manufacture or sale of illegal drugs, alcohol, or 
pornography are severe, and convicted offenders can expect jail 
sentences and fines.  Religious proselytizing is not permitted.

Terrorist Activities:  Americans in Kuwait should be alert to their 
surroundings and take prudent security precautions.  U.S. citizens 
may wish to consult the Department of State or the U.S. Embassy for 
updated information.

Child Custody:  In Kuwait, child custody decisions are based on 
Islamic law.  It is extremely difficult for an American woman, even 
a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a Kuwaiti court 
decision.  Regardless of their parents' marital status, minor 
children of a Kuwaiti father may not leave Kuwait without the 
father's permission.

Traffic Safety and Road Conditions:  Driving in Kuwait can be 
hazardous.  Although Kuwait has an extensive and modern system of 
well-lighted roads, excessive speeding on both primary and secondary 
roads, coupled with lax enforcement of traffic regulations, lead to 
frequent and often fatal accidents.

Embassy Location and Registration:  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register at the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy and to enroll 
in the Embassy's emergency alert network, and to obtain updated 
information on travel and security in Kuwait.  The U.S. Embassy in 
Kuwait is located at Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa Street, Plot 14, Block 14, 
Bayan, Kuwait.  The mailing address is P.O. Box 77, Safat 13001, 
Kuwait; telephone (965) 242-4151 through 9.

 No. 96-150

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet for Kuwait dated 
September 20, 1994, to update information on areas of instability, 
drug and crime penalties, terrorist activities, and the address of 
the U.S. Embassy, and to add information on child custody and 
traffic safety and road conditions.
