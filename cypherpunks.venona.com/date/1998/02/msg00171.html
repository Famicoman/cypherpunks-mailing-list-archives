&gt;    John Ousterhout leaves SunScript Contributed by CmdrTaco on Thu Feb 5
&gt;    23:38:53 1998 EST
&gt;    [Sun Microsystems] From the other-disappearing-acts Dept
&gt;    Markus Fleck (aka python) wrote in to say "John Ousterhout, author of
&gt;    the Tcl language and the Tk toolkit, also of Spring OS fame, has left
&gt;    SunScript to form his own company, called Scriptics, to promote the
&gt;    use and further development of Tcl. - I suppose that Sun didn't find
&gt;    paying for Tcl development worthwhile any more, because there has
&gt;    hardly been any revenue from it yet (even the source for the Tcl
&gt;    Plugin for web browsers was made freely available when a poll showed
&gt;    that too few people would be willing to pay for being able to execute
&gt;    "Tclets" in their browsers)."

&gt;    Be x86 Coming Contributed by CmdrTaco
&gt;    [Be] Thu Feb 5 16:26:43 1998 EST
&gt;    From the mr-be-sharp dept.
&gt;    Sean Simmons wrote in to tell us that BeOS for x86 should be released
&gt;    at SD98. Check out this TechWeb Story for more details. I would love
&gt;    to get my hands on a copy.

&gt;    Should Netscape Sell Linux? Contributed by Justin
&gt;    [Netscape] Thu Feb 5 16:11:27 1998 EST
&gt;    From the not-a-bad-idea dept.
&gt;    An article at the Boston Globe presents an interesting solution to
&gt;    Netscape's recent losses in the browser war. The author suggests
&gt;    Netscape create and sell their own Linux distribution, the reason
&gt;    being that Microsoft will be able to leverage their control of the
&gt;    operating system for some time. Read on.

&gt;    2600 In Danger Contributed by CmdrTaco
&gt;    Thu Feb 5 10:56:14 1998 EST
&gt;    From the sounds-familiar dept.
&gt;    I)ruid wrote in to say " 2600 The Hacker Quarterly, has recently been
&gt;    having financial problems due to it's previous distributor. To find
&gt;    out the whole story, check out this page. 2600 needs our help, but
&gt;    will not accept donations. However, there is a LOT of merchandice in
&gt;    stock, and buying up their overstock will definately help, as well as
&gt;    going down to your local bookstore and requesting that they carry
&gt;    2600. So if you appreciate 2600 as much as I do, let's help give them
&gt;    the help they need." My sentiments exactly.

&gt;    Cooking pot markets Contributed by CmdrTaco
&gt;    Thu Feb 5 10:27:02 1998 EST
&gt;    From the must-read dept.
&gt;    Hackworth sent us a link to an article entitled Cooking pot markets.
&gt;    The article is an extremely good read, and addresses issues like What
&gt;    Motiviates Free Software guys. I suspect most of us free software guys
&gt;    already know what is said here, but this article puts it very clearly
&gt;    for people who might understand it a bit less can be clued it.

&gt;    Des2, Bovine and Slashdot Contributed by CmdrTaco
&gt;    [Encryption] Thu Feb 5 10:09:40 1998 EST
&gt;    From the bits-and-bytes dept.
&gt;    Distributed.net has been working hard to crack the Des2 contest inside
&gt;    the 22 day limit, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen,
&gt;    despite Team Slashdot's rising in the ranks to #13. Thanks to the
&gt;    125-150 of you who have been contributing keys in our name!

&gt;    
&gt;    Read Rob's Solution to the Browser Battle and a followup with comments
&gt;    from a Netscape Engineer. Interesting especially now that Netscape
&gt;    Agreed!
