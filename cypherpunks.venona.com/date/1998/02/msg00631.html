THIS EMAIL IS INTENDED FOR ADULT WEBMASTERS WHO HAVE SIGNED UP
FOR OUR MAILING LIST

Hi from Dean at Playgal,

I have sent this email to advise you of a major change and opportunity. As
you may be aware both Intertain ( the nets first paysite ) and Playgal have
formed a partnership. Together we form one of the largest adult networks on
the Internet - our newly formed operation is Intergal.

We have now combined our click through programs and launched the new
Intergal advertising programs. We have a unique hit based click through
which will guarantee a minimum payout <A  HREF="http://www.intergal.com/nfa">http://www.intergal.com/nfa</A> and
offers huge conversion rate bonuses which means you can earn up to $5 a
unique hit. 

Or we have the no frills NO FUCKING ABOUT campaign IN THE RAW - the click
through which pays you 5.5 cents a raw hit - no conversion rates, just good
old RAW hits. <A  HREF="http://www.intergal.com/nfa/nfa.html">http://www.intergal.com/nfa/nfa.html</A>

You can select from our banner farm or use your own banners - we allow text
links. It is up to you to send us as much traffic as possible - we
encourage you to do it. Please feel free to use any marketing initiative
you wish to maximize traffic sent to our sites - we understand the fact
that you know your sites better than us . ( virtually the only thing we
dont approve of is cheating ).

We have one of the highest raw hit counts of any click through on the net -
undisputed. We dont filter hits ! 

A great suppliment to your Intergal program is to advertise the nets newest
and freshest site <A  HREF="http://www.unfaithful.com">http://www.unfaithful.com</A> you can sign up for the click
through at <A  HREF="http://www.unfaithful.com/easycash">http://www.unfaithful.com/easycash</A> .
