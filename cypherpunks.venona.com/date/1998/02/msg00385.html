Outside of Birmingham, a kid was arrested Saturday for not giving a cop
his Social Security number. The bumper fell off his truck, so he stuck the
tag in the rear window; not a rare sight in Alabama. He got pulled over
for it. Alabama licenses have the holder's SSN on them (because that way
the state gets more Federal highway $), except his parents had never
applied to get him one, because of their religion. When the cop demanded
his SSN ("Deine Papieren!"), and he didn't tell him one, he was arrested
for disorderly conduct. He's still in jail because in order to bail him
out his parents had to supply their (guess what) SSNs.

Clinton recently declared his intention to use his supposed budget surplus
to save Social Security. In order to maintain Social Security payments, it
is estimated that combined Federal taxes will have to rise to 84% of
national income! Social Security is doomed as a retiremant option; there
is no reason for any able bodied citizen born after 1950 to ever expect to
see any benefits from it. So why should any of those people have SSNs?
Because securing retirement is not the real goal of Social Security.
However, it is still quite valuable as a means for tracking and
controlling people, and it looks like voluntary compliance is now being
strictly enforced. That's why Clinton wants to save Social Security.
