&gt;    Bringing you the latest news from the Linux World.
&gt;    Dedicated to keeping Linux users up-to-date, with concise news for all
&gt;    interests

&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt; Leading items
&gt; 
&gt;    This is going to be the year of free software. I have honestly come to
&gt;    believe that. The free software movement is about to make tremendous
&gt;    gains in respect and mindshare in realms where it has long been
&gt;    ignored. Big software firms may want to start worrying, because the
&gt;    world is changing around them.
&gt;    
&gt;    Anybody who didn't read Eric S. Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar
&gt;    paper should go and do so now. It describes the Linux development
&gt;    model nicely, as well as the reasons for the success of that model.
&gt;    Netscape has credited this paper with being a crucial influence in
&gt;    their decision to free the source to their browser.
&gt;    
&gt;    As of this writing, Eric is evidently in Silicon Valley discussing
&gt;    licensing terms with Netscape. The word is that he is also meeting
&gt;    with several other "leading Silicon Valley CEO's" to discuss the free
&gt;    software model. One wonders who else may decide to adopt the bazaar
&gt;    model of development.
&gt;    
&gt;    Whether or not other firms follow Netscape in the near future, free
&gt;    software now has a visibility that was lacking before. Peruse the set
&gt;    of articles listed below, and you'll see what we mean. This can only
&gt;    be good for the Linux world, as the validity of its model of
&gt;    development gains the recognition it deserves. It's looking like
&gt;    interesting times.
&gt;    
&gt;    David Miller, the force behind the Sparc and SGI ports, finally
&gt;    resurfaced after a longish, low-profile period. To see what he has
&gt;    been doing, check out the Cobalt Micro page. I don't know anybody who
&gt;    has actually run one of these cool, blue Linux boxes, but they look
&gt;    like a fun toy...
&gt;    
&gt;    Does unix need to be rescued from the hackers?. This item isn't
&gt;    particularly new, but Michael Hoffman's article on the need for a
&gt;    seamless graphical user interface for unix systems is still good food
&gt;    for thought. Another person, Perry Harrington, would like to replace
&gt;    the X window system with something better, and which would include a
&gt;    serious user interface policy. See his page if you would like to
&gt;    participate.

&gt;    
&gt; Linux in the news
&gt; 
&gt;    Wired news ran an article on free software last week. The obvious
&gt;    point of interest was Netscape, but Linux rated some favorable mention
&gt;    as well. It's a reasonable discussion of the merits of free software
&gt;    in general.
&gt;    
&gt;    Accolades from the Emerald Isle. An article in the Irish Times
&gt;    financial section is also favorable toward Linux, explicitly as an
&gt;    alternative to NT. I assume that "Linux remains at the coalface
&gt;    technologically [...]" is a positive thing...
&gt;    
&gt;    There is a four-part series on free software in news.com this week.
&gt;    It's a reasonably good and sympathetic series, despite its title:
&gt;    "Socialist Software."
&gt;    
&gt;    Many of us have heard the old argument: "There is no technical support
&gt;    for Linux." Well, then, why has Infoworld awarded its 1997 technical
&gt;    support award to the Linux community? It's a great bit of recognition
&gt;    that just because software is free doesn't mean that it's unsupported.
&gt;    Show this one to your boss.
&gt;    
&gt;    Ah yes, and their award for operating systems went to Red Hat 5.0...
&gt;    
&gt;    Two other articles in Infoworld: Nicolas Petreley thinks that
&gt;    Netscape's move could be a winning strategy, while Mark Tebbe talks of
&gt;    the model used by "a renegade OS such as Linux" and raises, you
&gt;    guessed it, the spectre of support.
&gt;    
&gt;    "[Linux] is emerging as a viable competitor to Microsoft's Windows NT"
&gt;    according to an article in the New York Times. Note that this site
&gt;    requires registration now... The old convention of using 'cypherpunks'
&gt;    for the username and password will get you in, if you don't wish to
&gt;    register separately.
&gt;    
&gt;    The folks at TBTF ran a couple of Linux-related articles this week.
&gt;    One, dedicated to estimating the size of the Linux community, comes up
&gt;    with 5-7 million installed Linux systems in the world.
&gt;    
&gt;    We are told January's issue of Sky &amp; Telescope has a nice Linux
&gt;    article in it. We haven't seen it, though; check your local newsstand.
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;    CNN's article on top selling software for January includes a reference
&gt;    to Red Hat Linux. It's number three in the "Business Software
&gt;    (MS-DOS/OS/2)" section. "Business software" can almost make sense, but
&gt;    "MS-DOS"???        [Security] A serious X-windows security problem has
&gt;    been reported in XKB, depending on X11 version and environment, which
&gt;    can allow local users to exploit a "feature" XDB to execute arbitrary
&gt;    programs with extra privileges. Quick vulnerability check and fix are
&gt;    provided in the posting to linux-alert. You can also see Red Hat's
&gt;    advisory on this bug.
&gt;    
&gt;    The AT&amp;T Crowds project has chosen linux for their next target. Crowds
&gt;    is intended to protect a person's anonymity as they browse the web and
&gt;    already runs under SunOS, Solaris and Irix.
&gt;    
&gt;    The filter program that comes as part of the elm-2.4 package contains
&gt;    two vulnerabilities, one of which could be remotely exploited. Details
&gt;    here.
&gt;    
&gt;    Michal Zalewski reported a problem with gzexe, part of the gzip
&gt;    package. Seems it uses predictable filenames in /tmp, which may allow
&gt;    users to destroy the contents of files on your system. Use of gzexe is
&gt;    not widespread, but Red Hat recommends upgrading your version of gzip.
&gt;           [Kernel] The current development kernel version is 2.1.85. It
&gt;    includes the ability to boot off of MD striped disks, a bunch of SCSI
&gt;    changes for machines with the IBM MCA bus, bug fixes, and
&gt;    documentation updates. Thus far, reported problems are few, though
&gt;    there are evidently some build problems with the MCA SCSI stuff.
&gt;    
&gt;    Alan Cox states that TCP is "somewhat broken" in the 2.1.8x series,
&gt;    "and will remain so until it's fixed." As always with development
&gt;    kernels, be careful out there. Patches continue to roll in towards a
&gt;    (still somewhat distant) 2.2 release.
&gt;    
&gt;    A stated goal, once development starts on 2.3, is reworking and
&gt;    cleaning up the sound driver code. Some of you may have noticed that
&gt;    it can be a bit, um, difficult to configure and make work right. It's
&gt;    not clear how that development will proceed, but Colin Plumb posted a
&gt;    good, concise article on some of the issues involved.
&gt;    
&gt;    Richard Gooch continues to update his enhancements. The MTRR patch
&gt;    (MTRR stands for Memory Type Range Registers - now we all understand,
&gt;    right?), which greatly speeds frame buffer access, is up to rev 1.8
&gt;    (against kernel 2.1.84). His "devfs" patch (runtime creation of the
&gt;    /dev tree) is up to version 18. Both are available from his patch
&gt;    page. Still no word on when (or if) these patches will go into the
&gt;    2.1 kernel.
&gt;    
&gt;    Unless you have a multiprocessor machine, be sure not to compile your
&gt;    kernels with SMP enabled. Recent development kernels seem to be even
&gt;    less than usually forgiving in this regard; SMP kernels on a
&gt;    uniprocessor machine can die in weird and unpleasant ways.
&gt;    Unfortunately, SMP is still the default, and is not a configuration
&gt;    option; you need to edit the Makefile and comment out the SMP = 1 line
&gt;    near the beginning. Believe me (voice of experience here) it's an easy
&gt;    thing to forget...
&gt;    
&gt;    Also in the SMP arena is a flurry of activity around IO-APIC use. The
&gt;    IO-APIC is an interrupt controller on multiprocessor systems which is
&gt;    able to route interrupts to any CPU, thus helping to create a true
&gt;    symmetric multiprocessing system. However, each motherboard seems to
&gt;    do it a little different, leading to one of those bits of hardware
&gt;    obnoxiousness that takes a long time to sort out. The 2.1.85 kernel
&gt;    added a document describing IO-APIC for those interested in the
&gt;    details.
&gt;    
&gt;    Is the Linux Maintenance Project dead? The question was raised this
&gt;    week, since the web pages have not been updated in recent times. The
&gt;    answer is that the maintainer is busy, and some new ways of running
&gt;    the web pages are being worked out. Expect some activity there in the
&gt;    not-too-distant future.
&gt;    
&gt;    William Stearns is working on a program to automate the process of
&gt;    building a new kernel. Check out his web page for more info. Since
&gt;    we're a weekly publication, chances are we'll be behind a rev or two
&gt;    on the kernel release by the time you read this page. Up-to-the-second
&gt;    information can always be found at LinuxHQ.      [DISTRIBUTIONS] 
&gt;    
&gt; Debian
&gt; 
&gt;    Yes, it's true! Debian is dumping dselect! From the recent mention on
&gt;    debian-announce, the new package manager meant to replace dselect is
&gt;    now being demonstrated and will probably appear in 2.1 or one of the
&gt;    early point releases.
&gt;    
&gt;    Mentioned recently on debian-announce, a Debian system was used to
&gt;    develop the AMSAT Phase 3-D satellite, one of the series of Ham Radio
&gt;    Satellites. Check it out here.
&gt;    
&gt;    A reminder to frustrated Debian users who are only finding their
&gt;    favorite software in RPM format: "alien" can be used instead. If you
&gt;    have trouble with alien, try upgrading to debianutils 1.6.
&gt;    
&gt;    The January issue of the German magazine CHIP Extra comes with a
&gt;    CD-ROM containing Debian 1.3.1 and the Beta version of StarOffice 4.0
&gt;    for Linux. Review from debian-user indicates that the issue is very
&gt;    well done, with a lot of useful info for both novices and users.
&gt;    Here's CHIP's Web site, primarily in German.
&gt;    
&gt; Red Hat
&gt; 
&gt;    Red Hat reports recent turn-over in their support staff which has hurt
&gt;    the Red Hat installation support they provide via e-mail to people who
&gt;    purchase their $50 set. They "have been working to midnight and
&gt;    beyond" to catch up with the backload and have hired new staff. Robert
&gt;    Hart (Red Hat's support manager) assured people on redhat-list that
&gt;    Red Hat installation support will not be terminated at 30 days if a
&gt;    delay on their part caused the time to run out.
&gt;    
&gt;    Red Hat 5.0 users have also been griping a bit about how the errata
&gt;    pages are handled. Complaints include slow updates, and Red Hat's
&gt;    tendency to update existing entries, making it very hard to notice a
&gt;    second update for a given package. A call was made for public
&gt;    announcements from Red Hat whenever updates go out.
&gt;    
&gt;    Users on redhat-list have been poking at
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/IE4mk/">http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/IE4mk/</A>, finding that
&gt;    accessing it from Netscape 4.04 crashes some Xservers, and not others,
&gt;    depending on your Xserver and Linux version. No direct link is
&gt;    provided, on-purpose, but feel free to check it out!.
&gt;    
&gt;    Off-topic, but on the redhat-list, Dave Wreski compiled and posted a
&gt;    list of free ssh-clients for Windows. He would like to see people
&gt;    choose one, try it out and post a review, since interest in them is so
&gt;    high.
&gt;    
&gt; Slackware
&gt; 
&gt;    Reported on bugtraq: Imapd/ipop3d problems in slackware 3.4 if you
&gt;    install the pine package. When fed an unknown username, imapd and
&gt;    ipop3d will dump core. Details here. Patrick Volkerding [maintainer of
&gt;    Slackware] has already responded and will put out a repaired package.
&gt;    
&gt; S.u.S.E
&gt; 
&gt;    For the Linux trivia buffs, S.u.S.E stands for 'Software und System
&gt;    Entwicklung', which means software and system development. If you're
&gt;    interested in S.u.S.E's history, check out this post from Bodo Bauer.
&gt;    
&gt;    How do you pronounce S.u.S.E? A popular Americanism is "Suzie", but if
&gt;    you ask in Germany, the pronunciation will be closer to "Seuss-eh" (as
&gt;    in Doctor Seuss) or "Souss-uh". Boy was it fun to watch people try and
&gt;    describe a sound in an e-mail message!
&gt;    
&gt;    There are a lot of converts from various Unix flavors on the
&gt;    suse-linux-e list (of course!). If you're interested in comments from
&gt;    one person who recently installed the distribution, check it out.
&gt;      [Ports] 
&gt;    
&gt; Alpha
&gt; 
&gt;    At least one Linux system vendor (Net Express) has stopped selling
&gt;    Alpha-based systems as a result of the Compaq takeover of Digital. See
&gt;    their Alpha systems page for details on their reasoning. On the other
&gt;    hand, most other vendors and the Alpha discussion lists remain
&gt;    relatively calm on this subject, suggesting that not everybody is
&gt;    worried.
&gt;    
&gt;    There is an article in SunWorld Online about the Compaq takeover. No
&gt;    real conclusions, but they raise some concerns.
&gt;    
&gt; Sparc
&gt; 
&gt;    People are already asking whether SPARC/Linux will run on the new,
&gt;    PCI-based Ultra workstations. No definitive answer has been posted,
&gt;    but it seems awfully unlikely. The new bus, new video, and (oh joy)
&gt;    IDE disks are all stuff that SPARC/Linux has never had to deal with
&gt;    before.  /td&gt;      [Software Development] Almost overnight, the
&gt;    linux-ha (linux high-availability list) has revived and is generating
&gt;    good discussion! If you are interested in high-availability Linux
&gt;    solutions, now is the time to get involved! You can subscribe to
&gt;    linux-ha on the Linux Mailing Lists page.
&gt;    
&gt;           [Articles] Some folks are discovering they can no longer access
&gt;    hosts with underscores in their names. Host names with underscores
&gt;    have always been against the rules, but many systems have let them
&gt;    work anyway. However, the new GNU C library, shipping with the latest
&gt;    Linux distributions, enforces this rule. If you have host names with
&gt;    _underscores_, you might want to consider renaming them soon.
&gt;    
&gt;    Want to run Oracle 7.3.3 under Linux? Jan Andersen posted a detailed
&gt;    howto describing the path to there using the IBCS package.
&gt;    
&gt;    If you see these errors from Netscape Communicator 4.04:
&gt;    
&gt;      sh: -c line 1: missing closing `)' for arthmetic expression sh: -1
&gt;      line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `;' sh: -c line 1:
&gt;      `((/usr/local/bin/rvplayer /tmp/MO34B2F4B209B0136.ram); rm /tmp/\
&gt;      MO34B2F4B209B0136.ram )&amp;'
&gt;      
&gt;    your problem is actually probably your version of bash. Try upgrading
&gt;    to the latest version (2.01) to fix the problem.
