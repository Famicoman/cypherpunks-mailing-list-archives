I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:

                    I Actually Read a Piece of E-Mail & I'm Going to
Europe on the Proceeds!


Hello!

My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and part-time
accountant. As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk"
e-mail and use my account primarily for business. I received what I
assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted
it each time.

About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy
subject line, I finally read it. Afterwards, I thought , "OK,
I give in, I'm going to try this. I can certainly afford to invest $20
and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a
little excess cash." I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after
receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out
some e-mail advertisements for me. After reading the reports, I also
learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for
free! 

I was not prepared for the results. Everyday for the last six weeks, my
P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days
the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the
corporate-size box! I am stunned by all the money that
keeps rolling in!

My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a
substantial downpayment on a house. Now, not only are we
purchasing a house with 40% down, we're going to Venice, Italy to
celebrate!

I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be
prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to
follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money
as we did. You don't need to be a wiz at the
computer, but I'll bet you already are. If you can open an envelope,
remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then
you're on your way to the bank. Take the time to read this so you'll
understand how easy it is. If I can do this, so can you!

GO FOR IT NOW!!

Karen Liddell
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:


              
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

                         This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
                      PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ
IT AGAIN !!!


You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you
may ever see. Many times over, it has demonstrated
and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash. This program
is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and
ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity. It does not
require you to come in contact with people, do any hard
work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get
the mail and go to the bank! 

"This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for! Simply follow
the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial
dreams can come true! When followed correctly, this electronic,
multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100%
EVERY TIME!"

Thousands of people have used this program to:
- Raise capital to start their own business
- Pay off debts
- Buy homes, cars, etc., 
- Even retire! 

"This is your chance, so don't pass it up!"

                
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
                        ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
                
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to
nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level
businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and
selling our products. Every state in the U.S. allows you to
recruit new multi- level business online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business and
financial reports costing $5.00 each. Each order you receive via
"snail mail" will include:

* $5.00 cash
* The name and number of the report they are ordering
* The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer. THAT'S
IT! The $5.00 is yours! This is the EASIEST
electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! 

                         FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
                       BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!

                               ******* I N S T R U C T I O N S *******


This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if
you don't order them).

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose 
name appears on the list next to the report.

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four
reports. You will need all four reports so that you can save them
on your computer and resell them.

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four
reports. 
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send 
to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is
instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out on the
majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you'll 
also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method 
has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

a. Look below for the listing of available reports.

b. After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address 
under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the one that 
was there down to REPORT #2. 

c. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
REPORT #3. 

d. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
REPORT #4. 

e. The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
the list and has NO DOUBT collected a very large sum of money.

                   Please make sure you copy everyone's name and
address ACCURATELY!!!


3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and
save 
it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this 
letter.

4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
WORLDWIDE WEB! Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another
avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists. 
You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you
can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. 
BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
report
they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out,
with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't
advertise until they receive the report!

                       ***Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***


Notes:
- ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT 
- ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL 
- Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper 
- On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the number & name of
the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address,
and (c) your postal address.

                               HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS 
                            AMAZING PLAN CAN MAKE YOU $MONEY$
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works.
Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your
first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get
a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in
YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to
achieve the STAGGERING results
below.

1st level--your 10 members with
$5...........................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
THIS TOTALS ----------->$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only
recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would
happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants! THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can
afford $20). You obviously already have an internet
connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT#3 shows you the most productive
methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing
e-mail lists. Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!

             About 250,000 new people get online every month, just on
one service alone!

                              *******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******


* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow 
the directions accurately.

* Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when 
the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title
18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state 
that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!


                            *******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******


Here are some guidelines to follow that can better guarantee your
success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising until you do. Then, a couple of
weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2. If
you don't, continue advertising until you do. Once you
have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because
the system is already working for you, and
the cash will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front
of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK
of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.
If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails (500,000 or more) and start the whole process
again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business! You can also ask a qualified bulk e-mailer
for tips on what is working the best. Find out if he or
she is participating in the pro
gram.

NOTE: If you need help with starting a business, registering a business
name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the
Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and
answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free
help
via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.

                            *******T E S T I M O N I A L S*******


This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't
work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that
it works. It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy
money, with
little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. 
Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS

My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a
cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good
money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving
"junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge
of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work.
Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I
told you so" on her wh
en the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received
over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all
figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined
Doris in
her "hobby." I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think
of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.
Frank T., Bel-Air, MD

I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you. Any
doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even
checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It
definitely is! IT WORKS!!!
Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large
amount of
money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked
this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received
$36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided
that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I
surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with
orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up
my
mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of
my life
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where
in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment
with a
faster return.
Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered
if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to
contact to
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another
program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I
made more
than $41,000 on the first try!!
D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our
jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest
on our
money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you
do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this
golden
opportunity. Good luck and happy spending!
