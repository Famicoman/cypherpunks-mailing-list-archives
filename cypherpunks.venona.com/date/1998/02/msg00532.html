    let's put the Saddam affair in perspective; I'm sure anyone 
    who is generally enlightened will agree that Bubba needs a
    nice little war to distract attention from his impending 
    doom from a wandering dickhead which Hillary obviously does 
    not, and has not, serviced adequately. 

    Eric Margolis, whom I have known for many years, is an
    American, and a Vietnam veteran, on the staff of the Toronto
    Sun, who went to Canada for editorial freedom. he calls it
    like he sees it, and the following article on American's
    failed MidEast foreign policy since WWII should be must
    reading for the war mongers who have never learned their 
    history and are about to repeat it.

                         NOT SO FAST, SEN. LOTT!
                             by Eric Margolis
                             Toronto Sun Editorial Columnist
                             February 16, 1998

Senate majority leader Trent Lott and other senior Republicans
are demanding the US adopt a long-term strategy of covert action
and subversion to overthrow Saddam Hussein and other Mideast
troublemakers who disturb the Pax Americana.

Bombing Iraq is simply not enough, warned war-fevered
Republicans.  Saddam must be driven from power once and for all.
Many pro-Israel Conservatives demand the US Army march on
Baghdad.

If Senator Lott knew Mideast history better, he might not be so
eager for covert action, or hopeful Iraq's government could be
overthrown to America's profit.  He might even learn the United
States is not the solution to the Mideast's chronic instability
and tensions, but a major source.  A few examples:

*1947 

Washington is displeased by Syria's government.  A CIA-Army
`political action team' mounts a coup, employing a `CIA asset,'
Gen. Husni Za'im.  As senior CIA Mideast agent Miles Copeland
delightfully recalls, the Americans kept calling Za'im `our
boy,' or `Husni,' and ordering him about.  The day after Za'im's
coup, Copeland and the American agents went to inform the new
dictator whom he would appoint as ambassadors and cabinet
ministers.  When the Americans called him, `Husni,' Za'im
ordered them to `stand at attention,' and address him as
`Excellency.'  US-Syrian relations have been terrible ever
since.  Two subsequent, US-backed coups backfired.

*1952

The US helps engineer a coup against British puppet ruler of
Egypt, King Farouk.  CIA backs a young colonel, Gammal Abdel
Nasser.  But when the US later tries to pressure Nasser into
joining Washington's `new order' for the Mideast, the Baghdad
Pact, Nasser rebels and becomes America's enemy number one.  CIA
tries first to overthrow, than assassinate Nasser.  All attempts
fail.

*1953

Iran's popular, elected leader, Mohammed Mossadegh, attempts to
assert Iranian control of his nation's oil industry, whose
profits go to the US and Britain.  A CIA coup overthrows
Mossadegh, and puts `our boy' Reza Shah on the throne.  Iran's
US-trained secret police keep the Shah in power through a reign
of terror.  Islamic-nationalist revolution sweeps Iran in 1979,
ending US domination.

*1957/58

US and Britain thwart popular uprisings against King Hussein of
Jordan.

*1958 

Washington installs a client regime in Lebanon, which then
dutifully calls for US troops.  Beginning of Lebanon's 35 years
of instability and civil war.

*1958

Britain's Iraqi puppets, King Faisal and Nuri as- Said,
overthrown by the bloodthirsty Col. Kassim.  US uses Kassim to
attack Nasser.  Kassim murdered by Col. Aref in CIA-mounted
coup.  Aref's helicopter blown up.  A few more murders later,
CIA helps engineer into power a promising, young, Baath Party
enforcer, Saddam Hussein,

*1960

Anwar Sadat goes on CIA payroll.  After Nasser's death, CIA puts
Sadat into power in Egypt.  Corrupt and hated, Sadat is
assassinated to great popular joy..

*1969

The US elbows Britain out of Libya to gain control of its
high-grade oil.  CIA overthrows British puppet, King Idris, and
- - in one of its most brilliant moves - helps into power a young,
reformist colonel, Muammar Khadaffi.  When Khadaffi subsequently
trumpets the Arabs are being robbed of their oil by the west,
and raises prices, he goes unto America's hit list.

*1976

US, Iran and Israel secretly arm Iraq's Kurds and promote their
rebellion to destabilize Iraq.  Kurdish revolt plays major role
in igniting Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988 in which one million died.
US abandons Kurds, gets chummy with Baghdad.

*1980

Saddam Hussein becomes America's most important Mideast ally in
trying to crush Iran's Islamic revolution.  Urged on, armed and
financed by the US, Saddam invades Iran in 1980.  CIA and
Pentagon supply military advice and intelligence on Iran.  US
and British intelligence help Iraq obtain its chemical and
biological warfare capabilities.

*1983

US attempts to install a client, Christian/fascist regime in
Lebanon, drive out Syrian influence.  US Marines sent to Beirut,
under cover of `peace-keepers.'  They are bombed out of Lebanon
by Shia militants:  309 Americans die, including CIA's top
Mideast staff.

*1985

CIA's revenge backfires.  Lebanese CIA agents detonate truck
bomb in Beirut in a failed attempt to assassinate Shia leader,
Sheik Fadlallah.  Eighty-three civilians killed, 240 wounded.

*1986

US tries to assassinate Khadaffi by bombing his residence in
Tripoli.  One baby daughter killed, one injured.  He escapes.
Downing of Pan Am and French UTA flights may be revenge for this
failed hit.  Three other attempt to assassinate Khadaffi, using
CIA-organized Libyan exiles, fail.

*1996

The Bay of Camels - CIA's biggest flop since Cuba.  Urged on
by President Clinton, CIA mounts an elaborate coup against
Saddam Hussein.  Iraqi exiles, armed and trained by CIA, to
march on Baghdad from US/British ruled Kurdistan.  CIA organizes
a cabal of generals to assassinate Saddam.  Public places in
Baghdad are bombed, many civilians killed, in order to
`destabilize' Iraq (this while the US is busy denouncing
terrorism).  But Saddam's spies have infiltrated the plot.  The
whole operation collapses.  CIA's agent network in Iraq is
rolled up.  Many Kurds back Saddam, turn on pro-US Kurds.  CIA
agents in Kurdistan run for their lives, abandoning allies and
tons of documents.  Saddam is strengthened.  CIA's inept
Director, John Deutch, fired for this Mother of All Fiascos.  .

Republicans now urge more of the above to keep the Mideast
calm. You certainly can't argue with success.
