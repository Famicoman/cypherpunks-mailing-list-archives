    WELCOME  to The Doors Collectors Magazines
             Strange Days News Emailer  Vol. 3
 
              The Celebration Has Just Begun!

 
STRANGE DAYS  MEMORABILIA  NEWS  ITEMS:

   Congratulations to the five Doors Autographed Box Set winners! These Doors box sets were signed by Ray, John, and Robby on the front cover of the inside book and were given away to random people from our Strange Days Email List.  The winners were: Jim Kearns (Camillus, NY),  Ainslee Rogers (Hamilton, Canada),  Suzie Williams (Harrogate, TN), and Barry Abbott (Ermington, Austrailia), and Laura Pritchett (Missoula, MT).  This contest added over 1,000 people to our email list, so watch out for promotions similar to this in the future!

   The Doors Tour Equipment from our last emailer is still available. One envious person on the net is saying that these items aren't authentic... Vince Treanor (The Doors Road Manager) wanted me to pass along the message that he would be happy to talk to any prospective buyers who believe this bullshit. Call me to set up a three way call to Vince. Prospective buyers only please!

   Recently lots of new memorabilia items have turned up due to the release of the box set.  The rest of this issue of the Strange Days News Emailer is dedicated solely to new items that are both "Wanted" and are "For Sale".  If you aren’t into collecting Doors memorabilia, you still might want to read on; I’ve tried to put a little news into each entry.  Enjoy!  For more info about how to order, please go to:

   with poem by Jan Eloise Morris. This 24x36 poster is in its fourth year of world-wide distribution. The photograph was taken in 1968 by Doors photographer, Paul Ferrara. Jim was captured in a rare moment with sunlight falling on his shoulders in front of the Observatory in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. The poster's publication in 1994 marked the only time another artist's poetry has been authorized to appear with Morrison's image. Jan’s association with The Doors Collectors Magazine affords us the exclusive opportunity to offer signed, dated copies only through this web site. Price: $20 includes shipping U.S. (please add $5 for delivery outside of the U.S.)

*** An American Prayer Acetate.  
   We have a private collection that we are offering for sale which includes test pressings of An American Prayer LP.  These copies came from someone who was directly responsible for many production decisions on the An American Prayer LP release. Acetates are temporary albums good for playing only a few times that are necessary to check how the sound will be when the tape gets pressed onto the actual vinyl.  There are probably only these copies for the entire An American Prayer release in existence! Both have their original Capital Records Mastering Jackets and are individually are described below:

   Copy #1: dated 9-20-78 Exc. Condition. One double sided album that contains all songs.  Price $500 (plus $4.50 s&amp;h)

  Copy #2: dated 10-13-78 Exc. Condition. A pair of two single sided albums that are missing two songs on each side.  Price: $650 (plus $4.50 s&amp;h)

*** The Church of The Doors’ Deadly Doorknell  
   If you’re a hard core Doors fan you’ll remember former Church of The Doors High Mojomuck, Anthony Spurlock when he made headlines in 1992 inside Newsweek magazine.  He also made news again when he single handedly thwarted off a public attack from radio station evangelist, Bob Larson. Sadly after this the church closed it’s doors forever. 
   For years I’ve been trying to get permission to reprint these. Finally I’ve done it!  You can now obtain quality reprints direct from the masters of their best (and last) two issues (Spring 1992 &amp; Winter 1992-93) for the same $5 each (plus postage) that they originally cost. For more information on The Church, check out the new article on our website’s On-Line Magazine written back in 1993 for our first printed magazine by their High Mojomuck, Anthony Spurlock located at:
<A  HREF="http://www.doors.com/magazine/">http://www.doors.com/magazine/</A>
