   &gt;   &gt; Hey, Vulis is probably looking for a real job.
   &gt;   &gt;
   &gt;   &gt; Maybe he's finally found one.
   &gt;
   &gt;   I hear he already had one: he's a lecturer at a University in new york
   &gt;   (not sure of names of NY universitys), unless your actions lead
   &gt;   indirectly to his contract being terminated.

#
#  Q: Who is Dimitri Vulis?
#
#  A: Dimitri is an XSoviet immigrant.
#
#  He harasses people all over the net with the most offensive sorts of messages,
#  and uses dirty tricks to retaliate to the people who do get offended. Among
#  his accomplished feats is a series of articles about cat-eating dogs posted to
#  rec.pets.cats (which caused a wave of complaints and made him lost his CUNY
#  account) ; a series of porno binaries with obscene comments about his
#  opponents posted to math-related newsgroups (he lost another academic account,
#  at fordham.edu, after this scandal);

#     Dimitri Vulis, Adjunct Instructor in Computer Science. BA, MA, CUNY
#     Dimitri: I haven't been teaching at Fordham for a few years.
#              It's too far and the pay's too low.
#  ]
#  ...and a series of racist articles denigrating all aspects of romanian life
#  and culture which used to haunt the romanian newsgroup for years.

   &gt;   &gt; He posted from 'cj3@alt.net' _after_ being terminated from PSINet.
   &gt;   
   &gt;   You sure?  I mean it could as easily as not been someone spoofing him,
   &gt;   what with the various anonymous mails, etc., that you reported.

It is a blatant obviousity.

Traffic analysis simply means convincing one or more people
that it's the same person...
