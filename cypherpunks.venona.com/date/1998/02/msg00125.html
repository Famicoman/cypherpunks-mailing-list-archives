Holy shit.

&gt;
&gt;         Court: Domain fees appear illegal
&gt;         By Brock N. Meeks
&gt;
&gt;         WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 - A federal court Monday issued a
&gt;         temporary injunction barring the federal government from
&gt;         spending some $50 million it has collected from the
&gt;         registration of Internet domain names. That money forms a
&gt;         pool of funds intended to be spent for improving the
&gt;         Internet. On Monday, the court sided with the plaintiffs in a
&gt;         lawsuit that claims those fees constitute an illegal tax. 
&gt;
&gt;         The money is part of a so-called "intellectual infrastructure
&gt;         fund," which is funded by 30 percent of all fees paid to
&gt;         register an Internet domain name. Initial domain names cost
&gt;         $100; renewal of domain names is $50 annually. The
&gt;         remainder of registration fees goes to Network Solutions
&gt;         Inc. (NSOL) to cover its cost of maintaining the registration
&gt;         service. 
&gt;
&gt;         Network Solutions operates as a monopoly, stemming from
&gt;         a National Science Foundation government grant. That
&gt;         grant is supposed to end in March; the White House issued
&gt;         a proposal Jan. 30 that would move domain name
&gt;         registration into the private sector. 
&gt;
&gt;         In October, six domain-name holders filed suit in U.S.
&gt;         District Court alleging that the National Science Foundation
&gt;         had no authority to allow Network Solutions to collect any
&gt;         money in excess of its cost of providing the registration
&gt;         service. Further, the suit charged, the 30 percent
&gt;         set-aside amounts to an unconstitutional tax. 
&gt;
&gt;         Judge Thomas Hogan said Monday that the plaintiffs "have
&gt;         made a significant showing that the (intellectual
&gt;         infrastructure fund) is an illegal tax." 
&gt;
&gt;         Hogan said there is "no litmus paper onto which the Court
&gt;         can drop a regulatory assessment such as this one, hoping
&gt;         to see whether the paper comes up blue for tax or pink for
&gt;         fee." Justice Department lawyers had argued in court that
&gt;         the domain-name registration fee was exactly that, a fee,
&gt;         because it was paid voluntarily and therefore couldn't be
&gt;         considered a tax. 
&gt;
&gt;         But Hogan disagreed, writing that "there is no dispute that
&gt;         the assessment (registration fee) is involuntary - it is
&gt;         automatically charged to every domain registration." 
&gt;
&gt;         In 1995 Network Solution's contract was amended to allow
&gt;         it to begin collecting fees for the registration process,
&gt;         which it had done for free since 1993, when its contract
&gt;         was issued. The registration fees set off a firestorm of
&gt;         criticism in the Internet community. The Intellectual
&gt;         Infrastructure Fund was supposed to be used for the
&gt;         betterment of the Internet for the community as a whole;
&gt;         however, no plan has ever developed on how to spend the
&gt;         money, which is held in escrow. 
&gt;
&gt;         Because no plan had been developed to spend the fund
&gt;         money, Congress rushed into the vacuum late last year
&gt;         and simply appropriated some $23 million. Congress
&gt;         earmarked that money to be spent on the Next Generation
&gt;         Internet project, which President Bill Clinton highlighted in
&gt;         his recent State of the Union speech. 
&gt;
&gt;         "Under federal law, no independent executive agency -
&gt;         such as the National Science Foundation - can collect
&gt;         fees that exceed the cost of providing the service they are
&gt;         administering," said William Bode, attorney for the plaintiffs.
&gt;         "NSI, the agent of NSF, spends less than $5 to register
&gt;         domain names, yet it charges a registration fee of $100 and
&gt;         renewal fees of $50 per year," he said. 
&gt;
&gt;         Network Solutions did not return calls for comment. 
&gt;
&gt;         Bode also argued that only Congress has the authority to
&gt;         tax and that no such authorization has taken place. The
&gt;         Justice Department argued that because Congress
&gt;         appropriated the $23 million from the infrastructure fund, it
&gt;         had essentially ratified the tax. 
&gt;
&gt;         Bode argued that ratification of a tax can't take place in
&gt;         authorization bills. Judge Hogan agreed, noting that
&gt;         ratification is a legislative function and that "it is well known
&gt;         that Congress does not normally legislate through
&gt;         appropriations bills." Hogan added: "Congress may have
&gt;         intended to grant NSF the authority to collect the
&gt;         assessment, but it has not effected a legal ratification." 
&gt;
&gt;         The suit also is seeking antitrust damages, alleging that the
&gt;         NSF violated the competition in contracting act when it
&gt;         allowed Network Solutions to begin collecting the $100 fee.
&gt;         Bode says the competition act requires the NSF to re-bid a
&gt;         new contract, not simply amend it. 
&gt;
&gt;         The temporary injunction "paves the way for our motion,
&gt;         which we'll file in two days, to require NSI to return all
&gt;         registration renewal fees which exceed the cost of
&gt;         providing that service," attorney Bode said. "We think that
&gt;         cost [to NSI for the registration process] is significantly less
&gt;         than $10, probably $2 to $3," he said, "which would mean
&gt;         that there would be a refund of approximately $100 million
&gt;         in our judgment."
