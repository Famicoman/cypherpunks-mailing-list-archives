Kindergartner arrested in school scuffle
By Sonja Lewis and Lesley Conn
New Journal Staff Writters

    Her daddy told her it was like finger-painting, but 5 yaer-old
Chaquita Doman was actually being fingerprinted following her arrest
Wednesday and it wasn't fun.
    The Edgewater Elementary kindergarten student was booked on a felony
battery warrant at the Department of Youth Services after scuffling with
her school counselor. Linda green, 51, told Escambia deputies Chaquita bit
and scratched her Feb. 3 when she tried to calm the girl. The warrant for
battery of an elected official or educator was issued the day of the
incident.
    Escambia deputies have never arrested anyone younger, a spokeswoman
said.
    Chaquita's father, Lee Ernest Middleton, said the arrest is the most
ludicrous thing he's ever experienced.
    District spokeswoman Barbara Frye said school officials were making
sure a child with "an-out-of-contorl rage" got some counseling.
    Deputies notified Chaquita's parents Tuesday of the arrest warrant.
Her parents brought her in Wednesday.
    "Can you imagine what it's like to have your daughter fingerprinted
and escorted by a deputy to a juvenile facility?" asked her father.
    Middleton, 35, said he plans to contact a lawer as early as this
morning because of the emotional trauma suffered by his daughter and her
identical twin sister, Shakita.
    He took his daughters out of school Thursday.
    Missing four of her front teeth, Chaquita nodded Thursday that she bit
and scratched someone. "She's good", she said tossing her thumb towards
her twin. "I'm bad".
    Chaquita threw furniture and inflicted at least 27 deep scratches and
bit Green's arm to cause "significant bleeding," Frye said.
    Chaquita was suspended for three days and her parents were asked to
sign a counseling referral slip, Frye said. Because Green wanted the child
to be councled, she called deputies.
    Middleton says he was not asked to sign anything until her suspention
was up. He said he agreed to counseling.
    Because of juvenile protection laws, the State Attorney's Office could
not say what action was taken. But her parents were told there would be no
charges filed, they said.
