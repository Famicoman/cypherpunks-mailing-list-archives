&gt;    
&gt;                 GOODBYE, "FREE SOFTWARE"; HELLO, "OPEN SOURCE"
&gt;                                        
&gt;    After the Netscape announcement broke in February early 1998 I did a
&gt;    lot of thinking about the next phase -- the serious push to get "free
&gt;    software" accepted in mainstream corporate America. And I realized we
&gt;    have a serious problem with "free software" itself.
&gt;    
&gt;    Specifically, we have a problem with the term "free software", itself,
&gt;    not the concept. I've become convinced that the term has to go.
&gt;    
&gt;    The problem with it is twofold. First, it's confusing; the term "free"
&gt;    is very ambiguous (something the Free Software Foundation's propaganda
&gt;    has to wrestle with constantly). Does "free" mean "no money charged?"
&gt;    or does it mean "free to be modified by anyone", or something else?
&gt;    
&gt;    Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous. While this
&gt;    does not intrinsically bother me in the least, we now have a pragmatic
&gt;    interest in converting these people rather than thumbing our noses at
&gt;    them. There's now a chance we can make serious gains in the mainstream
&gt;    business world without compromising our ideals and commitment to
&gt;    technical excellence -- so it's time to reposition. We need a new and
&gt;    better label.
&gt;    
&gt;    I brainstormed this with some Silicon Valley fans of Linux the day
&gt;    after my meeting with Netscape (Feb 5th). We kicked around and
&gt;    discarded several alternatives, and we came up with a replacement
&gt;    label we all liked: "open source".
&gt;    
&gt;    John "maddog" Hall and Larry Augustin, both of the Linux International
&gt;    Board of Directors, were in on the brainstorming session (though
&gt;    interestingly enough the term "open source" was suggested by
&gt;    non-hacker Chris Peterson, observing for the Foresight Institute).
&gt;    Linus Torvalds himself approved it the following day. And it isn't a
&gt;    Linux-only thing; Keith Bostic likes it and says he thinks the BSD
&gt;    community can be brought on board.
&gt;    
&gt;    We suggest that everywhere we as a culture have previously talked
&gt;    about "free software", the label should be changed to "open source".
&gt;    Open-source software. The open-source model. The open source culture.
&gt;    The Debian Open Source Guidelines. (In pitching this to corporate
&gt;    America I'm also going to be invoking the idea of "peer review" a
&gt;    lot.)
&gt;    
&gt;    Bruce Perens has volunteered to register "open source" as a trademark
&gt;    and hold it through Software in the Public Interest. And RMS himself
&gt;    has said he'll use the term (though not exclusively) as long as the
&gt;    Open Source Definition Bruce is working up isn't weaker than the
&gt;    Debian Free Software Guidelines.
&gt;    
&gt;    And, we should explain publicly the reason for the change. Linus has
&gt;    been saying in "World Domination 101" that the open-source culture
&gt;    needs to make a serious effort to take the desktop and engage the
&gt;    corporate mainstream. Of course he's right -- and this re-labeling, as
&gt;    Linus agrees, is part of the process. It says we're willing to work
&gt;    with and co-opt the market for our own purposes, rather than remaining
&gt;    stuck in a marginal, adversarial position.
&gt;    
&gt;    It's crunch time, people. The Netscape announcement changes
&gt;    everything. We've broken out of the little corner we've been in for
&gt;    twenty years. We're in a whole new game now, a bigger and more
&gt;    exciting one -- and one I think we can win.
&gt;
