&gt;&gt;&gt; You know Tim, I respect most of what you write, and I respect you in
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you have your own free will and opinions and the right to express
&gt;&gt;&gt; them, but what you have forgotten in your anarchistic ravings is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; PEOPLE DIED IN SOMALIA, including a personal friend of mine.  They were
&gt;&gt;&gt; all somebody's son, brother, and friend. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So were the 100,000 Iraqi military killed by Bush, and the 1,000,000
&gt;&gt;Iraqis of all ages killed by US sanctions.  So were the civilians
&gt;&gt;bulldozed into mass graves in Panama, so the country would look neat and
&gt;&gt;tidy for the arrival of the ReportWhores.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What the world needs now is not another mass killing of Iraqis by the
&gt;&gt;United States government.  What the world really needs now is a fifty
&gt;&gt;dollar weapon that sinks aircraft carriers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; These soldiers went where they were ordered to go, as befits a soldier,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and tried to do the job they were given and accomplish the mission, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; for that EVERY ONE OF THEM DESERVES Y O U R RESPECT.  I am quite sure
&gt;&gt;&gt; the vast majority of them thought it was patently stupid to go to
&gt;&gt;&gt; Somalia in the first place, but a soldier follows orders, legal ones,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and tries to get the job done regardless of personal feelings.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Most of them would probably follow "legal orders" to fire upon American
&gt;&gt;civilians too.  

&gt;You ever served in the military?  Unless you've been under fire, you
&gt;should shut the fuck up about shit you know nothing about nor could
&gt;comprehend.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The next time you "cheer to see the U.S. gets its tail kicked", why
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't you think about the American troops who lost their lives or were
&gt;&gt;&gt; maimed, or who were doing something they may have been personally and
&gt;&gt;&gt; morally against, but they chose to be professional soldiers, and instead
&gt;&gt;&gt; of displaying cowardice, they tried to do what was asked of them. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The universe does not view the lives of Americans as more valuable than
&gt;&gt;the lives of people murdered by Americans. 

&gt;Listen up jerk, in case you didn't get any news during 1990, Iraq
&gt;attacked Kuwait, and murdered thousands of Kuwaitis.  "Don't start no
&gt;shit and there won't be no shit"... ever heard that, asshole?  America
&gt;would have never been involved if Iraq hadn't invaded Kuwait.  I was
&gt;there, in a Bradley, and we could have rolled all over Baghdad,
&gt;especially after what the Iraqi bastards did to the Kuwaitis, but it
&gt;wasn't done. Unfortunately Saddam Hussein stayed in power.  There will
&gt;not be a shred of a chance for peace in that region until he is DEAD.  I
&gt;don't think air strikes are the answer to this, and I think Clinton is a
&gt;moron for his present policy, War is the worst thing that man can do to
&gt;other men, and there is no such thing as "the good fight"... war is hell.
&gt;Period.  Until you have been in a war, you have no idea of what you are
&gt;talking about.  But if you think that Iraq was "more right" or better
&gt;yet, "less wrong", you need a radical lobotomy, or perhaps you've already
&gt;had one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Think of the innocent civilians who inevitably die in the conflicts
&gt;&gt;&gt; started by the megalomaniacs like Saddam Hussein.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You mean all those melted child car seats and scorched teddy bears on
&gt;&gt;George Bush's "Highway of Death" leading out of Kuwait? 

&gt;Evidently, you again know nothing of what the Iraqis did to the Kuwaitis
&gt;on their way in to Kuwait.  Get educated, shithead. 

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, for all the braying Americans do about freedom, Americans
&gt;&gt;can never be truly happy unless someone is telling them what to do, or
&gt;&gt;they are telling someone else what to do, or they are bombing someone for
&gt;&gt;not doing what they have told them to do. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The only thing Americans understand is dead Americans.  The only thing. 

&gt;You sound like nothing more than disillusioned, spoiled, pompous asshole
&gt;when you presume to know what Americans "understand".  Your anarchistic
&gt;ravings only mark you for the idiot you are.

&gt;To everyone else besides Cordian who reads this, my apologies, but for
&gt;all it's failings, I still have pride in America... ...not for all the
&gt;foreign policy bullshit or the way the government fucks us over, or
&gt;starts wars, or sticks their collective nose in other countries
&gt;business...but for the fact that as a whole people, Americans still keep
&gt;trying, everyday, to be a better people. I'm proud of that.

Wow! I haven't seen this kind of reactionary temper-tantrum since the last
4th of July BBQ down at the VFW.

So how long were you in?? Usally this type of "God save the King"
mentality wears off after a boot has been in the field for a few months.
For the more febal minded it lasts longer but they usally never make it
above Cpl. or 1st Lt.
