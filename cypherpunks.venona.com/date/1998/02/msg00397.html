&gt; &gt; &gt; It's a signal that is mixed and laid down by the machine. It covers the
&gt; &gt; entire track. The cassette head only has two or four head depending on if
&gt; &gt; it has auto-revers and moves the head.
&gt; 
&gt; So you are saying that the is a continuous track of varying amplitiude
&gt; that
&gt; defines the audio signal?  And that your bias is a part of this?

Actualy a standard cassette tape has 4 tracks grouped in pairs. Each pair is
given one of the channel. The audio that comes in is mixed with a bias
signal (using a summing amp) and then laid down on the tape.

&gt; &gt;From what I know, the bias is a parameter to the recording process and
&gt; not
&gt; the recording as it can be recovered from the magnets.  It is something
&gt; intended to forward-correct error, which is not intended to be
&gt; interpreted
&gt; in the future.

Huh? I have been involved in audio recording for over 20 years, acted as
rodies for a host of bands (some of which actualy made records - but alas no
money) and I must admit that the above sentences don't make any sense to me
at all. Can you possible reword them?

What magnets? 'paramter of the recording process'? 'forward-correct error'?
'interpreted in the future'?

If your heads are magnetised you really should de-gauss them. They'll erase
your tapes eventualy...

&gt; Looking for satellites?

No, to do that I use a C-band hooked to a alt-az mount and a digital modem.
I'll probably just make a normal Newtonian and hood a CCD camera to it and
feed my Video Toaster to digitize and enhance the images. I am particular
inchanged by the Moon. I can look at it for extended periods. I was
enchanted by it when Men stepped onto it for the first time. I very much
hope that we (as a race) go back to stay...

&gt; Did you snag a job?  I had a headhunter call tonight.  It's been a year
&gt; or
&gt; so since they've bothered me.

I talked to BMC Software today. Looks like I'll probably go to work for them
supporting their suite of database products. I should know tomorrow if they
want to do the final interview which means I'll go to work for them on
Monday.

&gt; You've gotta get this Pringles thing in order.  Faith breaks the back of
&gt; these
&gt; types of philosophies.  If you give in to faith, you should normally
&gt; incorporate
&gt; it.  That doesn't mean that you have to explain it through the
&gt; philosophy, but
&gt; if that faith is the only thing that you know is indespensable, you need
&gt; to
&gt; reconsider how indespensable a philosophy that does not make room for it
&gt; is.

Uh, ok.

Ta ta.
