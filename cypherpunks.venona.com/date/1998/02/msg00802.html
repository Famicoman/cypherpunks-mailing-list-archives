THE LAST GIG
---------------

We recently returned from an elite financial retreat, Morgan Stanley's Ski
Weekend in Deer Valley, Utah (I know, life is tough), where we played two
sets for a crowd of CEOs and CFOs, and we had them dancing on the tables!

Highlights from that show:

Back in the U.S.S.R. (Beatles)
Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers)
-- Roger leads these openers, both howlers, got them on their feet with a
not-so-subtle political message.

Brown-Eyed Girl (Van Morrison)
-- Giles sings that souful lead, but this time with the two conference
organizers singing backup!

City of New Orleans (Arlo Guthrie)
-- with guest vocalist Tom Cottingham, an original member of Random Axes

Deal (Grateful Dead)
-- perfect for those investment bankers in the audience.

One Toke Over the Line (Brewer &amp; Shipley)
-- ... and for once, Tony's home town was not introduced as the capital of
Calif. largest cash crop.

Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones)
-- another good one for investment bankers, this time with Morgan Stanley's
chief organizer Rex playing drums.

Layla (Eric Clapton)
-- Just about our finest version, merging the laid-back style that won Eric
so many awards with the high-octane guitar solo that made this song so
interesting, plus the Duane Allman slide second part sans piano.

Paint It, Black (Rolling Stones)
-- Whoa! What a tambourine ride, Corrine! Giles screams this one while Tony
gives us his Morroccan interpretation.

Like a Rolling Stone (Bob Dylan)
-- You can't beat this message. How many of these financial types actually
feel like they have no home, no direction known? Complete unknown?

Ticket to Ride (Beatles)
-- Bert gets this guitar part exactly perfect, while Roger and Tony play
John and Paul.

Jack Straw (Grateful Dead)
-- We can share the women, we can share the wine. Now that's something
those financial types can understand... This was incandescent. Larry was
once again brilliant.

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (The Band)
-- Our "Gone With the Wind" interpretation, led by Roger.

Six Days on the Road (Flying Burrito Brothers and others)
-- Thanks Giles, for your life story. Way to play, Tony and others...

White Room (Cream)
-- Tony sings, and Bert just wails on lead guitar!

Last Time (Rolling Stones) -&gt; Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad (Grateful
Dead and others)
-- Goin' where the climate suits my clothes... Dr. Bill, he of the big
bottom sound, rocked the house.

White Shoe Shuffle (Flying Other Brothers Band)
-- Our own truly original number, written by Dr. Bill Bennett, had them
rolling the aisles (laughing) as Tony sang lead.

Uncle John's Band (Grateful Dead)
-- We had the audience singing along on this one, in 4-part harmony. Once
again, Larry knows where the time goes.

Abbey Road Side 2 (Beatles)
-- Bert's "Here Comes the Sun" into Roger's "Mean Mr. Mustard" and on
through the rest of the songs into "The End" which absolutely captivated
this crowd.


Encores (yes they hollered for more):

Iko Iko (Neville Brothers, Grateful Dead, lots of others)
-- We brought back Rex for drums, and introduced Roger Lynch on guitar, who
was already too good for us!

Johnny B. Goode (Chuck Berry and everyone else)
-- We just had to do it. Thanks everyone, and good night!

They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.
