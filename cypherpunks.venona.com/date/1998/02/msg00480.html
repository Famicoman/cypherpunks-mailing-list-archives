I do not know where this was published but it seems interesting...

&gt; Got this interesting article from an old friend of mine.........the
&gt; best approach seems to be to build GUI-based applications on the
&gt; front-end and use mainframes as big servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; By Martin J. Garvey
&gt; 
&gt;         The mainframe, once the IT backbone for many enterprises, is
&gt; regaining that stature. Next month, several large companies will lead
&gt; the charge back to big iron in an attempt to rescue unwieldy or
&gt; stalled client-server projects. Mainframes, these companies say,
&gt; provide better price/performance and return on investment than their
&gt; sleeker Unix and Windows NT systems, while delivering proven security,
&gt; scalability, and reliable centralized management.
&gt; 
&gt;         GTE Data Services, Motorola Semiconductor, University Health
&gt; System, and others are at the cusp of a trend toward leveraging the
&gt; mainframe to back out of costly or unmanageable Unix and Windows NT
&gt; client-server implementations. Brian Jeffery, an analyst with
&gt; International Technology Group, an IT consulting firm in Los Altos,
&gt; Calif., says about 70 sites worldwide are porting Unix or NT
&gt; applications back to IBM OS/390-based mainframes. By fall, he
&gt; estimates, as many as 300 sites will convert Oracle, SAP, and
&gt; PeopleSoft projects to OS/390. "By 1998, there will be thousands of
&gt; these accounts," predicts Jeffery.
&gt; 
&gt;     "It's a brand new life for the mainframe," says Cal Braunstein, a
&gt; consultant with Robert Frances Group, an IT market research firm in
&gt; Westport, Conn. "It's far less expensive to tie Unix and client-server
&gt; information into mainframes than it is to spread it out across much
&gt; smaller systems."
&gt; 
&gt;     University Health System, a 450-bed hospital in San Antonio, hopes
&gt; to begin in August to move data-intensive applications, such as
&gt; patient accounting and discharge, to the IBM Parallel Sysplex
&gt; mainframe.  The project is expected to be completed by year's end. "We
&gt; can't go in a direction of more and more resources for a nonending
&gt; distributed environment," says Tim Geryk, director of technical
&gt; services for University Health. "We need to turn it back the other way
&gt; for a better scale of economy."
&gt; 
&gt;         Currently, University Health's enterprise has 2,500 desktops
&gt; attached to LANs, 100 RS/6000 Unix servers, about 600 other Unix
&gt; machines, 2,000 dumb terminals, an IBM ES/ 9000 bipolar mainframe, and
&gt; an IBM 9672 CMOS mainframe. "It's time-intensive to keep so many
&gt; workstations and servers up and running when so many different things
&gt; can go wrong," says Geryk. "We can't put our hands around it anymore."
&gt; 
&gt;     The company is installing an IBM Parallel Sysplex architecture
&gt; that supports Unix applications to provide a single-platform image
&gt; across its enterprise. Bill Tudor, director of systems product
&gt; management for mainframe maker Hitachi Data Systems in Santa Clara,
&gt; Calif., says it's not uncommon to see multiple racks with 200 Unix
&gt; servers in the data center. "It's just cheaper to run that same
&gt; information on the mainframe," he says.
&gt; 
&gt;         According to Jeffery of ITG, it's cheaper and easier to
&gt; increase network bandwidth for integration between Unix servers and
&gt; the mainframe than it is to add more Unix servers. Also, customers are
&gt; demanding that systems management, as well as enterprise data itself,
&gt; be centralized.
&gt; 
&gt;         And according to the Clipper Group, a consultancy in
&gt; Wellesley, Mass., Unix's security hasn't caught up to the mainframe's.
&gt; Some intrepid IT users aren't just migrating some applications to
&gt; mainframes. They're also consolidating client-server architectures
&gt; onto big iron. One financial services company reportedly is
&gt; consolidating as many as 600 Unix servers onto one mainframe, sources
&gt; say.
&gt; 
&gt;         The hidden costs of Unix servers may be the final incentive to
&gt; push many customers back to the mainframe. For example, CMOS
&gt; mainframes may cost three times more than Unix servers, but management
&gt; costs for distributed Unix servers are 20 times greater than those for
&gt; supporting a mainframe, according to Giga Information Group in
&gt; Cambridge, Mass.
&gt; 
&gt;         IT managers can port Unix applications to the OS/390 mainframe
&gt; operating system for acceptable performance in a production
&gt; environment. Moreover, enterprise applications, including those from
&gt; Oracle, PeopleSoft, and SAP, are available on OS/390. And the CMOS
&gt; processor architecture, the heart of IBM's Parallel Sysplex mainframe
&gt; cluster that scales to 32 processors, is for the first time as
&gt; powerful as older bipolar mainframes.
&gt; 
&gt;         Motorola's $7.9 billion semiconductor business unit in Phoenix
&gt; will begin moving all of its SAP R/3 data to the mainframe in the next
&gt; four months.
&gt; 
&gt;         Its architecture will then include PC clients, Unix servers as
&gt; application servers, and an IBM OS/390-based Parallel Sysplex
&gt; mainframe as host for about 500 Gbytes of data. The company says it is
&gt; one of five pilot sites for SAP's R/3 on the mainframe. Before taking
&gt; on the pilot, the semiconductor manufacturer evaluated multiple Unix
&gt; servers and databases. The Unix systems lost to the mainframe because
&gt; they lacked the power and manageability Motorola was looking for. "It
&gt; was the best way to keep the database in one place," says Patrick
&gt; Horrigan, corporate VP and IS director for Motorola's SPS division.
&gt; "And it's 40% cheaper than the Unix solutions."
&gt; 
&gt;     'Tons Of Unix'
&gt;         At GTE Data Services in Temple Terrace, Fla., shifting its
&gt; distributed applications to the mainframe conforms to the division's
&gt; motto of "right data, right device." The group is consolidating six
&gt; systems into three or four. "With our so-called distributed systems,we
&gt; have tons of Unix out there, but it's really not even distributed,"
&gt; says operations director Pat Remick. "We're just piling a lot of Unix
&gt; boxes on raised floors next to the mainframes, so we decided to look
&gt; at the better reliability and scalability of the mainframe."
&gt; 
&gt;         Analysts point out that server consolidation isn't relegated
&gt; solely to mainframes. HP and Sun Microsystems recently both announced
&gt; enterprise-class servers that many say will suffice as Unix
&gt; consolidation servers. "There is increasing value in consolidating
&gt; Unix servers and PC servers separate from mainframes," says John
&gt; Young, VP of enterprise systems planning for the Clipper Group.
&gt; "People are realizing the savings behind the re-emergence of the data
&gt; center. It's the place for consolidating processing, management,
&gt; accountability, and data storage."
&gt; 
&gt;         The pioneers in the migration back to mainframes say they
&gt; aren't ready to dismiss Unix. "Our client and application server tiers
&gt; of R/3 will remain distributed with Unix," says Motorola SPS's
&gt; Horrigan.  However, distributed computing could benefit from greater
&gt; reliability, availability, and scalability. "Downtime from distributed
&gt; systems costs too much in management, and I know a lot of processing
&gt; is on Unix," says GTE's Remick. "But some transition must happen.
&gt; Something has to be done."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     SIDEBAR:Reasons For Returning
&gt; *   Mainframe security is at least two years ahead of Unix or Windows
&gt; NT
&gt; *   OS/390 can run Unix, NT, and enterprise applications such as SAP
&gt; R/3
&gt; *   Mainframes have the capacity to store a database of 500 Gbytes or
&gt; more without splitting it up
&gt; *   Parallel Sysplex configurations have no single point of failure
&gt; and are easy to update and maintain while the system is running
