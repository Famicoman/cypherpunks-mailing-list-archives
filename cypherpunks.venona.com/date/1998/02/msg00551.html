STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Israel and the Occupied Territories
============================================================
Israel and the Occupied Territories  - Public Announcement
 February 14, 1998

 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Office of the Spokesman

The American Embassy in Tel Aviv and the U.S. Consulate General in 
Jerusalem are issuing the following Warden Message:

"This message supplements the Public Announcement issued by the 
U.S. Department of State on February 10, 1998 for the Middle East 
and South Asia.
 
The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and Consulate General in Jerusalem 
continue to closely monitor the situation with Iraq. The U.S. 
Government believes there is a low probability of attack on Israel, 
the West Bank or Gaza, and that the possibility of Iraq using 
chemical and biological weapons (CBW) is remote, but cannot be 
excluded. American citizens are advised to avoid travel to the West 
Bank and Gaza and to exercise caution in Jerusalem, particularly in 
the area of the old city of Jerusalem.  The U.S. Consulate General 
in Jerusalem has suspended personal travel of its employees to the 
West Bank and has placed restrictions on official travel to the West 
Bank.  

These are precautionary measures only.  However, given the current 
tensions in the region, the U.S. Government believes it is important 
for all citizens to maintain readiness in the unlikely event of an 
emergency.

At this time, the Government of Israel is distributing protection 
kits to Israeli citizens and legal residents only. However, we 
understand that the government of Israel is putting in place 
arrangements to determine the most effective ways to distribute gas 
masks to foreign nationals and is in the process of acquiring 
adequate numbers of gas masks to provide for non-Israeli citizens in 
Israel, Jerusalem, and the areas of the West Bank under its control. 
 The Palestinian authority has informed the U.S. Government that it 
does not have protection kits to supply its population or foreign 
residents living within its areas of control.

For those American citizens who need to obtain a new passport or to 
update their registrations, passport hours at the Embassy (71 
Hayarkon Street, Tel Aviv) are Monday through Friday mornings from 
8:30 to 11:00 am and Wednesday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 pm; 
Consulate General in Jerusalem (27 Nablus Road, East Jerusalem) 
passport hours are Monday through Friday mornings from 8:30 to 
12:00, except for the last Friday of the month.

The Embassy and Consulate General urge all U.S. citizens to monitor 
local and international media for further developments.  Should the 
U.S. government need to issue advice to U.S. citizens, the Embassy 
and Consulate will notify the local media and activate our citizens 
warden network immediately.

U.S. citizens contemplating traveling to Israel, the West Bank and 
Gaza should take the above information into consideration and 
should, in addition, consult the latest Consular Information Sheet 
on Israel and the Occupied Territories dated December 23, 1997."

This Public Announcement expires on May 14, 1998.


Israel and the Occupied Territories - Consular Information Sheet
 December 23, 1997

(INCLUDING AREAS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PALESTINIAN 
INTERIM SELF-GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY)

Country Description:  The state of Israel is a parliamentary 
democracy with a modern economy.  Tourist facilities are widely 
available.  Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan 
Heights, and East Jerusalem as a result of the 1967 War.  Pursuant 
to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, an elected 
Palestinian authority now exercises jurisdiction in most of Gaza and 
most of the major cities of the West Bank.  Palestinian Authority 
police have responsibility for keeping order in those areas and the 
Palestinian Authority exercises a range of civil functions in other 
areas of the West Bank. Areas of Israeli and Palestinian Authority 
responsibilities and jurisdiction in the West Bank and Gaza are 
complex.  Definitive information on entry, customs requirements, 
arrests and other matters in the West Bank and Gaza may not be 
available and is subject to change without prior notice.

Embassy/Consulate Location and Sources of Assistance: The U.S. 
Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, is located at 71 Hayarkon Street. The 
U.S. mailing address is PSC 98, Box 0013, APO AE 09830.  The 
telephone number is (972) (3) 519-7575.  After hours number: 
519-7551.  The fax number is 972-3-516-0315.  The e-mail address is 
acs.amcit-telaviv@dos.us-state.gov.

The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy should be contacted for 
information and help in the following areas:  Israel, the Gaza 
Strip, and ports of entry at Ben Gurion Airport, Haifa Port, and the 
northern (Jordan River) and southern (Arava) border crossings 
connecting Israel and Jordan.

The Consular Section of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem is 
located at 27 Nablus Road. The U.S. mailing address is Unit 7228 Box 
0039, APO AE 09830. The telephone number is (972) (2) 625-3288 (via 
Israel)  the after hours number is 625-3201.  The fax number is 
972-2-272-2233.

The U.S. Consulate should be contacted for information and help in 
the following areas: west and east Jerusalem, the West Bank, and 
border crossings at the Allenby Bridge, connecting Jordan with the 
West Bank.

There is a U.S. Consular Agent in Haifa, at telephone (972) (04) 
853-1470, who reports to the Embassy in Tel Aviv.  The Consular 
Agent can provide routine and emergency services in the north.

Entry Requirements:

Israel:  Passports, an onward or return ticket, and proof of 
sufficient funds are required for entry.  A three-month visa may be 
issued for no charge upon arrival, and may be renewed.  Anyone who 
has been refused entry or experienced difficulties with his/her visa 
status during a previous visit, or who has overstayed a visa, can 
obtain information from the Israeli Embassy or nearest Israeli 
consulate regarding the advisability of attempting to return to 
Israel. Permission must be obtained from Israel for anyone 
attempting to claim the status of a returning resident.

Palestinian Authority:  Except during periods of closures, U.S. 
citizens, except those of Palestinian ancestry (see below) may enter 
and exit Gaza and the West Bank on a U.S. passport with an Israeli 
visa.  It is not necessary to obtain a visitor's permit from the 
Palestinian Authority.  Private vehicles frequently encounter long 
delays entering or leaving Gaza; and may also expect to be stopped 
at checkpoints entering or leaving the West Bank.

U.S. citizens who have ever held or now hold resident status in the 
West Bank or Gaza should be aware that they may be subject to the 
same travel regulations governing entry to and exit from Israel that 
affect all other resident Palestinians. In general, such individuals 
are required to hold a Palestinian passport to enter or depart Gaza 
or the West Bank via Israel.  U.S. citizen Palestinian residents 
arriving at Ben Gurion Airport without a Palestinian passport will 
be granted an entry visa to enable their transit to the West Bank or 
Gaza to obtain such documentation from the Palestinian Authority.  A 
Palestinian passport and permit to depart are required to leave via 
Ben Gurion Airport.  No permit is required for departure via the 
Rafah or Allenby border posts.

Palestinians who last departed Israel before the May 1994 Cairo 
Accords (regarding Gaza and Jericho) or the September 1995 Interim 
Agreement (regarding other areas of the West Bank) should re-enter 
Israel through the same port of entry from which they last left (and 
where their travel documents were then deposited).

Specific questions may be addressed to the nearest Israeli embassy 
or consulate.

Israel-Jordan Crossings:  International crossing points are now in 
operation between Israel and Jordan at Arava (Wadi al-'Arabah) 
crossing in the south and the Jordan River crossing (Sheikh Hussein 
Bridge) in the north.  Prior visas are not necessary for American 
citizens using these two crossing points, but travelers will have to 
pay a fee.  Visas should be obtained in advance for those wanting to 
cross the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan and the occupied West 
Bank.  (Note: Palestinian Americans with residency in the West Bank 
must cross into Jordan using the Allenby Bridge.)  Procedures for 
all crossings into Jordan are subject to frequent changes.  

For further entry information, travelers may contact the Israeli 
Embassy at 3514 International Dr., NW, Washington, DC. 20008, 
telephone (202) 364-5500, or the Israeli Consulate General in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, or Houston.

Customs Requirements:  Video cameras, among other items, must be 
declared upon entry to Israel and travelers carrying these items 
must go through the red zone at customs.  Definitive information on 
customs requirements for the Palestinian Authority is not available.

Security Measures:  Israel has strict security measures that may 
affect visitors.  Prolonged questioning and detailed searches may 
take place at the time of entry and/or departure at all points of 
entry to Israel, including entry from any of the areas under 
Palestinian jurisdiction.  American citizens with Arab surnames may 
expect close scrutiny at Ben Gurion Airport and the Allenby Bridge 
from Jordan.  For security reasons, delays or obstacles in bringing 
in or departing with cameras or electronics equipment are not 
unusual.  During searches and questioning, access may be denied to 
U.S. consular officers, lawyers, or family members.  Definitive 
information on security measures in the Palestinian Authority is not 
available.

Terrorism/Security:  Although they have not been specifically 
targeted for attack, U.S. citizens have been killed in past 
terrorist actions in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.   The most 
recent attacks have been in highly frequented shopping and 
pedestrian areas, and public buses. U.S. citizens should use caution 
in crowded pedestrian and shopping areas.   In addition, the U.S. 
Embassy and the Consulate General have warned their employees and 
American citizens to avoid travel on public buses, as well as 
congregating at bus stops and other crowded areas.  This restriction 
does not apply to tour buses.

U.S. citizens should, at all times, avoid large crowds and 
political demonstrations, and not remain in an area where a 
demonstration or altercation appears to be developing.  Such 
gatherings can occur spontaneously, and have the potential to become 
violent without warning.

Areas of Instability -

West Bank and Gaza:  During periods of unrest, the West Bank and 
Gaza are sometimes closed off by the Israeli government.  Travel 
restrictions may be imposed with little or no warning. Strict 
measures have frequently been imposed following terrorist actions.  
In such circumstances,  movement of Palestinians (including 
Palestinian Americans) and foreign passport holders has been 
severely impaired.

Demonstrations by Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank have 
led to confrontations and clashes with the police, with some turning 
deadly.  Stone throwing and other forms of protest can occur without 
warning and can escalate quickly.

In view of the continued potential for violence and unrest in the 
West Bank and Gaza, the State Department advises all American 
citizens to avoid travel to these areas, except for daylight visits 
to Bethlehem, Jericho, Highway 1 from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, 
Route 90 through the Jordan Valley, and tourist sites along these 
routes. Accessible sites for daylight visits include the Inn of the 
Samaritan, Nebi Musa, St. George's Monastery, Mount of Temptation 
Monastery, Qumran, and Qualiah Water Park.  The Consular Section of 
the U.S. Consulate General, located at 27 Nablus Road in East 
Jerusalem, is safe and accessible to all visitors.

The U.S. government maintains tight security procedures regarding 
travel of U.S. government employees, officials, and dependents to 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  Frequently, U.S. government 
employees are instructed not to travel at all to these areas.  
Travel guidelines for U.S. government employees may change at any 
time.

The Palestinian police force has been established in Gaza and the 
major cities of the West Bank which are under Palestinian 
jurisdiction.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian police patrols and 
checkpoints may be encountered.  Many Israeli and Palestinian 
civilians in Gaza and the West Bank possess their own guns.

General Precautions:  Travel on strike days or after dark is not 
recommended.  Tourists using public transportation or traveling by 
car in areas less frequented by tourists are at risk.  Vehicles have 
been damaged, with rental cars in particular being targeted.

Jerusalem:  In Jerusalem, travelers can reduce their risk of being 
involved in violent incidents by traveling in groups, avoiding the 
old city at night, except for the Jewish quarter, and exercising 
caution at religious sites on holy days, Fridays, and Saturdays.  
Most roads into ultra-orthodox Jewish neighborhoods are blocked off 
on Saturdays.  Assaults on secular visitors, either for being in 
cars or for being "immodestly dressed," have been known to occur in 
these neighborhoods.

In the North:  In the Golan Heights, there are live land mines in 
many areas, and some minefields have not been clearly marked or 
fenced.  Visitors who walk only on established roads or trails will 
reduce the risk of injury from mines.  Rocket attacks from Lebanese 
territory can occur without warning close to the northern border of 
Israel.

Driving and Road Conditions:  There is a high rate of fatalities 
relating to auto accidents, and drivers should use caution.  While 
the roads in Israel are well built, the roads in Gaza and most of 
the West Bank are of poor quality.

Arrests and Detention:  U.S. citizens arrested by the Israeli 
National Police (INP) and charged with crimes are entitled to legal 
representation and consular notification and visitation.  Typically 
the INP notifies the Embassy or Consulate General within two days of 
arrest, and consular access is normally granted within four days.  
This procedure may be expedited if the arrested American shows a 
U.S. passport to the police as proof of U.S. citizenship, or asks 
for access to the Embassy or Consulate General.

U.S. citizens arrested in the West Bank for criminal offenses may 
be prevented from communicating with lawyers, family members, or 
consular officers. The U.S. Consulate General is often not notified 
of the arrest, or notified in a timely manner.  Consular access to 
the arrestees can be initially denied and is frequently delayed.

In contrast to persons arrested for criminal offenses, U.S. 
citizens arrested or detained in Israel and the West Bank on 
suspicion of security offenses often are not permitted to 
communicate with consular officials, lawyers, or family members in a 
timely manner during the interrogation period of their case.  They 
may be detained for up to six months at a time without charges.  
Youths over the age of fourteen have been detained and tried as 
adults.  Neither the Embassy nor the Consulate are normally notified 
of the arrests of Americans in the West Bank by Israeli authorities, 
and access to detainees is frequently delayed.  Notification may be 
more rapid if the detained American shows a U.S. passport as proof 
of citizenship and asks the local authorities to contact the Embassy 
or Consulate General.

Medical Facilities:  Modern medical care and medicines are 
available in Israel.  However, some hospitals in Israel and most 
hospitals in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank fall below U.S. 
standards.  Travelers can find information in English about 
emergency medical facilities and after-hours pharmacies in the 
"Jerusalem Post" newspaper.  Doctors and hospitals often expect 
immediate cash payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance 
is not always valid outside the united states.  Supplemental medical 
insurance with specific overseas coverage has proven useful.  The 
Internet site at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(<A  HREF="http://www.cdc.gov">http://www.cdc.gov</A>) has additional health information. Travelers 
from regions where contagious diseases are prevalent may need to 
show shot records before entry into Israel.

Information on Crime:  The crime rate is moderate in Israel, the 
Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport 
abroad should be reported immediately to local police and the 
nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  Useful information on 
safeguarding valuables, protecting personal security, and other 
matters is provided in the Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe 
Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to the Middle East and North 
Africa," available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. 20402.

Drug Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
territory in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, 
use or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe in Israel, and 
convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.  The 
Palestinian Authority also has strict penalties for drug use by 
persons under its jurisdiction.

Court Jurisdiction:  Under Israel's judicial system, the rabbinical 
courts exercise jurisdiction over all Jewish citizens and residents 
of Israel in cases of marriage and divorce and related issues, such 
as support and child custody.  Rabbinical courts can also impose 
sanctions, including jail terms and restrictions against leaving the 
country, on individuals married in a Jewish religious ceremony who, 
in case of divorce, refuse to give their spouses a religious divorce 
("get").  In some cases, Jewish Americans, who entered Israel as 
tourists, have become defendants in divorce cases filed against them 
in a rabbinical court in Israel by their American spouses who are 
seeking a religious divorce that the defendants have refused to 
give.  These Americans have been detained in Israel for prolonged 
periods while the Israeli courts consider whether such individuals 
have sufficient ties to Israel to establish rabbinical court 
jurisdiction.  In one case, the rabbinical courts detained in Israel 
a Jewish American tourist who had been sued for support by his 
spouse in the United States.  Jewish American visitors should be 
aware that they may be subject to involuntary and prolonged stays in 
Israel if a case is filed against them in a rabbinical court.  This 
may occur even when the marriage took place in the U.S., and/or the 
spouse seeking relief is not present in Israel.  

Dual Nationality:  Israeli citizens naturalized in the United 
States retain their Israeli citizenship, and their children are 
considered Israeli citizens as well.  In addition, children born in 
the United States to Israeli parents acquire both U.S. and Israeli 
nationality at birth.  Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, 
are subject to Israeli laws requiring service in Israel's armed 
forces.  U.S.-Israeli dual nationals of military age who do not wish 
to serve in the Israeli armed forces may contact the Israeli Embassy 
to obtain proof of exemption or deferment from Israeli military 
service before going to Israel.  Otherwise, they may not be able to 
leave the country without doing military service.  Israeli citizens, 
including dual nationals, must enter and depart Israel on their 
Israeli passports.  (Note:  U.S.-Israeli dual citizens must enter 
and depart the U.S. on their U.S. passports.)

Palestinian-American citizens with residency rights in Gaza or the 
West Bank are subject to the same regulations as other resident 
Palestinians.  This normally requires them to depart these areas 
with Palestinian travel documents or (for residents of Jerusalem) 
laissez-passers with re-entry permits approved by the Israeli 
Ministry of Interior.

Registration:  The State Department advises American citizens who 
plan to be in the region for a substantial period of time to 
register at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv or the U.S. Consulate 
General in Jerusalem.  When registering, U.S. citizens can obtain 
updated information on travel and security in the area.

 No. 97-169

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated January 22, 
1997, to provide new information about travel documentation for 
Palestinian Americans, and to update the sections on entry/exit 
requirements, terrorism and security, and arrest and detentions.
