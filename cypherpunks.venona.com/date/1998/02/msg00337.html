&gt; &gt;One can "disrupt" the water supply by just making a credible assertion that

&gt; Psychops?

Yes, psyops (no ch) - the most venerable field of information warfare.

&gt; That doesn't work when you have sufficient health-orgs and telecomm
&gt; to get the word out that the water's ok.

By the same reasoning, a bomb threat won't get a building evacuated if
the authorities can check whether the bomb is there...

A psychopath like Guy Polis could just call a TV station and claim that
he put some poison in the water supply which would take a few days to
test for.

&gt; Actually, a lot of people drink bottled water here :-) but
&gt; the 10 million kilos of shit excreted by LA every day would
&gt; build up pretty fast.

NYC is one of the few major cities where the tap water is good enough to
drink and actually tastes good.

&gt; Electric power is probably as vunerable as waterways, despite
&gt; conscious efforts to make the grid redundant.  Of course
&gt; both are controlled by computers, as uncle sam is realizing.
&gt; In LA, all it takes to create a looting riot is to cut electricity
&gt; to the city's alarm systems...

One could use brute force and just blow up enough redundant towers...
Or short them with a kite. :-)

&gt; Major freeway intersections are closed down 2-3 times a year in LA
&gt; due to bomb threats, which are usually just threats -no bombs are found.
&gt; You can snarl the roads very easily at the right time of day, since
&gt; the roads' bandwidth is already exceeded and congestion persists after the
&gt; clog is removed.

NYC has pretty good public transporation... I don't think a terrorist can
do a lot by screwing up the traffic.

I recall that there was a bunch of bomb threates at Salomon Brothers last
year, right after Guy Polis was fired from his contractor job.  Do you
suppose the psychotic pedophile did it?
