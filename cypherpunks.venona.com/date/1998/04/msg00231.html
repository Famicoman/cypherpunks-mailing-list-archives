&gt; It seems to me that the chief impediment standing in the way of the
&gt; Internet becoming a propaganda and marketing tool suitable for use
&gt; and control by a few rich and powerful business entities is the 
&gt; comparatively inexpensive and easy access of millions of users to
&gt; the same technologies available to megacorporations.
&gt; 
&gt; History itself leads me to suspect that the money and power moguls
&gt; will use a variety of real and imaginary issues to place greater
&gt; monetary burdens and access restrictions on many aspects of the
&gt; Internet and Web, particularly those that have commercial potential.
&gt; 
&gt; A current example is the attempt by various Telecos to raise the cost
&gt; of access for other businesses, citing alleged burdens placed on their
&gt; resources by ISPs at the same time that they are scrambling to enter
&gt; the same market by undercutting their competitors.
&gt; The Great Teleco Resource Crisis will undoubtedly be mirrored at some
&gt; point in the future by the Great Internet Bandwidth Crisis. I suspect
&gt; that although it will be as bogus as the Telecos' current imaginary
&gt; crisis, it will come at a time when the major players have divided up
&gt; enough of the infrastructure pie among themselves to be unanimous in
&gt; their nod-and-wink agreement as to the severity of the crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; Undoubtedly, this will be just one of a variety of crisis in which 
&gt; will require restrictive legislation and cost-increasing regulations
&gt; that will save bandwidth for future children and protect adult citizens
&gt; from the extreme danger of engaging in commerce with other average
&gt; adult citizens such as themselves.
&gt; It seems to me that the *only* way that the Internet can be kept from
&gt; being used as just another tool for herding the masses into larger and
&gt; more efficient feeding pens is to enable and empower the citizens to
&gt; freely and safely control their own financial and commercial destiny
&gt; in their Internet transactions.
&gt; The more accessible and widespread the control over one-to-one monetary
&gt; transactions, the more difficult it will be for a few entities to lead
&gt; the citizens around by financial rings run through their noses.
&gt; 
&gt; The government currently has a variety of budgetary axes held over the
&gt; heads of the citizens, such as federal funding and grants in which
&gt; money taken away from the citizens is returned to them on a statewide,
&gt; local or individual basis only upon conditions that involve giving up
&gt; rights and liberties that are due them.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to resist being herded by a myriad of legal, licensing and
&gt; regulatory 'axes' into increasingly global feeding pens, the citizens
&gt; will need access to tools which allow secure financial transactions with
&gt; differing levels of identity versus anonymity available to them.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason that major business has not yet been able to divide up the
&gt; financial pie available through the Internet is the excessive amount
&gt; of resources that they need in order to compete for the attention of
&gt; Internet users, given that average citizens are providing equal or
&gt; better information and services for free or for a low cost.
&gt; The sooner that the masses are able to engage in free commerce with
&gt; one another via the Internet--whether it be giving Grandma Jones a
&gt; dollar for her cookie recipies, or engaging a student across the
&gt; continent in private research in return for money, for goods or 
&gt; for services--then the sooner the masses will scream loud and long
&gt; when government or corporate entities threaten to take this ability
&gt; to be self-sufficient away from them.
&gt; 
&gt; Those who wish to circumvent the loss of privacy, liberty and freedom
&gt; that they forsee as being possible on the Internet need to realize 
&gt; that most of those who are not currently empowered to manifest those
&gt; possibilities in their individual life will little recognize or
&gt; protest the 'present' loss of those 'future' possibilities.
&gt; Unless there is a widespread dissemination of working tools accessible
&gt; to the average citizen, then the future will be controlled by those
&gt; with the funds and resources to limit financial transactions on the
&gt; Internet to a self-defined 'way things are.'
&gt; 
&gt; "Teach a man to buy his fish from you, and you'll feed yourself for
&gt;  a lifetime."
