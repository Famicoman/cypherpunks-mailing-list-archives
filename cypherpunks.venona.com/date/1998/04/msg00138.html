 WIRELESS INDUSTRY SETS NEW GROWTH RECORD:
 11,270,301 NET SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN 1997 
 ==========================================================
 
 <A  HREF="http://www.wow-com.com/professional/whatshot">http://www.wow-com.com/professional/whatshot</A>
 "America's love affair with the wireless phone is as passionate as

 ever," observed Thomas E. Wheeler, President and CEO of the Cellular
 Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) in releasing the
 Association's latest Semi-Annual Data Survey.  As of December 31,
 1997, there were 55,312,293 wireless phone subscribers in the United
 States.  (CTIA estimates that there are nearly 58 million subscribers 
as of today's date.) This is a net growth of 11,270,301 subscribers-a 
12- month record. More people using wireless phones mean
that customer bills are down and company revenues are up.  Click link

 TELEPHONE INDUSTRY GROUPS JOIN IN ASKING FCC TO RESOLVE WIRETAP ISSUES
 
 <A  HREF="http://www.wow-com.com/results/professional/news/">http://www.wow-com.com/results/professional/news/</A>
 The major telecommunications associations in the United States have
 joined together to ask the Federal Communications Commission to
 resolve the dispute between the industry and the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation over new wiretap requirements. The industry groups are
 committed to assisting law enforcement agencies in carrying out all
 court-ordered wiretaps, but they argue that the FBI is requesting
 surveillance capabilities that go beyond the law.
