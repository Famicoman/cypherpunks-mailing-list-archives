<P><FONT FACE = "Arial" COLOR = "#FF0000" SIZE = "2"><B>DO YOU WONDER IF SOME OF THESE THINGS WORK??</B>
<P><FONT FACE = "Arial" COLOR = "#000080" SIZE = "2"><B>You see it again and again because it WORKS!!  See the message at the bottom!</B>
<P><B>     This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.  Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the  investigation of the program described below  to see if it really can make people money.  If you saw it, you know that their conclusion was that, while most people did not make the $50,000 discussed in the plan, most people were able to double and triple their money at the very least, in a short amount of time.  The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program.  This has helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home.  This is for real.</B>
<P><B>        The result of this show has been truly remarkable.  So many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before.  Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting to be a part of lately.  You will understand once you experience it.</B>
<P><B>         You may have thought this is a chain letter or a pyramid scheme (it's not).  You may have thought this is illegal  (it's not).  You may have just decided its not worth your time  (it is).   Whatever the reason you decided not to try it in the past, I ask you to reconsider.</B>
<P><B>        After reading the simple instructions below, you will be ready to start.   I think that once you begin to see your first orders in the mail, you will be surprised to learn just how many people are participating in this program.   I have been involved in the program for a long time but I have never seen so many people trying this out as I have recently.   This is good news because the more people that do it, the more everyone benefits.  If you ever thought of giving this a shot, now's the time to do it.  </B>
<P><B>        There's very little to lose, but alot to gain.  Besides making alittle extra cash each week, its fun to wonder how much money will be in your mailbox each day.  I wish all of you could know the feeling I get each day after work as I go to my p.o. box.  Its exhilerating!</B>
<P><B>        Just read over the letter below.  It will make starting a breeze.  Hope to hear from you soon.</B>
<P><B>                                        </B>
<P><B>                                                                                                     Jenny C.   Grand Junction, CO</B>
<P><B>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>	      My advice to you is that you save this letter (or print it) for a time.  The idea is very simple, but it definitely takes a few times reading it over before it sinks in.   I am confident that if you read over this letter briefly once now, and once again whenever you get the chance,  you will begin to see the potential involved.</B>
<P><B>	      Most people do not respond to this letter immediately.  Take as much time as you need to let the idea fly around in your head alittle.</B>
<P><B>	      This is not a pyramid scheme.   Many people equate this program with illegal schemes that involve nothing but the transferring of cash.  The difference between a legitimate multi-level marketing program and a pyramid scheme is that in a pyramid, there is no money being exchanged for a legitimate product.  The law states this clearly.  Anyone who claims this program is illegal is misinformed in the area of retail law.</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	      In this program, the product is a  financial report that you can simply e-mail to someone  after they order it from you and send cash to you through the mail.   While the report can be sent easily to yout customers with the click of one button through e-mail, it is nonetheless a legitamate product which people choose to send you $5.00 to purchase from you.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>	     The other legal issue that most people ask about in programs such as this one  is the issue of tax legality.  The law is clear that all income must be reported to the government each year.  When customers send you cash, it is your responsibility to keep track of how much you are making and report this at the end of the year.</B>
<P><B>          </B>
<P><B>	    </B>
<P><B>          Following is a simple explanation of the system and simple instructions for you to follow to get started right away: </B>
<P><B>1)	you save this letter onto your computer in case you need it later</B>
<P><B>2)	you send $5.00 to each of the 4 people listed below to order a report</B>
<P><B>3)	each of those 4 people will e-mail you 1 report immediately </B>
<P><B>4)	you save these 4 reports onto your computer</B>
<P><B>5)	you go back to this original letter and move everyone's name down 1 level, removing the  person in the 4th position and putting your name and address in the 1st position</B>
<P><B>6)	you have this newly altered letter e-mailed to tens of thousands of people  (usually people pay a bulk e-mailer to do this for them to start)</B>
<P><B>7)	when people receive this letter you sent them, they will see your name and address as the 1st report slot and will send you a $5.00 order for it</B>
<P><B>8) when people order these reports, from you, you immediately e-mail it  to them (they will give you their e-mail address along with their $5.00)</B>
<P><B>          Thats it folks......its that simple......the $5 is yours!</B>
<P><B>	      You e-mail them the report by "copying" it out of the saved e-mail report you received from the person on the list in this letter, and "pasting" it into a new e-mail letter and sending it off....no problem.   After you get the hang of it, you can copy many letters into new e-mails very fast and send off many orders quickly.</B>
<P><B>	      The reason it works is that everyone involved has an incentive to help everyone else succeed.  The people you order the reports from will e-mail the reports to you immediately because they will profit when you profit.</B>
<P><B>          Each of the 4 people you order from also will be eager to answer any questions you may have and help you in any way they can so that you can start mailing copies of this letter out with their names on it along with yours.</B>
<P><B>	        I mentioned above that success in this system can be guaranteed based on simple statistical facts.   When you send out tens of thousands of advertisements (or pay someone to mail them out for you), you can be absolutely positively assured that a certain percentage will respond and send you $5.00 for the report.  The next fact is that the larger the mailing you have sent out, the more responses you will get.   </B>
<P><B>          Please understand this about this program:  It only takes an extremely small percentage of people to respond to your ad in order for you to make a profit.   This is because your advertisement (with your address or P.O. box on it) will be sent to such incredibly large amounts of people.  (A bulk e-mailer can send your letter out to thousands of people per hour.)  </B>
<P><B>              </B>
<P><B>		OVERVIEW OF OUR  ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM:</B>
<P><B>	    Basically, this is what we do:  We sell thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs us next to nothing to produce and e-mail.  As with all multi-level businesses, we build  our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (with your computer).</B>
<P><B>        Look at multi-million companies such as New Vision (a vitamin supplier).  We use the exact same method of multi-level selling they use.  The only difference is that our product is a financial report you can easily e-mail to someone, rather than costly vitamins.</B>
<P><B>	    The product in this program is a series of four businesses and financial reports.  Each $5.00 order you receive by regular  mail will include the e-mail address of the sender.  To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!...the $5.00 is yours!   It really is THAT simple!   Think about it...........</B>
<P><B>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY</B>
<P><B>The profits are worth it.  </B>
<P><B>So go for it.  Remember the 4 points and we'll see you at the top.</B>
<P><B>				******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******</B>
<P><B>This is what you must do:</B>
<P><B>1................  Save this letter onto your computer</B>
<P><B>2................Order all 4 reports listed and numbered from the list below.</B>
<P><B>               (For each report send $5.00 and your e-mail address on a piece of paper to each person listed.  When you order, make sure you  print your e-mail address clearly, and also be sure to request each SPECIFIC report.  You will need all four reports, because you will be saving them onto your computer and reselling them.)</B>
<P><B>      (You will receive the reports a few days later by e-mail.  Save them onto your computer)</B>
<P><B>3................  Now you have 4 financial reports saved on your computer.  These are  legitimate products that people will want to buy.  You are ready to start advertising  your product to tens of thousands  of potential customers. </B>
<P><B>4................  Take this letter and move everyone's name and address down 1 position.  The person in the 4th position gets erased.  Put your own name (make up a company name) and address (could be a home or PO box) in position 1.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>          At this point you have 2 options.  If you decide you want to advertise yourself, you need to obtain mailing lists and send this newly altered letter to as many people as you can to get people to order the report from you for $5.</B>
<P><B>         This method can be time consuming and costly. </B>
<P><B>         The second option is to pay a bulk e-mailer to mail out your letter for you.  They can send out your letter to tens of thousands of people for a fraction of the cost of the above method. This is the method we recommend and is by far the simplest and cheapest way to go.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>         When you use a bulk e-mailer, all you need to do is give them a copy of the original letter with the address you want your $5 orders to go to and they will do the rest.   If you are able to find a bulk e-mailer who is already involved with the program, they won't even need the original letter since they will already have it.</B>
<P><B>        There are many bulk e-mailers out there who will send out your letter for you.  You can find them by doing a search of the word "bulk e-mailer" on the internet.   There are many excellent companies out there who will mail for you, but you still must be alittle wary.  We have found that some companies don't send them out in a productive manner (w/out using fresh addresses or attaching other messages to yours)  and since there is no sure way to know exactly their methods, you're left wondering.  </B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	    The best of all scenarios is to have someone who is also involved in this program mail out your letters for you.  There are many private bulk e-mailers out there who send out this very letter with their names on the list because they know the potential involved.  There is a good chance that one of the people you will be ordering your report from will be able to bulk e-mail out your letter for you.</B>
<P><B>       When you order the report from the people on the list in this letter, they will e-mail you a report---if they bulk e-mail, they will probably include an offer to send your letters out for you. </B>
<P><B>	  There is a simple reason why it is best to have someone involved in the program bulk e-mail out your letters for you.  As mentioned before, it is difficult to verify that a company is sending out your letter in the most profitable way.  If the person sending out the letter is also involved in the program, they will understand the program and, best of all, they will do everything possible to see you get as many responses as possible because when you profit they will profit as well since they are on the list as well.  This gives the person an incentive to take great care in sending out your mail since they have alot to gain from it as well as you.  Other bulk e-mailing companies will not have this same incentive.</B>

<P><B>Here's the fun part:</B>
<P><B>                     Take a look at what is called the "multiplier effect" in marketing:</B>
<P><B>	      Let's say you decide to start small just to see how it goes.  Assume you advertise your letter until 10 people respond and send you $5.00.  Also assume that those 10 people also advertise until they get 10 people to order and send them $5.00.  	</B>
<P><B>	Assume this continues for everyone in your downline and observe the following results:</B>
<P><B>* 	10 people order report #1 from you and send you $5.00</B>
<P><B>				5  * 10 =  $50</B>
<P><B>*	 each of those 10 people advertise until 10 people order report #1 from them (since their mailing will have your name 	as #2, 100 people will also send you $5 each to order report #2)</B>
<P><B>				5  *  100=  $500</B>
<P><B>*	 each of those 500 people advertise until 10 people order report #1 from them (1000 people order report #3 from you 	and send you $5)</B>
<P><B>				5  *  1000=  $5,000   </B>
<P><B>*	 each of those 1000 people advertise until 10 people order report #1 from them</B>
<P><B>	(10,000 people order report #4 from you and send you $5)</B>
<P><B>				5  *  10,000=  $50,000</B>
<P><B>                            </B>
<P><B>				$50,000  +  $5,000  +  $500  +  $50   </B>
<P><B>	Total =  $55,550</B>
<P><B>       </B>
<P><B>        A bulk e-mailer can send your letter out to thousands of people in one night.  The above scenario holds true if only 10 people out of those thousands respond.  This program is a study in statistics.  A certain percentage WILL respond and send you $5.</B>
<P><B>*****T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******</B>
<P><B>This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule</B>
<P><B>of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll</B>
<P><B>lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great</B>
<P><B>opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do</B>
<P><B>choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way</B>
<P><B>to financial security.</B>
<P><B>			Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS</B>
<P><B>My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost</B>
<P><B>accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.</B>
<P><B>When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail." I</B>
<P><B>made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and</B>
<P><B>percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my</B>
<P><B>supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun</B>
<P><B>of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't</B>
<P><B>work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50</B>
<P><B>responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was</B>
<P><B>shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a</B>
<P><B>believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   I did have seven more</B>
<P><B>years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe</B>
<P><B>it all to MLM.</B>
<P><B>			Frank T., Bel-Air, MD</B>
<P><B>I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any</B>
<P><B>doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked</B>
<P><B>with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely is! IT</B>
<P><B>WORKS!!!</B>
<P><B>			Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC</B>
<P><B>The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest,</B>
<P><B>lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a</B>
<P><B>short time. I was approached several times before I checked this out. I joined</B>
<P><B>just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money</B>
<P><B>required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks,</B>
<P><B>with money still coming in.</B>
<P><B>Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.</B>
<P><B>Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to</B>
<P><B>participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial</B>
<P><B>investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough</B>
<P><B>orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my</B>
<P><B>medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got so</B>
<P><B>overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more</B>
<P><B>money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this</B>
<P><B>deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply</B>
<P><B>isn't a better investment with a faster return.</B>
<P><B>			Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI</B>
<P><B>I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I</B>
<P><B>shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get</B>
<P><B>another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11</B>
<P><B>months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than</B>
<P><B>$41,000 on the first try!!</B>
<P><B>			D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN</B>
<P><B>This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will</B>
<P><B>soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The</B>
<P><B>only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake,</B>
<P><B>and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck</B>
<P><B>and happy spending!</B>
<P><B>			Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA</B>
<P><B>ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO</B>
<P><B>FINANCIAL FREEDOM!!!</B>
<P><B>       There is no guarante that you will make $50,000 each time, but its nice just to have some help with the rent or to have a few bills taken care of each month.  This program is fun to be a part of. We hope to hear from you soon!</B></P>
