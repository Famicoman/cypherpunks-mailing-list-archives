&gt; 
&gt; Ex-CIA Officer Charged with Spying
&gt; 
&gt; By James Vicini 
&gt; 
&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A disgruntled former CIA officer has been arrested on
&gt; spy charges
&gt; alleging he passed secrets to two foreign nations about how the agency
&gt; eavesdropped on their
&gt; coded communications, U.S. officials said Friday. 
&gt; 
&gt; Douglas Groat, 50, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency for 16 years
&gt; until being fired
&gt; in 1996, also was charged with trying to extort more than $500,000 from the spy
&gt; agency in return
&gt; for not revealing secrets to foreign governments. 
&gt; 
&gt; During a brief court hearing, a lawyer for Groat entered a not guilty plea to
&gt; the five charges, two
&gt; of which carry a possible death penalty. The case was the latest spy scandal to
&gt; rock the CIA in
&gt; recent years. 
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis said after the hearing that Groat participated during
&gt; his CIA career
&gt; in classified covert operations aimed at the penetration of cryptographic
&gt; systems of foreign
&gt; governments. 
&gt; 
&gt; He allegedly disclosed national defense information concerning the targeting
&gt; and compromise of
&gt; the cryptographic systems of two unidentified foreign governments to those
&gt; governments, she
&gt; told reporters outside the courthouse. 
&gt; 
&gt; The indictment alleged that he handed over the secrets to representatives of
&gt; the foreign nation
&gt; "with intent and reason to believe that said information would be used to the
&gt; injury of the United
&gt; States and to the advantage of a foreign nation." 
&gt; 
&gt; "The alleged unauthorized disclosure of these activities could have a
&gt; significant impact on the
&gt; national security of the United States," said Lewis, whose office will
&gt; prosecute the case. 
&gt; 
&gt; "This case involves highly sensitive classified information that could have a
&gt; serious impact on
&gt; the national security of the United States. In short this is a serious
&gt; espionage case," she said. 
&gt; 
&gt; The alleged espionage took place in late March and April 1997 while the alleged
&gt; extortion
&gt; scheme began in May 1996 and lasted until February 1998, the officials said.
&gt; Groat was
&gt; arrested by FBI agents without incident on Thursday. 
&gt; 
&gt; After prosecutors warned that Groat may try to flee the country, Chief U.S.
&gt; District Judge Norma
&gt; Holloway Johnson ordered Groat held without bond until next Thursday, when
&gt; there will be
&gt; another hearing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Prosecutor Eric Dubelier told the judge that Groat had been trained by the CIA
&gt; "in traveling in
&gt; false identification and deception." 
&gt; 
&gt; He said Groat possessed sensitive intelligence information which could cause
&gt; "grave damage"
&gt; to national security if disclosed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Groat, who was dressed in dark-blue prison clothing, stood before the judge
&gt; during the hearing
&gt; with his hands behind his back. Groat once conferred with his court-appointed
&gt; lawyers, but
&gt; never said anything during the proceeding held under unusually heavy security. 
&gt; 
&gt; George Tenet, the head of the CIA, said in a statement the full extent of any
&gt; damage to national
&gt; security has yet to be determined. 
&gt; 
&gt; "The charges against Mr Groat are extremely serious," Tenet said. "His arrest
&gt; demonstrates that
&gt; the U.S. government will not rest in our efforts against those who would commit
&gt; espionage ...
&gt; nor will we be intimidated by threats of blackmail." 
&gt; 
&gt; Groat worked as a technical officer in the CIA's Directorate for Science and
&gt; Technology. He
&gt; last had access to classified information in 1993, when he has placed on
&gt; administrative leave. 
&gt; 
&gt; Officials said it will be up to Attorney General Janet Reno to decide whether
&gt; to seek the death
&gt; penalty in the case. They said the year-old investigation would continue. 
&gt; 
&gt; The case is the latest in a series of embarrassing spy cases involving the CIA.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and has pleaded guilty to
&gt; betraying at least 11
&gt; Soviet and East European agents working for the United States in one of the
&gt; most damaging
&gt; espionage cases in U.S. history. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ames, a career officer who spent much of his 31 years in the CIA in
&gt; counterintelligence, is
&gt; serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison. 
&gt; 
&gt; Confessed double-agent Harold Nicholson pleaded guilty last year to spying for
&gt; Moscow,
&gt; becoming the highest-ranking CIA officer convicted in a spy case. 
&gt; 
&gt; Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who uncloaked students he helped train for
&gt; undercover
&gt; missions, admitted collecting $300,000 from the Russians.
