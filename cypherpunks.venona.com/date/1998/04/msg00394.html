DATA FELLOWS STRIKES A MAJOR DEAL
A Prominent Scandinavian Telephone Operator Invests in Data Security 

Helsinki, Finland, April 28, 1998  -- Data Fellows, a leading provider of
Internet security solutions, has made a deal with the largest private
telephone company in Finland.  Helsinki Telephone Corporation has bought
F-Secure SSH to enhance the security of its Kolumbus Internet services over
public networks. Kolumbus is one of the largest providers of commercial
Internet services in Finland.

"Data security is a highly important consideration for us," says Mr. Vesa
Perttunen, Development Manager from Helsinki Telephone Corporation,
Kolumbus Services. "We evaluated the data security products available on
the market, and F-Secure SSH was the best we could find.  We particularly
appreciated the fact that the source code is available to us."

Says Mr. Tatu Vehmas, Sales Manager, from Data Fellows: "F-Secure SSH
leaves no room for security compromises.  Furthermore, it is the only
sensible tool for secure remote systems administration currently available
on the market. We are pleased that Kolumbus Services has chosen our unique
F-Secure SSH package."

The F-Secure SSH Package

F-Secure SSH products are based on the SSH security protocol. The SSH
protocol is an application level protocol with strong public key
authentication and 128-bit encryption.  It guarantees the simultaneous
authentication of both ends of the connection, the secrecy of the
transmitted information, and the integrity of the transmitted data.

F-Secure SSH Terminal provides the user with secure login connections over
untrusted networks.  It acts as a replacement for the telnet protocol.
F-Secure SSH Terminal fully supports VT100 terminal emulation.

F-Secure Tunnel creates a local proxy server for remote TCP/IP services.
The service can be one of the Internet protocols, pop, smtp (used by e-mail
software), http (used by Web browsers), etc., or almost any other TCP/IP
based service.  The local proxy server listens for a socket on the desired
port and forwards the request and data over the secure channel.  It then
instructs the F-Secure SSH Server to make the connection to the specified
service on the remote machine.

In addition to secure terminal connections and TCP/IP connection forwarding, 
F-Secure SSH Server provides tools to replace existing rsh, rlogin, rdist,
and telnet protocols.  These tools enable administrators to carry out all
remote systems administration tasks over secure connections.
