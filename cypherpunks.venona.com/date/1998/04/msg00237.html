I think some cypherpunk representatives should attend this seminar.
It's often useful to hear what the BXA is saying when they talk to
exporters instead of a court or the press.  You will probably learn
something about crypto export law, too.  If you have a portable
cassette recorder, see if you can record it for future reference "and
for others at my company".

I'd go, but I have a bunch of committments on that date.  Let me
know how it turns out!

Bureau of Export Administration - U.S. Department of Commerce
		     presents

		ENCRYPTION CONTROLS  

		   SAN JOSE, CA
	April 28, 1998 *  8:30 AM - 5:00 PM 
	  Hyatt San Jose * San Jose, CA

ENCRYPTION CONTROLS - As a result of the release of new rules
governing the export of encryption items previously controlled on the
U.S. Munitions List, the export licensing responsibilities were
transferred to the Department of Commerce (except those specially
designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for military
applications).

This full-day program is being held to instruct and assist the
exporting community with this change in jurisdiction. Representatives
from BXA and the National Security Agency (NSA) will explain: the
background and current U.S. policy, the main elements of the controls,
License Exception KMI and the licensing process for encryption cases,
and legislative initiatives and other issues to watch in the future.

WHO SHOULD ATTEND? - This seminar is designed for exporters, freight
forwarders, carriers, international trade consultants, attorneys, and
others who support and advise exporters. If your organization is
involved in a technology-related industry, especially computers,
electronics, defense goods/services, etc., this seminar is a must.
