It mystifies me as to why government FUD disseminators seem to think that
they can spread Fear, Uncertainty and Disinformation on the InterNet with
the same blatant disregard for the facts that they employ in feeding their
mainstream media pets.
The problem with the wild animals free-ranging on the InterNet, of course,
is that not all of them have yet been domesticated and de-fanged. They can,
and will, byte back.

The problem that the InterNet poses for those government administrations and
agencies that desire to extend the unconstitutional rule of fear and
oppression into its bosom is thus:
"The InterNet interprets censorship as damage, and routes around it."
~ John Gilmore

A mountain of lies by unethical, self-serving government entities is
incapable of blocking the access of the citizens to the millions of
molehills strewn about the InterNet which are capable of bringing the
garbage that the government buries underground to the surface, where the
sight and stench of it will be available to those who wish to know the
truth.

The government does not have the resources to intimidate and persecute the
millions of individuals who are capable of placing hard evidence of
government lies on their website, or of stopping the legal dissemination of
US Forbidden Information (TM) to foreign countries, such as Canada, and the
legal forwarding of it to a variety of countries around the world through a
Canadian ISP, such as Sympatico,

I amazes me that a US citizen is subject to imprisonment for sending the
same material to a foreign country that she can legally send to the email
addresses of foreign nationals and foreign embassy employees within the US.
It particularly amazes me that those who manage to get elected to high
office by promising to be 'tough on crime,' and who stress the need for the
citizens to be protected from savage crimes--such as, say...murdering those
in authority--by labelling as criminals and punishing those who do such
things, would be so eager to enact so many far-reaching laws that an
increasing majority of the citizens are, in fact, becomimg criminals and
thus have increasingly little to lose by resisting the government's declared
intention to punish them.

The government goes to great pains to convince the citizens that violence
and killing is justified when it is directed toward The Bad Guys (TM).
Well, when you become a criminal, guess who The Bad Guys (TM) are...
