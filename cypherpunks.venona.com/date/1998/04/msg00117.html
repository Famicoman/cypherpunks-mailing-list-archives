		WIN US$1,000,000 'BELMOR HOUSE'
		FOR JUST US$20 VIA THE INTERNET


For just US$20 there is a chance to scoop the fabulous prize of 'Belmor
House' - a US$1,000,000 FREEHOLD property in Oxford, England.

Entrants need not "want a house" in Oxford in order to ENTER AND BENEFIT from
this Contest as the Winner can SELL the US$1,000,000 HOUSE or RENT IT out for
a FIVE FIGURE yearly INCOME, or use it as a SECOND HOME.

The Winner gets the house mortgage-free with clear title and does not pay any
closing costs . . .  and the US$1,000,000 house is the Winner's to do with, as
the Winner wishes.  BUT TO WIN IT YOU NEED TO ENTER the Contest . . .

Entrants can download Entry Form, Contest Rules, Drawings, Photographs and
Read all about Edwardian 'Belmor House', in historic beautiful Oxford by
entering:

	            <A  HREF="http://www.win-a-property.com/">http://www.win-a-property.com/</A>

The idea is to RAISE MONEY for CHARITY by giving away all profits after the
deduction of the property value and costs.  The Entry Fee is non-refundable
as after costs the money raised is all donated to Charity.

This is the FIRST TIME EVER that on a worldwide basis a US$1,000,000
beautiful Edwardian property in Oxford, England has been offered on the
Internet as the prize in a Contest, which is valid where not prohibited by law, and may herald the start of a new trend to 'sell' property through the Internet.

To win 'Belmor', a 13-room five bathroom Edwardian house in prestigious
residential central north Oxford, Entrants need to:

	1.  Key in 50-to-75 words in English on
		"Why The Entrant Needs The House"
	2.  Key in full name and address
	3. Select payment of Entry Fee of US$20 on any
		 major credit card and press
		the button to send the Entry by email or by fax.

It is as easy as that on the Internet.

'Belmor House' has been valued unfurnished at US$1,000,000 by internationally
renowned estate agents, Savills.

The Winner of this US$1,000,000 house will be the Entrant whose Entry,
in the opinion of an independent panel of judges, is interesting, personal
and persuasive, telling "Why The Entrant Needs The House".

The Freehold property is the only prize.  There is no cash alternative.

Not a lottery or a raffle, the Contest has been structured by Solicitors from
London as a skill competition to comply with British law under the Lotteries
and Amusements Act 1976 and the British Codes of Advertising and Sales
Promotion.  A firm of Chartered Accountants is monitoring the Contest.  The
Contest money is being held in a special bank account and cannot be touched
until the close of the Contest.

Closing date is 30th June 1998 and the Winner will be announced on the
27th July 1998 on our website.
