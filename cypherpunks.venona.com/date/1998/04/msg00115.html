&gt; &gt;I think you should perhaps read a little more maboy...
&gt; 
&gt; I know I should, and I do.  Never claimed to be a guru or else, did I?  I
&gt; just said what I knew, ie. gave my opinion (even if I am a newbie), which is
&gt; something you obviously don't like.  Perhaps you didn't read (sic) that I
&gt; kept using "I think", "I believe", "I guess", etc. instead of "I STATE".
Perhaps you didn't read the 411 for the PGP-Mailing-List. I don't recall
it saying "Ask unrelated questions if your a newbie." IMO anyone
interested in "2600" groups can find 411 all over the www.
also there are alt.2600 newsgroups, as well as other places. I personally
wouldn't even mind if you kept it off the list and asked if I knew what
2600 is, but trying to "teach" ppl what you "think" 2600 is.. has no place
on this mailing list.

&gt; &gt;...with any "group" nowadays, there is a FAQ avaliable for
&gt; &gt;newbies etc (obviously like yourself).
&gt; ... others just know ever since... never were newbies, hey?
You don't know how to read?

&gt; &gt;They are not "supposedly hackers and phreakers". Aso the
&gt; &gt;debatable issure of exact translation of a hacker, IMO it
&gt; &gt;is anyone that has altered ANY program.
&gt; The issue of exact translation should be, perhaps, discussed on a grammar,
&gt; language, or else mailing list if it is to start a flame.
I have no interest in starting a flame, you have embarrased yourself well
enough.

&gt; &gt;p.s. If it wasn't for hackers, you wouldn't have the
&gt; &gt;technology you have.
&gt; If it wasn't for you... am I in front of a top developer or similar?  Sorry,
If I simply wrote the 2600 faq (which I didnt) it would have bettered
society, because idiots would have an idea what it is.

&gt; I didn't notice, all I can see is a squared 14'' screen.
Well, obviously you stumbled upon a keyboard as well, prematurely perhaps.

&gt; &gt;OH what you've read on the beloved www. I'd imagine you
&gt; &gt;read an article on a webpage full of sex ad banners as
&gt; &gt;well. I don't feel that I am an "outlawed hero" but I feel
&gt; &gt;I better society in various ways.
&gt; You see, you just imagine (as I "guessed, believed,..."), and that's a good
&gt; thing (even imagining with a sick mind...
&gt; sex add banners?).  As for bettering society... how? trying to scare people
&gt; away so that you are THE ONE with the know-how?
I'm not trying to "scare you away". (you'd know if I was "trying"). 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As I've already said, you have alot more reading to do.
&gt; I'm sure if we ever get to meet each other, you'll teach me a lot and
&gt; perhaps lighten me... meanwhile, I'll just try to learn away from those like
&gt; you, I'll leave psycotic tales for others, if you don't mind me to.
I'll help you with anything I can, off-list. In the meantime, read.

&gt; I never said or stated hackers or the like are to be prosecuted or else,
&gt; never tried to raise a moral nor
&gt; ethical argument about, I just posed a question on (personal) security.
Pretending you have an idea on what 2600 is not related to security.
(Although the 2600 group irnoically does).


&gt; Most of all I DID NOT try to raise a flame by annoying anyone.  If you are
&gt; up to it, or if you believe you are Robin Hood (or Rob Hack for this
&gt; matter), I don't give a monkey about it, just visit your psychiatrist, or
&gt; talk to a priest/ess if you have a religion, or wait for the green people to
&gt; come fetch you up.  As I've just said, I won't get involved on a flame with
&gt; you, so don't bother to answer, I won't do it at all.
Perhaps if you reply off-list or try stop trying to pull your head out of
toilet, I'll leave you alone.
&gt; 

&gt; I apologize to others on this list for this, but I felt I had to answer once
as all newbies do.

&gt; (no more, promised).
promise?
