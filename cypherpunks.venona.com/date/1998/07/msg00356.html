Well, I'm a happy camper. Single DES is dead as a
credible cipher. I feel *very* vindicated.

I called for the hit, RSA bankrolled it, and the
EFF pulled the trigger. DESChall and
Distributed.net did severe damage, but the Deep
Crack machine was the fatal blow.

While the possiblity of bruting DES has been
discussed at various times in and out of cpunks
for years (for example, see Adam Back's message
of 17 August 1995), my involvement started 22 July
1996, when I proposed a DES crack as a follow on
to the previous autumn's RC4-40 attack:

&gt;Any one up for a distributed brute force attack on
&gt;single DES? My back-of-the-envelope calculations
&gt;and guesstimates put this on the hairy edge of
&gt;doability (the critical factor is how many
&gt;machines can be recruited - a non-trivial cash
&gt;prize would help).

&gt;Peter Trei
&gt;trei@process.com
---------------------------

This got a flurry of responses, mostly positive,
including some in which Matt Blaze announced his
intention to build a hardware DES cracker.

-----------

Later that day, I had run some more numbers:

&gt;[...]

&gt;The fastest general purpose, freely available des
&gt;implementation I'm aware of is libdes. by Eric
&gt;Young. With this, I can do a set_key in 15.8 us,
&gt;and an ecb_encrypt in 95 us/block. That adds up to
&gt;about 9,000 keytests/sec (this is on a 90 MHz P5,
&gt;running NT).

[...]

This looked much too slow, and discussion trailed
off. I was still interested, and grabbed some x386
assembler by Phil Karn, and worked on optimizing
it for the Pentium.

It worked well. A few months later:

&gt;Subject: Can we kill single DES? 
&gt;     From: "Peter Trei" &lt;trei@process.com&gt; 
&gt;     Date: Tue, 1 Oct 1996 16:27:18 -6 

&gt;[...]
&gt;Unlike many cypherpunks, I actually write code
&gt;(:-). I took Phil Karn's DES386 as a starting
&gt;point, and modified it to run effiiciently on the
&gt;Pentium. The code I've written will run 14 round
&gt;DES (all that is required for a key test app) at
&gt;254,000 crypts/sec on a 90 MHz Pentium.
&gt;[...]

I had managed a better than 25x speedup. My
biggest innovation was a new method of producing
key schedules, which when applied for key search
purposes was a hundred times faster than the
canonical method [Perry doubled the speed by
suggesting the use of Gray codes.]

Later that month, I wrote to Jim Bidzos at RSA,
suggesting a DES challenge, using my prototype's
speed to demonstrate feasibility.  He was
interested, and the Symmetric Key Challenges were
born.

Soon other programmers (notably Svend Mikkelsen in
Dennmark) substantially improved on my speed - by
better optimization, and by clever shortcuts which
allowed earlier rejection of bad keys. A major
innovation was use of Eli Biham's 'bitslice'
algorithm, which tested large blocks of keys in
parallel. The speed of his initial implementation
was doubled by the work of Matthew Kwan in
Australia and Andrew Meggs, et. al. at
distributed.net.

By the end of the latest challenge, the fastest
software search engines had speeds (in clock
cycles per test) well over 100x as fast as my
original 10,000 cycle/key estimate.

Here's one more quote from the archives:

&gt;From: "Peter Trei" &lt;trei@process.com&gt; 
&gt;Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 12:55:24 -6 
[...]
&gt;Prediction: By the millenium, we'll have made
&gt;single DES look about as silly as 40 bit RC4 is
&gt;today.

Written well before I started to think about a DES
crack, this, at least, has come true.
