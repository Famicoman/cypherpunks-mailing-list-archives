&lt;&lt; I have been getting this list for a few days. I subscribed to this list in
 the hopes I could learn something about crypto, in particular the GPG
 project.  So far I have seen pretty much nothing about crypto or anything a
 person who is not high or crazy could understand. &gt;&gt;

Both help to make a hacker, from what I understand. :-)


&lt;&lt; This list is so messed up
 its hillarious.  I didn't want to add to the string of useless messages, but
 it doesn't look like anyone cares anyway.  I will be monitoring the list for
 any signs of intelligent conversation. &gt;&gt;

It may be because there are certain hackers getting inbetween those that want to actually say something, and the list.  Fact is, I just unsubscribed from this list, but my e-mail apparently didn't make it to the server.

Must be because I'm on AOL, 'right'?  ;-)

Here's another post that didn't seem to make it through-

&lt;&lt; &gt; WHY CANT I FIND ANY WHITE AMERICAN YOUTH ALBUMS ANYWHERE?

 Reason 1:  You're from AOL
 Reason 2:  You don't know where the caps lock key is
 Reason 3:  You're looking on the cypherpunks list for music.
 Reason 4:  You're from AOL &gt;&gt;

Tee, hee hee.

I didn't find it on Cypherpunks (I didn't even check Cypherpunks for it :-) ), it's from some media article.  It described a incident that happened when someone complained about someone elses loud music -

&lt;&lt; Patrol officers had 
 to bang on Joseph W. Wedemeyer's door for about 
 15 minutes before getting his attention, Capt. Robert 
 Linardi said. They charged him with disorderly conduct.
 
 The next afternoon, Linardi said, Wedemeyer confronted 
 his neighbor on the street. Linardi said Wedemeyer, 
 who is white, called the neighbor, who is black, a 
 racial epithet and said, "I'm going to kill you." ... &gt;&gt;

That's the kind of music you're talking about, 'right'?

I heard they were after Tom('s) DeLay(ed Resignation), but they missed.  Direct hits to his brains and his heart, though!  ;-)
