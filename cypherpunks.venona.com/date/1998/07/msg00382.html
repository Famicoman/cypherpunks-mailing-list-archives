This reads as real, not the mindless rehashing of almost'was that typically
characterizes the posts from "Linda Reed".

Linda, are you sure you didn't eat the drugs, and imagine you were a space
alien?

Reeza!

Text follows:


&gt;  A friend of mine did computer work for an Arizona neurologist who put
&gt;electrodes and steel plates in the skulls of monkeys, rabbits, etc., in
&gt;order to do brain-mapping (one of the major areas of mind-control 
&gt;research), in order to study Parkinson's Disease.
&gt;  The neurologist was approached by a research foundation that was very
&gt;interested in giving him a grant to work with children, instead of with
&gt;animals. This has become an acceptable area of experimentation (a quick
&gt;study of those involved easily links them to a variety of intelligence
&gt;agencies). Their offer was refused as a result of the format and structure
&gt;of the proposal obviously being geared more toward providing information
&gt;and results that had more to do with learning methods to control aberrant
&gt;behavior than with benefitting the proposed child subjects.
&gt;  After his refusal, his current grant was canceled, and he was again
&gt;made the offer, which he accepted.
&gt;
&gt;  Dr. Ewen Cameron, the Canadian MKULTRA mind-butcherer, was instrumental
&gt;in helping the CIA to see the benefit of taking an 'interdisciplinary'
&gt;approach to mind-control.
&gt;  Although Dr. Cameron's basic method was to combine a wide variety of 
&gt;medical, biological, psychiatric, anthropological, et al, methods using
&gt;his own limited knowledge, in your basic VoodooLeeches methodology, the
&gt;CIA and military intelligence agencies began consolidating the various
&gt;arenas of mind/human-conditioning research and experimentation by helping
&gt;to sychronize the research of a wide body of educational and research
&gt;professionals in divergent fields of expertise.
&gt;  As a result of directing the focus and evolution of the majority of
&gt;scientific and psychological research in North America through control
&gt;of the funding mechanisms and access to research publishing, the American
&gt;intelligence community has managed to merge the research community into
&gt;an integrated tool for delivering the information and results desired
&gt;by the Controllers for their own grand designs.
