In the 1950s, the Rockefellers reorganized the U.S. eugenics movement
in their own family offices, with spinoff population-control AND abortion
groups The Eugenics Society changed its name to the "Society for the
Study of Social Biology", its current name.
  With support from the Rockefellers, the Eugenics Society [England]
set up a sub-committee called the INTERNATIONAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD
FEDERATION, which  for 12 years had no other address than the Eugenics
Society.
  (Note: Margaret Sanger plays a central role in this PLANNED PARENTHOOD
network.
In her book 'PIVOT OF CIVILIZATION',  in reference to free MATERNIT
care for the poor, Sanger states: "Instead of DECREASING and aiming
to ELIMINATE THE STOCKS that are most detrimental to the future of
the race and the world it tends to render them to a menacing degree
dominant.")

First the empire, second the war against Nazism -- and even that
only to secure "our interests". The historical record after the war
bears out these priorities. Throughout the world, the British and
US governments installed those willing to cater to their
"interests", even when these were fascists or collaborators who the
war had supposedly been against. Throughout the world, Britain and
the USA destroyed those who stood in the way of their plans for
control, even when these resisters were the democrats and
anti-fascists who had fought alongside the Anglo-American forces.

I just saw this on one of the newsgroups:

"A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible and the Second
Coming of Christ; who frequently attends Bible studies; who has a high
level of financial giving to a Christian cause; who home schools for
their children; who has accumulated survival foods and has a strong
belief in the Second Amendment; and who distrusts big government. 
Any
of these may qualify [a person as a cultist] but certainly more than
one
[of these] would cause us to look at this person as a threat, and his
family as being in a risk situation that qualified for government
interference."
-Attorney General Janet Reno, Interview on 60 Minutes, June 26, 1994

No wonder the government views so many people as threats.

How does "qualified for government interference" square with the First,
Second, and Fourth Amendments?

(No doubt Janet also believes that belief in that pesky Fifth Amendment,
not to mention the rest of the Constitution, will cause the government
to
look at these wackos as threats and worth of "government interference."

I'm looking forward to the ear 2000 Meltdown. This fucked up country
needs
a low-level reformatting. And a million government criminals and welfare
addicts sent to the wall.

Long ago and far away, Adolf Hitler was talking to Hermann Rauschning
and
said, "The people about us are unaware of what is really happening

They gaze fascinated at one or two familiar superficialities, such
as
possession and income and rank and other outworn conceptions. As long
as
these are kept intact, they are quite satisfied. But in the meantime
they
have entered a new relation: a powerful social force has caught them
up.
They themselves are changed. What are ownership and income to that?

The fourth world war has begun
In Chiapas, the Zapatista National Liberation
Army issued no directives about the elections, choosing instead
to withdraw to the sheltering greenery of the Lacandona Forest.
&gt;From this sanctuary the head of the ZNLA, Sub-Commandant
Marcos, sent us this original and geostrategic analysis of the
new world picture.
by Sub-Commandant Marcos
* Zapatista National Liberation Army, Chiapas, Mexico

The defeat of the "evil empire" has opened up new markets, and the
struggle over
them is leading to a new world war - the fourth.

Unlike the third world war, in which the conflict between capitalism
and socialism
took place over a variety of terrains and with varying degrees of intensity,
the fourth
world war is being conducted between major financial centres in theatres
of war that
are global in scale and with a level of intensity that is fierce and
constant.

The third world war showed the benefits of "total war" for its victor,
which was
capitalism. In the post-cold war period we see the emergence of a new
planetary
scenario in which the principal conflictual elements are the growing
importance of
no-man's-lands (arising out of the collapse of the Eastern bloc countries),
the
expansion of a number of major powers (the United States, the European
Union and
Japan), a world economic crisis and a new technical revolution based
on information
technology.

Thanks to computers and the technological revolution, the financial
markets,
operating from their offices and answerable to nobody but themselves,
have been
imposing their laws and world-view on the planet as a whole. Globalisation
is merely
the totalitarian extension of the logic of the finance markets to all
aspects of life.
Where they were once in command of their economies, the nation states
(and their
governments) are commanded - or rather telecommanded - by the same
basic logic
of financial power, commercial free trade. And in addition, this logic
has profited
from a new permeability created by the development of telecommunications
to
appropriate all aspects of social activity. At last, a world war which
is totally total!

The new international capitalism renders national capitalism
obsolete and effectively starves their public powers into extinction.
The blow has
been so brutal that sovereign states have lost the strength to defend
their citizens'
interests.

The fine showcase inherited from the ending of the cold war - the new
world order -
has shattered into fragments as a result of the neoliberal explosion.
It takes no more
than a few minutes for companies and states to be sunk - but they are
sunk not by
winds of proletarian revolution, but by the violence of the hurricanes
of world finance.

The son (neoliberalism) is devouring the father (national capital)
and, in the process,
is destroying the lies of capitalist ideology: in the new world order
there is neither
democracy nor freedom, neither equality nor fraternity. The planetary
stage is
transformed into a new battlefield, in which chaos reigns.

Megalopolises are reproducing themselves right across the planet. Their
favourite
spawning ground is in the world's free trade areas. In North America,
the North
American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and
Mexico is
a prelude to the accomplishment of an old dream of US conquest: "America
for the
Americans".

Are megalopolises replacing nations? No, or rather not merely that.
They are
assigning them new functions, new limits and new perspectives. Entire
countries are
becoming departments of the neoliberal mega-enterprise. 

the financial centres are working on a reconstruction of nation states
and are
reorganising them within a new logic: the economic has the upper hand
over the
social.

In this new war, politics, as the organiser of the nation state, no
longer exists. Now
politics serves solely in order to manage the economy, and politicians
are now merely
company managers.

The world's new masters have no need to govern directly. National governments
take
on the role of running things on their behalf. This is what the new
order means -
unification of the world into one single market.
The unification produced by
neoliberalism is economic: in the giant planetary hypermarket it is
only commodities
that circulate freely, not people.

What we have
here is a destruction of the material bases of nation states, but we
also have a
destruction of history and culture.
Neoliberalism thus imposes the destruction of
nations and of groups of nations in order to fuse them into one single
model. The war
which neoliberalism is conducting against humanity is thus a planetary
war, and is the
worst and most cruel ever seen.

What we have here is a puzzle. 
The first of these pieces is the two-fold accumulation of wealth and
of poverty at the
two poles of planetary society. The second is the total exploitation
of the totality of
the world. The third is the nightmare of that part of humanity condemned
to a life of
wandering. The fourth is the sickening relationship between crime and
state power.
The fifth is state violence. The sixth is the mystery of megapolitics.
The seventh is the
multiple forms of resistance which humanity is deploying against neoliberalism.

Piece no. 1: The concentration of wealth and the distribution of poverty

The earth has five billion human inhabitants:
of these, only 500 million live comfortably; the remaining 4.5 billion
endure lives of
poverty. 
The gap between rich and poor is enormous: far from decreasing, social
inequalities are growing.

Piece no. 2: The globalisation of exploitation

the world capitalist system is
"modernising" the production, circulation and consumption of commodities.
The new
technological revolution (information technology) and the new revolution
in politics
(the megalopolises emerging from the ruins of the nation state) produce
a new social
"revolution". This social revolution consists of a rearrangement, a
reorganisation of
social forces and, principally, of the workforce.

The world's economically active population (EAP) went from 1.38 billion
in 1960 to
2.37 billion in 1990. A large increase in the number of human beings
capable of
working and generating wealth. But the new world order arranges this
workforce
within specific geographical and productive areas, and reassigns their
functions (or
non-functions, in the case of unemployed and precarious workers) within
the plan of
world globalisation. The world's economically active population by
sector (EAPS)
has undergone radical changes during the past 20 years. Agriculture
and fishing fell
from 22 % in 1970 to 12 % in 1990; manufacture from 25 % to 22 %; but
the
tertiary sector (commercial, transport, banking and services) has risen
from 42 % to
56 %. In developing countries, the tertiary sector has grown from 40
% in 1970 to
57 % in 1990, while agriculture and fishing have fallen from 30 % to
15 % (2). This
means that increasing numbers of workers are channelled into the kind
of activities
necessary for increasing productivity or speeding up the creation of
commodities

this "modern" capitalist production
continues to rely on child labour. Out of 1.15 billion children in
the world, at least
100 million live on the streets and 200 million work

The globalised
market is destroying small and medium- sized companies. With the disappearance
of
local and regional markets, small and medium producers have no protection
and are
unable to compete with the giant transnationals.

All this combines to create a specific surplus: an excess of human
beings who are
useless in terms of the new world order because they do not produce,
do not
consume, and do not borrow from banks. In short, human beings who are
disposable. Each day the big finance centres impose their laws on countries
and
groups of countries all around the world. They re-arrange and re-order
the
inhabitants of those countries. And at the end of the operation they
find there is still an
"excess" of people.

Piece no. 3: Migration, a nightmare of wandering

there is a proliferation of "regional wars" and "internal
conflicts"; capital follows paths of atypical accumulation; and large
masses of workers
are mobilised. Result: a huge rolling wheel of millions of migrants
moving across the
planet. As "foreigners" in that "world without frontiers" which had
been promised by
the victors of the cold war, they are forced to endure racist persecution,
precarious
employment, the loss of their cultural identity, police repression,
hunger, imprisonment
and murder.

The fourth world war - with its
mechanisms of destruction/depopulation and reconstruction/reorganisation
- involves
the displacement of millions of people. Their destiny is to wander
the world, carrying
the burden of their nightmare with them, so as to constitute a threat
to workers who
have a job, a scapegoat designed to make people forget their bosses,
and to provide
a basis for the racism that neoliberalism provokes.

Piece no. 4: Financial globalisation and the generalisation of crime

With the beginning of the fourth world war, organised crime has globalised
its
activities. The criminal organisations of five continents have taken
on board the "spirit
of world cooperation" and have joined together in order to participate
in the conquest
of new markets. They are investing in legal businesses, not only in
order to launder
dirty money, but in order to acquire capital for illegal operations.
Their preferred
activities are luxury property investment, the leisure industry, the
media - and
banking.

According to a UN report,
the involvement of crime syndicates has been facilitated by the programmes
of
structural adjustment which debtor countries have been forced to accept
in order to
gain access to International Monetary Fund loans (3).
So here we have the rectangular mirror within which legality and illegality
exchange
reflections. On which side of the mirror is the criminal? And on which
side is the
person who pursues him?

Piece no. 5: Legitimate violence of illegitimate powers

In the cabaret of globalisation, the state performs a striptease, at
the end of which it is
left wearing the minimum necessary: its powers of repression. With
its material base
destroyed, its sovereignty and independence abolished, and its political
class
eradicated, the nation state increasingly becomes a mere security apparatus
in the
service of the mega-enterprises which neoliberalism is constructing.
Instead of
orienting public investment towards social spending, it prefers to
improve the
equipment which enables it to control society more effectively.

What is to be done when the violence derives from the laws of the market?
Where is
legitimate violence then? And where the illegitimate?
The monopoly of
violence no longer belongs to nation states: the market has put it
up for auction.

However, when the monopoly of violence is contested not on the basis
of the laws of
the market, but in the interests of "those from below", then world
power sees it as
"aggression". This is one of the (least studied and most condemned)
aspects of the
challenges launched by the indigenous peoples in arms and in rebellion
of the
Zapatista National Liberation Army against neoliberalism and for humanity.

The new world police
wants national armies and police to be simple security bodies guaranteeing
order and progress within the megalopolises of neoliberalism.

Piece no. 6: Megapolitics and its dwarfs

But neoliberalism does not conduct its war
solely by "unifying" nations and regions. Its strategy of destruction/depopulati
on
and
reconstruction/reorganisation also produces a fracture or fractures
within the nation
state. This is the paradox of this fourth world war: while ostensibly
working to
eliminate frontiers and "unite" nations, it actually leads to a multiplication
of frontiers
and the smashing apart of nations.
The elimination of trade
frontiers, the explosion of telecommunications, information superhighways,
the
omnipresence of financial markets, international free trade agreements
- all this
contributes to destroying nation states and internal markets. Paradoxically,
globalisation produces a fragmented world of isolated pieces, a world
full of
watertight compartments which may at best be linked by fragile economic
gangways.

Mega-politics globalises
national politics - in other words it ties them to a centre which has
world interests and
which operates on the logic of the market. It is in the name of the
market that wars,
credits, buying and selling of commodities, diplomatic recognition,
trade blocs,
political support, laws on immigration, breakdowns of relationships
between
countries and investment - in short, the survival of entire nations
- are decided.

The world-wide power of the financial markets is such that they are
not concerned
about the political complexion of the leaders of individual countries:
what counts in
their eyes is a country's respect for the economic programme. Financial
disciplines
are imposed on all alike. These masters of the world can even tolerate
the existence
of left-wing governments, on condition that they adopt no measure likely
to harm the
interests of the market. However, they will never accept policies that
tend to break
with the dominant model.

Piece no. 7: Pockets of resistance

"To begin with, I ask you not to confuse resistance with political
opposition.
Opposition does not oppose itself to power but to a government, and
its fully-formed
shape is that of an opposition party; resistance, on the other hand,
cannot be a party,
by definition: it is not made in order to govern but... to resist."
(TomY s Segovia,
"Alegatorio", Mexico, 1996)

The apparent infallibility of globalisation comes up hard against the
stubborn
disobedience of reality. While neoliberalism is pursuing its war, groups
of protesters,
kernels of rebels, are forming throughout the planet. The empire of
financiers with full
pockets confronts the rebellion of pockets of resistance. es, pockets.
Of all sizes,
of different colours, of varying shapes. Their sole common point is
a desire to resist
the "new world order" and the crime against humanity that is represented
by this
fourth world war.

Whereas the ZNLA fights to defend national sovereignty, the Mexican
Federal Army
functions to protect a government which has destroyed the material
bases of
sovereignty and which has offered the country not only to large-scale
foreign capital,
but also to drug trafficking.

The possible shapes are as numerous as the forms of
resistance themselves, as numerous as all the worlds existing in this
world. So draw
whatever shape you like. In this matter of pockets, as in that of resistance,
diversity is
a wealth.

INTERNATIONAL CRIME CONTROL STRATEG

BACKGROUND

International crime is a serious and potent threat to the American
people at home and abroad.  Drug and firearms trafficking, terrorism,
money laundering, counterfeiting, illegal alien smuggling, trafficking
in women and children, advanced fee scams, credit card fraud, auto
theft, economic espionage, intellectual property theft, computer
hacking, and public corruption are all linked to international criminal
activity and all have a direct impact on the security and prosperity
of
the American people.

Americans spend billions of dollars annually on cocaine and heroin,
all
of which originates abroad; in 1997, there were 123 terrorist attacks
against U.S. targets worldwide, including 108 bombings and eight
kidnappings; each year, approximately one billion dollars worth of
stolen cars are smuggled out of this country; annually, U.S. companies
lose up to $23 billion from the illegal duplication and piracy of films,
compact discs, computer software, pharmaceutical and textile products,
while U.S. credit card companies suffer losses of hundreds of millions
of dollars from international fraud; and several hundred U.S. companies
and other organizations have already suffered computer attacks in 1998,
resulting in millions of dollars of losses and significant threats
to
our safety and security.

PURPOSE

The International Crime Control Strategy (ICCS) addresses this
increasing threat by providing a framework for integrating all facets
of
the federal government response to international crime.  This first
ever
strategy reflects the high priority accorded international crime by
this
Administration and builds on such existing strategies as the National
Drug Control Strategy and the Presidential Directives on alien
smuggling, counter-terrorism and nuclear materials safety and security.

The ICCS is also an important initiative in terms of enhancing the
ability of U.S. law enforcement officials to cooperate effectively
with
their overseas counterparts in investigating and prosecuting
international crime cases.  At the upcoming Birmingham Summit, G-8
leaders will discuss international crime as one of the most pressing
issues related to increasing globalization and rapid technological
and
economic change.  President Clinton will highlight the new ICCS in
underscoring the U.S. commitment to close cooperation with all nations
who are mobilizing to confront this increasing threat.

OVERVIEW

The ICCS is a plan of action containing eight broad goals with thirty
implementing objectives.  The ICCS expresses President Clinton's resolve
to combat international crime aggressively and substantially reduce
its
impact on the daily lives of the American people.

The Strategy's eight goals and related objectives are:

1.   Extend the First Line of Defense Beyond U.S. Borders by
(a) preventing acts of international crime planned abroad before

they occur, (b) using all available laws to prosecute select
criminal acts committed abroad, and (c) intensifying activities
of law enforcement, diplomatic and consular personnel abroad.

2.   Protect U.S. Borders by (a) enhancing our land border inspection,
detection and monitoring capabilities, (b) improving the
effectiveness of maritime and air smuggling interdiction efforts,
(c) seeking new, stiffer criminal penalties for smuggling
activities, and (d) targeting enforcement and prosecutorial
resources more effectively against smuggling crimes and
organizations.

3.   Deny Safe Haven to International Criminals by (a) negotiating
new
international agreements to create a seamless web for the prompt
location, arrest and extradition of international fugitives,
(b) implementing strengthened immigration laws that prevent
international criminals from entering the United States and
provide for their prompt expulsion when appropriate, and
(c) promoting increased cooperation with foreign law enforcement
authorities.

4.   Counter International Financial Crime by (a) combating money
laundering and strengthening enforcement efforts to reduce inbound
and outbound movement of criminal proceeds, (b) seizing the assets
of international criminals, (c) enhancing bilateral and
multilateral cooperation against all financial crime, and
(d) targeting offshore centers of international fraud,
counterfeiting, electronic access device schemes and other
financial crimes.

5.   Prevent Criminal Exploitation of International Trade by (a)
interdicting illegal technology exports, (b) preventing unfair and
predatory trade practices in violation of U.S. criminal law, (c)
protecting intellectual property rights, (d) countering industrial
theft and economic espionage of U.S. trade secrets, and (e)
enforcing import restrictions on certain harmful substances,
dangerous organisms and protected species.

6.   Respond to Emerging International Crime Threats by (a) disrupting
new activities of international organized crime groups,
(b) enhancing intelligence efforts against criminal enterprises,
(c) reducing trafficking in human beings and crimes against
children, (d) increasing enforcement efforts against high tech
and computer-related crime, and (e) continuing to identify and
counter the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures and new
technologies in high tech areas.

7.   Foster International Cooperation and the Rule of Law by
(a) establishing international standards, goals and objectives to
combat international crime and by actively encouraging compliance,
(b) improving bilateral cooperation with foreign governments and
law enforcement authorities, and (c) strengthening the rule of law
as the foundation for democratic government and free markets in
order to reduce societies' vulnerability to criminal exploitation.

8.   Optimize the Full Range of U.S. Efforts by (a) enhancing executive
branch policy and operational coordination mechanisms to 
the risks of criminal threats and to integrate strategies, goals
and objectives to combat those threats, (b) mobilizing and
incorporating the private sector into U.S. government efforts, and
(c) developing measures of effectiveness to assess progress over
time.

ICCS INITIATIVES

Highlighted below are ten Administration initiatives to further our
efforts to fight international crime.

1.  International Crime Control Act of 1998:  Proposed legislation
containing significant new law enforcement tools for the fight against
international crime.

2.  Comprehensive Threat Assessment:  A comprehensive assessment of
the
threat to the American people posed by international crime, to be
completed within six months.

3.  International Conference on Upholding Integrity Among Justice and
Security Officials:  An international conference to address upholding
integrity among key justice and security officials worldwide, to be
organized by the Vice President within the next six months.

4.  High Tech Crime:  An action plan, building on the work of the G
8
justice and interior ministers and the creation of the U.S. National
Infrastructure Protection Center, to protect interconnected U.S.
communications and information systems from attack by international
criminals.

5.  Border Law Enforcement:  A program to enhance border law enforcement
through deployment of advanced detection technology and investment
of
new resources.

6.  Financial Crimes:  A commitment to employ aggressively new tools
to
deny criminals access to U.S. financial institutions and to enhance
enforcement efforts against financial crimes.

7.  International Asset Forfeiture and Sharing:  A U.S. call for new
criminal asset forfeiture regimes worldwide and new asset forfeiture
sharing agreements with our international partners.

8.  OAS Treaty Against Illicit Trafficking in Firearms:  A program
to
work with our OAS partners to implement fully a hemispheric convention
to combat the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms,
ammunition and explosives.

9.  Economic Espionage and Theft of Industrial Property:  A commitment
to use the Economic Espionage Act to increase U.S. investigations and
prosecutions of individuals and companies who attempt to steal U.S.
proprietary information.

10.  Strategic Communications Plan:  A plan to engage the private
sector in assessing the impact of international crime on that sector
and in determining its appropriate role in countering this threat.
