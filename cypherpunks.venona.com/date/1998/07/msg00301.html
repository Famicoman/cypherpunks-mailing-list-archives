INTRODUCTION
&gt; 
&gt;      First there were pocket calculators, then personal memory
&gt; organizers (PMO's), and next fully operating computers the size of a
&gt; personal check book. 
&gt;        Now the latest device to join the personal electronic evolution
&gt; is a palm sized unit that fits easily in a shirt or purse pocket and
&gt; is unlike anything you've seen before. Called a GENDEX, it not only
&gt; keeps track of people data and personal appointments, it can also
&gt; track personal or business expenses and serve as a depository
&gt; and dispensary for real time monetary transactions over the Internet.
&gt; And for those with email, just have it forwarded directly to your
&gt; GENDEX.
&gt;         What strikes you first about the GENDEX is its size - just
&gt; seven inches by 3.5" and 3/8" deep - small enough to be carried almost
&gt; anywhere - like an "electronic wallet". The second thing that you
&gt; notice is its unusual keyboard - again, unlike anything else you've
&gt; ever seen or used.
&gt;         At first, the keyboard seems strange and undecipherable -
&gt; instead of the usual QWERTY layout in rows, the keys are arranged in a
&gt; circle on the small, one-finger keyboard, with the most common letters 
&gt; in the inner circle. It's strange until you begin to use it. As you
&gt; catch on to the pattern, you begin to see the benefit of the
&gt; one-handed, one-finger layout, and most people quickly attain fairly
&gt; high data entry rates with very little practice.
&gt;         But it's not only this unusual keyboard that make the GENDEX
&gt; different - and useful. Its the fact that the GENDEX can store,
&gt; receive, and transmit financial data and monetary units over any
&gt; financial network, including secure radio and Internet transmissions.
&gt; Imagine being anywhere, buying or selling anything, and being able to
&gt; complete the transaction with you hand-held personal bank. (In the
&gt; future, it will even include a bar code reader to scan in any item or
&gt; price!)
&gt;         The GENDEX has been designed with the computer illiterate in
&gt; mind. The keypad is simple looking with a minimum of entry keys, and
&gt; every action and transaction is prompted for the next step. Just
&gt; "follow the bouncing ball" and it steps you through anything you want
&gt; to do with a minimum of learning time.
&gt;         It's also designed to be used in any weather, dropped, sat on,
&gt; stepped on, etc. The unique patentable self locking case is
&gt; waterproof, shock proof, breakproof and, most importantly, idiot
&gt; proof...instead of reaching for your wallet, in the future, many
&gt; thousands of people will be reaching for their GENDEX. Programmed in
&gt; JAVA with user replaceable chip sets, the GENDEX is easily upgradable
&gt; as new features and uses come out.
&gt;         The universally-usable GENDEX Java software will hopefully be
&gt; available by the year's end. Until then, you'll just have to stay with
&gt; using old fashioned credit cards, hand written checks, and nearly
&gt; obsolete cash and currency. To check out a live demonstration of the
&gt; GENDEX and its functions, visit the GENDEX website at <A  HREF="http://gendex.net">http://gendex.net</A>.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ORGANIZER LOGIC REACHES UNDENIABLY EASY TO USE STATE
&gt;  
&gt;     Gendex organizer logic is now the most idiotproof and clearly easy
&gt; to understand organizer logic in the world. Thanks to the efforts of
&gt; an entrepreneurial team, a logical prototype has been crafted in the
&gt; Java programming language and is open for testing at
&gt; <A  HREF="http://gendex.net">http://gendex.net</A>. This was finally accomplished after many years of
&gt; logic design by some clearly ingenious persons.
&gt;      This new logic works with the seventeen key input and
&gt; classification system developed by DEXCOM over numerous iterations.
&gt; There are 4 main memory keys, 7 system keys, 4 arrow keys that move
&gt; the cursor or scroll the display, and YES &amp; NO keys. Each of the main
&gt; memory keys opens with a table containing all the main functions you
&gt; can do in that division of the memory organizer. Each of the
&gt; functions, when selected, opens into a list of variations. These are
&gt; called TABLES, and there are four, AGENDA, PEOPLE, MONEY and NOTES. 
&gt; 	Ease-of-use comes from consistent application of ENTRY, INDEX and
&gt; FIND system keys. HELP is ready to pop-up at any time to give the user
&gt; easy to understand directions and options.
&gt; 	By keying SYSTEM, Utilities like e-mail in/out, secure-unviolatable
&gt; memory storage upload, communications carrier select, edit
&gt; scratchpads, output port control, e-bank selection, proper
&gt; calculators, smart power monitors, thesaurus/dictionary, and language
&gt; translation are accessible within any memory function.
&gt; 	The demonstration on the website can be played with manually using
&gt; the selecting device and keying functional buttons. Soon a new control
&gt; panel will be added, so that the demonstration can be played
&gt; automatically by pressing the purposefully direct logic sequence keys.
&gt; The automatic links shall have a 
&gt; player piano effect - eventually more than 111 functional logic
&gt; strings  so that even the passive websurfer can instruct himself about
&gt; many things this unit does. 
&gt; 	The logical prototype works in newest browsers, and there is a
&gt; download assist button on the website to bring the latest browser into
&gt; your own computer.
&gt; 	What is happening now in DEXCOM is a team of five time-investing
&gt; engineers are working toward completing a logical prototype. That is
&gt; leading to completion of a working software product.
&gt; 	The next step for the company will be to license the Gendex logic
&gt; system for use to the makers of the many hard-to-use and complicated
&gt; handheld and PDA systems already in user's hands. The first company
&gt; product is a software disk that adds the friendly usable gendex
&gt; functions to products like the H-P 620 handheld.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Interested Parties:
&gt; 
&gt; DEXCOM USA Inc. is introducing its ultimate electronic personal memory
&gt; organizer (Gendex EPMO). Gendex keeps track of Agenda, Money, People
&gt; and Notes, and more. Gendex is the perfect vehicle for financial
&gt; networks sending money via secure data radio, and over the internet.
&gt; Gendex software will be available for purchase. It has all the
&gt; easy-to-use logical prompts, and on-line real-time help functions to
&gt; assist in all
&gt; forms of transactions and memory recording. No other product in the
&gt; market has all the ease of use and understandability built into it
&gt; that Gendex does. This is the breakthru. Nearly all the others are
&gt; expert systems requiring extensive training to use all functions.
&gt; Gendex hardware will be available before the year 2000. It is
&gt; waterproof, breakproof, and pocket sized. Its multichip module design
&gt; will be widely licensed for lowest cost to the consumer. The company
&gt; will brand name its own highest quality unit, and grade and distribute
&gt; components made by world class manufacturers working under our
&gt; lisences. Our designs utilize the latest technologies that can be made
&gt; accessible to mass markets. 
&gt; On the website is a fully animated gendex shell opening; it also now
&gt; working logical prototype.
&gt; Price per privately issued share of DEXCOM USA Inc. stock just
&gt; quadrupled to $4, and is approaching IPO, with the potential for an
&gt; eight way stock split.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; GENDEX.NET TO REORGANIZE CIVILIZATION
&gt; 
&gt; NEVER BE LATE 
&gt; The advanced timekeeping and AGENDA scheduling functions that make it
&gt; possible to schedule and remember one-time events, recurring events,
&gt; and even place events in someone else's schedule (if they don't
&gt; prevent you from doing so). This will eliminate a lot of potential
&gt; embarassment to those who may forget about where they said they would
&gt; be.
&gt; 
&gt; TELEPHONES
&gt; Thanks to internet telephony, and the presence of speaker &amp; microphone
&gt; on the unit, and headsets for the pocketsized gendex, both cellular
&gt; phones and home phones, and their networks, will have a lot less to
&gt; do. This is because internet telephony is practically free, even for
&gt; long distance calls.
&gt; 
&gt; PAPER MONEY
&gt; The hazards and time consuming processes of making change will be
&gt; replaced with the ease of sending money optically to smart cash
&gt; registers and vending machines, parking meters etc., with optical
&gt; interfaces to money registrars with radio outputs. (Of course, 'users'
&gt; are subject to national banking laws.)
&gt; 
&gt; ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER
&gt; People will be able to receive and pay bills, and send each other
&gt; money over secure data networks. Gendex has all necessary logic to
&gt; set-up and actualize transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; CREDIT CARDS
&gt; Credit organizations will become E-BANKs using Gendex hardware and
&gt; software, because it cuts costs. Until then, Gendex hardware has the
&gt; power to directly write money to mag stripe cards. Ultimately,
&gt; Gendex.net will send a lot of plastic to the scrap heap.
&gt; 
&gt; RIDECALL
&gt; Eliminates superfluous automobiles by providing people you like (based
&gt; on lifestyle) with rides to where they need to go, as you make money.
&gt; This is coordinated by Gendex.net. Meet new friends, too.
&gt; 
&gt; MONITORING THE HONESTY OF YOUR LOCAL BANK
&gt; Those who maintaing their files in CONVENTIONAL BANK ACCOUNTS
&gt; MANAGEMENT will be able to keep track of interest they should be
&gt; paying you, ATM costs, other banking costs and penalties to monitor
&gt; accuracy of your local bank.
&gt; 
&gt; TRADING AND SELLING OVER THE NET
&gt; Every kind of service or material goods will eventually be listed in
&gt; the Bought,Buy,Sell&amp;Trade INDEX. Gendex logic will enable everybody to
&gt; sell or trade their goods and services, through Indexers who are
&gt; already specialists in their respective fields. These Indexers do not
&gt; work for gendex.net, rather they remain independant, while gendex.net
&gt; takes a very small commission each time electronic banks transfer money.
&gt; 
&gt; FORMATS
&gt; Prompted data entry of frequently repeated questions, coupled with
&gt; radio access to remote data bases will eliminate clipboards and paper
&gt; forms used in all repetitive data entry used in professional purposes.
&gt; Gendex.net will create a library of tens of thousands of different
&gt; formats for use by government, industry, military, courts, medical,
&gt; and professionals in every walk of life. And these can be sent by
&gt; radio to the Thousands of typists working in data entry jobs will need
&gt; to find something else to do.
&gt; 
&gt; TAX DEDUCTIONS
&gt; Every taxpayer who can write off business expenses will never lose
&gt; expense records, and find many advantages with Gendex' advanced
&gt; recording capabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; PHARMACY.NET
&gt; Gendex prompted data entry and secure verification will eliminate the
&gt; problem of reading doctor's cryptic handwriting. From NOTES, doctors
&gt; specify treatments. A pharmacist in a van will come driving up to your
&gt; house to serve the prescription rendered by doctors.
&gt; 
&gt; MEDICAL HISTORY
&gt; Whatever ails you, and when, and how, can be recorded so that after
&gt; you're dead, and they do the autopsy, they will have something to go on.
&gt; 
&gt; TELEVISION INTERNET REMOTE CONTROL
&gt; Gendex EPMO hardware, with its highpowered bidirectional infrared
&gt; port, can replace the intelligent aspect of internet boxes designed to
&gt; bring internet via cable to people's living room televisions. 
&gt; 
&gt; SMART LOCKS ACCESS
&gt; In the future, metal door locks will be replaced with a glass plate
&gt; guarding an optically activated solenoid. This will enable smart
&gt; systems in buildings to record who passed thru a door, when, and/or to
&gt; execute decisions about who is authorized to pass. It can even require
&gt; remittance of money, or act as a time clock for workers. Gendex EPMO
&gt; hardware, with its bidirectional infrared port can handle all these
&gt; transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; TRUCKERS LOGBOOK
&gt; Over the road drivers will be able to accurately maintain records of
&gt; how much time they spent driving, and what happened at points of
&gt; delivery. With GPS attachment, trucker will always know where he is.
&gt; 
&gt; PROFESSIONAL TIME LOG
&gt; Consultants who charge in small increments for time spent advising
&gt; clients will benefit readily by the functions provided in this logic.
&gt; 
&gt; SPEAKING TRANSLATOR
&gt; An issued unit of Gendex hardware or software will typically handle as
&gt; many languages in its interface as one chooses to download.
&gt; Ultimately, Gendex is intended to be able to handle all of input of
&gt; characters in the users language, translation to another language like
&gt; English or Japanese, and speaking that language via its speaker to
&gt; listening "barbarians". 
&gt; 
&gt; You may argue that all these things are happening anyway, and indeed,
&gt; some of them are. The difference here is that gendexes can be given
&gt; away free to customers by financial institutions, in exchange for
&gt; placing cash on deposit.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
&gt; 
&gt; 	The automatic logical demonstration on the website displays more than
&gt; 59 logical functions. Actually, the number which will be programed is
&gt; about 385, well organized and all totally accessible. Our "nearest
&gt; competitor" in hardware (really, predecessor) 3COM PALM PILOT has only
&gt; 4 logical functions. 
&gt; 	Not only that, our hardware product exceeds all others because it is
&gt; pocketsized, waterproof, breakproof and most importantly, idiotproof.
&gt; Gendex hardware is an email machine that goes with you everywhere,
&gt; even underwater. It's application specific electronic design is user
&gt; serviceable and infinitely upgradeable. 
&gt; 	Gendex hardware is designed with a microphone and a speaker to make
&gt; telephone calls free over the internet. There is also a headset that
&gt; attaches to the lower bidirectional optical ports. 
&gt; 	Logically speaking, it is far easier to use Gendex than those
&gt; products which are not as well designed and thought out. Gendex
&gt; software has prompted data entry and on-line help, being designed for
&gt; the computer-illiterate, thus will replace QUICKEN and most any
&gt; organizer programs. 
&gt; 	Gendex Software, and later hardware, includes prompted logic to
&gt; handle electronic money transactions for on-line banks, and the user
&gt; can make transactions safely. The palm Gendex is being designed with
&gt; completely integrated dataradio (like a pager) and complete TCPIP for
&gt; transmissions of email and e-money over private networks, the
&gt; internet, wherever he goes, with no fear of losing his money
&gt; (depending on what security software is available and what e-bank he
&gt; uses).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; MAD VENTURE CAPITALIST WANTED
&gt; 
&gt; No sane venture capitalist would ever invest in DEXCOM. 
&gt; Sane venture capitalists believe that the publication of this website,
&gt; <A  HREF="http://gendex.net">http://gendex.net</A>, will awaken a giant sleeping gorilla. Its pretty
&gt; obvious that the moment DEXCOM begins to succeed, some giant Japanese
&gt; conglomerate or even Microsoft will create all sorts of knockoffs and
&gt; circumvent all of DEXCOM's patent rights, earned in 14 years on R &amp; D
&gt; unsupported by all but the scantiest investments from people who
&gt; should have known better than to waste their money on this, and loads
&gt; of sweat equity. The very-innovative big established companies, with
&gt; their risk taking daredevil unconventional creative engineers, would
&gt; rather do it themselves, than license the technology, in order to get
&gt; it all for themselves. Even Microsoft knows, it can walk all over
&gt; little companies with complete impunity. The sane partners of any MAD
&gt; venture capitalist who would even consider investing in this little
&gt; startup, will wisely tell them that this is a considerable risk with
&gt; little possible outcome in the way of capital gains. Its pretty
&gt; obvious that there is no more to this website that meets the eye at a
&gt; superficial glance. Not worth considering more because the sane
&gt; venture capitalist sees that if its not a complete fake, that this
&gt; must be just another remake, just another failure in the field of
&gt; personal electronic organizers. It's a shame that so many
&gt; unsophisticated people believe that DEXCOM could succeed. While its
&gt; true that the little company continues to draw support from advance
&gt; orders for its units, coming from little, uneducated and
&gt; unsophisticated future customers, every savvy high class venture
&gt; capitalist knows that its not little buyers who make money for a
&gt; company in the long run, its the money that venture capitalists waste
&gt; on entrepreneurs with sure-fire conventional ideas that makes them
&gt; rich. Don't invest in DEXCOM - you will not regret it!
