&gt;So today, I can write the following:

&gt;
&gt;As soon as I have a compiler and a target machine that can execute these
&gt;instructions, suddenly this is not speech.  However, before this
&gt;compiler and machine combo exists, event the electronic form of this is
&gt;speech!
&gt;
&gt;How could this be?

Gwin has written a phrase which deserves more analysis, IMO -- free
from political overtones if we want to be impartial. The phrase can
be reworded as:

  "source code is a device, that actually does a function"

The difference and importance here is between syntatic and semantics. 

Your 4-instruction source code above is not a device today -- it
cannot perform any function. It has only syntatics, not the "how to". 
But, if there were a machine that could supply the proper semantics
(ie, actually perform the functions 1-4) then your source code above
would be a device.  Further, your source code may not be a device
today but be a device tomorrow.

As another example, bringing together one pound of inert metal with
another one pound of the same inert metal was not considered to be
explosive -- until U235 was used for the inert metal and properly
compressed. The difference is semantic, not syntatic. 

In that, Gwin is correct. Can the source code actually perform a
function?  Then, it is a device. Irrespective of the needed platform,
in the same way that an electric shaver is a device irrespective of
the local availablity of an appropriate power outlet.

IMO, even though I consider Gwin to be correct to a very large
extent, widespread use of crypto will not come from lifiting such
bans ... but from real need -- which does not outweigh the hassle,
today. The EFF has a wrong target there. 

Do you know how much Internet e-mail traffic is encrypted today?  Can
you believe less than 10%? Notwithstanding the rethoric exercises and
limelight it may provide, talking about encryption export bans may
not be as effective as desigining better and easier uses of strong
crypto -- that can then really drive market, legislation and courts. 

Need to use is a better key than need to know, it seems.

Cheers,

&gt;	Subject:	Junger et al.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	Reuters
&gt;
&gt;	3:40pm  6.Jul.98.PDT WASHINGTON -- A district court has
&gt;dismissed a law
&gt;	professor's challenge to US regulations strictly limiting the
&gt;export of
&gt;	computer data-scrambling technology.
&gt;
&gt;	Judge James Gwin ruled late Friday that the export limits, which
&gt;prevented
&gt;	Case Western Reserve University Law School professor Peter
&gt;Junger from
&gt;	posting the text of encryption programs on the Internet, did not
&gt;violate
&gt;	the constitutional right to free speech.
&gt;
&gt;	The Ohio court's ruling contradicts a California district court
&gt;ruling last
&gt;	August that said source code -- the instructions a person writes
&gt;telling
&gt;	the computer what actions to perform -- constitutes a form of
&gt;speech
&gt;	subject to First Amendment protection.
&gt;
&gt;	"Unlike instructions, a manual or a recipe, source code actually
&gt;performs
&gt;	the function it describes," Gwin wrote. "While a recipe provides
&gt;	instructions to a cook, source code is a device, like embedded
&gt;circuitry in
&gt;	a telephone, that actually does the function of encryption."
&gt;
&gt;	Neither ruling gave speech protection to compiled code, a
&gt;version of source
&gt;	code converted into an actual software program that could be run
&gt;on a
&gt;	computer.
&gt;
&gt;	The US government appealed the California decision and the issue
&gt;may
&gt;	ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
&gt;
&gt;	Civil libertarians and high-tech companies had hoped the court
&gt;would
&gt;	overturn the export limits on encryption technology, which uses
&gt;	mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it
&gt;unreadable
&gt;	without a password or software "key."
&gt;
&gt;	Once the realm of spies and generals, encryption has become an
&gt;increasingly
&gt;	critical means of protecting electronic commerce and global
&gt;communications
&gt;	over the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;	But law enforcement agencies, fearing encryption will be used by
&gt;terrorists
&gt;	and international criminals to hide their activities, have
&gt;instituted
&gt;	strict controls to limit the export of strong scrambling
&gt;products.
&gt;
&gt;	Lawyers opposed to the export rules said the Ohio court
&gt;misunderstood the
&gt;	difference between source code and compiled code.
&gt;
&gt;	"The Ohio court clearly doesn't understand the communicative
&gt;nature of
&gt;	software," said Shari Steele, an attorney with the Electronic
&gt;Frontier
&gt;	Foundation. "It's true that software helps to perform functions,
&gt;but it
&gt;	does so by telling computers what to do.... It certainly is
&gt;speech
&gt;	deserving of the highest levels of First Amendment protection."
