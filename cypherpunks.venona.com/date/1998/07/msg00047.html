This is your WAKE-UP call...

        ...INTRODUCING "THE BREAKFAST CLUB"

A ONE-TIME $39 PURCHASE CAN CONCEIVABLY EARN              
OVER $100,000 ANNUALLY FOR ANYONE WHO WILL 
WORK THIS PROGRAM!

DID I SAY WORK?  HA!      ...LET'S CHECK IT OUT!!!

What you are holding in your hand is perhaps the most exciting networking                             
opportunity to come down the pike, EVER!

There are numerous reasons why this is so, but lets first look at the most obvious....                   
... 30 BOXES OF CEREAL FOR $39,00........

The vehicle for this outstanding bargain is a coupon book with 30 vouchers, each                  
good for a box of your favorite Name Brand cereal delivered to your door with no                
shipping charges.

That translates into the lowest price for Brand Name Cereal on the 
planet! Period!!

Couple this with a networking opportunity using the most advanced compensation                   
plan in the industry, namely a 3 X 5 forced matrix with double matching bonus,                   
and it's a can't miss!!!!

Here are some other reasons that even for non-networkers spell BIG BUCKS!

1) A $39 one time purchase, one of the lowest in the industry.

2) Product recognition! A product almost everyone in the country is already                              
using, and paying too much for.

3) Mass appeal. Networkers have been searching for years to find a product                          
that would appeal to the masses. Breakfast cereal is as good as it gets! Our own  
local study showed 65 interested people out of 80 interviews! Many signed up        
on the spot!!!                                                                                                                     

4) Finally a product in MLM that offers real savings! The average box of cereal 
costs over $3 in the store, with many topping the $4 mark. Do the math. With our 
deal, the price for any cereal delivered to your door is $1.62. Yes, that's right, 
one dollar and sixty-two cents!!


WELL, THERE IT IS... ...I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THIS 
ONE IS GOING TO GO INTO HYPER-DRiVE IN A BIG 
HURRY, SO YOU BETTER GET YOUR TICKET AND 
HANG ON!!!   SIGN UP BELOW!

"THE BREAKFAST CLUB"
7267 AIRPORT ROAD
BATH, PA 18014


WHAT IS THE "BREAKFAST CLUB"?

"The Breakfast Club" is a network marketing company combining a substantial 
savings on a commodity which, almost all Americans use, with the income potential of 
network marketing!

This commodity is the Breakfast Cereals which we are all familiar with,

PRODUCT:

The current product is a "Name Brand" cereal coupon book. This coupon book 
offers "BIG" savings on your favorite cereals. Almost any cereal, delivered to your 
door with no shipping charge to you, for the low price of $1.62 (this price includes 
the cost of the coupon and the cost of the postage to send the order, blank for 
redemption)

EVEN CEREAL THAT COSTS OVER $4.00 IN THE GROCERY STORE 
CAN BE DELIVERED TO YOUR DOOR FOR $1.62

The coupon book contains 30 coupons, each good for a box of name brand cereal. 
What this means is that this is a guaranteed value of up to $120.00 for the cost of 
only $39 to you!

HOW DO I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY?
The answer is simple, as is the entire concept of this program. Just fill in the 
application / order form and send it with the proper payment to the address above. 
We will ship your coupon book to you within a few days, and you can send for your 
first box of cereal.

WHAT IS THE COMPENSATION PLAN?
Again, the answer is simple.

The compensation plan is a 3 x 5 forced matrix, with a double matching bonus 
feature, The matching bonus is earned when you personally sponsor 3 people, and the 
double matching feature kicks in when your second level is completed, not necessarily 
personally sponsored. This means that you would have 12 total people on these two 
levels in your organization. You would then match the matrix checks, of the three 
people whom you personally sponsored, and the matrix checks of those who they 
personally sponsored.

There is $1 on each level of the matrix which means that a complete matrix has a 
potential payout of $363, which is the total number of people. Therefore, the 
matching bonus feature gives you 3 more matrix payouts, or an additional $1,089 
when your personally sponsored people complete their matrix. The double match 
bonus will give you any number of additional matching checks, based entirely on the 
number of people that your personally sponsored people sponsor. Note: You match 
only the matrix payout of your sponsored and their sponsored. You never match a 
matching bonus!

The potential with this plan is awesome. If you follow this scenario you will see that 
the more people whom you sponsor, and whom they sponsor, will give you matching 
check after check, with almost no limit if you continue to sponsor. This program 
could literally pay out over $100,000 on only a $39 purchase.

MOST COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT 
                 "THE BREAKFAST CLUB"

Q. How can anyone deliver breakfast Cereal to your door for this price? 
($1.62)
A. The cereal is merely a vehicle for advertising. With the cost of direct mail 
advertising skyrocketing, and the readerslip relatively low for what is considered by 
most to be junk mail, this method of lost leader marketing is extremely desirable. 
Because people are waiting for their cereal, and they will be looking for their next 
order blank, the readership of the piggy-back advertising in the box is very high. Due 
to this fact, advertisers are willing to pay handsomely for this type of direct mail 
program.

Q. Is that why I can only use one coupon at a time, and must wait for my 
cereal to arrive before I can order again?
A. Yes. The advertising would do little good for anyone, nor could the cost of the loss 
leader be amortized if too much of the advertisers material should go to the same 
address in too short a time.

Q. Wasn't this program tried before, like around two years ago? What 
happened to it then?
A- Yes, it was tied in late 1995 into early 1996. The firm that was behind the concept 
did not anticipate the overwhelming response which they received. Coupled with the 
fact that they did not have the advertising dollars in place that they represented, 
collapse was inevitable.

Q. Why is it any different now?
A. The Company that is running this campaign is fully aware of the importance of 
keeping up with the demand. So much so, in fact, they have already put the data 
processing in place to scan the coupons into the system instead of waiting until they 
are overwhelmed. Also, and more importantly, they have the contracts in place from 
many advertisers to offset the cost of delivering the cereal. In other words, they have 
enough advertising dollars to cover the cost of every delivery.

Q. What about the network marketing part of this program? Does "The 
Breakfast Club" have control, or will there be competition?
A- Not only does "'The Breakfast Club" have an exclusive network marketing 
contract, but we will be collaborating with The Majestic Group, owners of the cereal 
book, on future books. There is a very bright future ahead for our distributors.

Q. Why is there no telephone customer service provided by "The Breakfast 
Club" for its distributors?
A. It boils down to one word, COST! This is not a high ticket, and until other 
products are ready to offer to the distributor base, we must control the expense of 
operation. This is not a complicated business, and most questions can be answered 
by this document. However, we anticipate that there could be questions that we can 
not answer to a distributors satisfaction here, so we will answer questions either by 
fax, mail or on a live conference call which will be conducted one hour each day, 
Monday through Friday. The number and time for this call is at the end of this 
document.

Q. The compensation plan is a 3 x 5 forced matrix with a "double matching 
bonus" feature. What is a double matching bonus and how does it work?
A. Double matching bonus simply means that you match the matrix checks earned by 
the people whom you sponsor personally, and those who they sponsor as well. This, 
of course, depends on your reaching the criteria which determine whether or not you 
will earn matching and double matching bonus.


Q. What is the criteria to earn matching and double matching bonus, and how 
does it fit into the marketing plan?
A. The criteria for matching and double matching bonus is really very easy to 
understand, and not difficult to attain. In fact, the entire marketing plan is so simple 
you could explain it on a napkin in a restaurant. Here it is in a nutshell...... you sign up 
and purchase a coupon book for Name Brand Cereal. You personally sponsor 3 
who do the same and you qualify for matching bonus. Fill your second level, a total of 
9 more people, whether or not they are your personally sponsored, and you now 
qualify for double matching bonus.

Just by signing up and making your first purchase of a coupon book for $39, you are 
entitled to a revenue share of $1 per level, for each of 5 levels of purchasers just like 
yourself A 3 x 5 matrix has the potential when full to hold 363 customers, which will 
pay $363. Now here is where the fun starts. For every person whom you personally 
sponsor into the program you will match every revenue share check which they are 
paid, provided that you sponsor a total of 2 distributors personally. That means that if 
they fill their matrix, you will earn an additional check of $363. Here is the best part! 
If your personally sponsored distributor goes out and sponsors any number of other 
people, providing you meet the criteria for double match, you will be paid a revenue 
share equal to whatever they are paid, even if it is 5, 10, 50 or 100 people. This 
means that you can make many times the value of a full matrix in this program by 
sponsoring only 1 person who goes out and sponsors ma!
ny!! Do the math. Awesome!

Q. When will checks be issued?
A. We will caculate weekly, and pay revenue share weekly. The week will begin on 
Monday, and end on Friday. Checks will be cut and mailed by Wednesday every 
week.

Q. Why is there a charge for issuing checks?
A. Again the answer is COST. Because of the sheer number of checks which we 
anticipate sending out, we must make allowance for this expense. Remember, this is a 
low cost program with a relatively high revenue share potential. Consequently we will 
only send checks when they have calculated to be at least $12. After deducting the 
$2 check charge, we would be sending a net of $10. Also, since there will be a 
genealogy sent with every check, this charge will help cover it as well. Note: the 
charge will remain $2 as long as the genealogy is only one page. It will be an 
additional .50 for every page after the first.

Q. Are we required to sign and send in the "Terms and Conditions" 
document?
A. Yes, The terms and conditions of our program will be upheld, and it is important 
that you agree to them in writing or your application will not be accepted. Note: the 
newer application has a disclaimer which states that you have read and agree to the 
terms and conditions. This will allow someone to fax an application to a third party 
before they send in the actual signed document to the Company.

Q. What about our identification number for sponsoring purposes?
A. We will use your Social Security Number as your temporary ID# A new number 
will be issued to you and sent with your book. Our program can identify you either 
with your temporary number or your company issued number, so you can sponsor 
even before you actually receive your new number,

LOOK FOR YOUR ID# ON YOUR ADDRESS LABEL AND ON YOUR                              
WELCOME LETTER.


1) No applications will be accepted without the signed terms and       
conditions document, unless a new form is used and the disclaimer is signed.

2) No applications will be accepted if all the information is not present to allow 
proper entry into the computer system. Any applications received with incomplete 
information will be returned to sender. We are not mind readers nor are we 
omniscient. Also, applications which are illegible will be returned. We will not guess 
what is written on them.

3) Since there is no placement in this program there will be no orphan file created by 
placement problems. However, there could be occasions when someone sends in an 
application expecting their sponsor to do likewise, but he or she does not. We will 
hold the appplication for 5 business days, and if the sponsor application does not 
materialize, we will return the orphan application back to the sender.

4) Another situation which could sometimes happen is mail being lost. Here again, if 
the sponsor application does not arrive within 5 business days, we will be forced to 
return the orphan application.

5) We will always attempt to answer all questions in a timely and diligent fashion. 
However, we anticipate rapid growth and understand that there will be times when 
we cannot. We encourage you to get on the conference calls, or turn to your upline 
whenever you need information that you carmot get from the Company.

6) We will absolutely not tolerate any misrepresentation of our products or our 
program from any distributor. This will be grounds for immediate termination          
and loss of any revenue share.

7) Whenever we are about to release a new product into the matrix, we will notify 
everyone at least a month before. This notification will be as an announcement in   
your check envelope, with your cereal delivery, or as a fax on demand document.

8) Revenue share will only be paid on a product if you yourself own it. In other 
words, as we release different products into the matrix, if you do not own that 
product, you will not earn revenue share on it from downfine purchases. Remember, it 
is not a requirement to own all our products, but it will be your decision as to whether 
or not you wish to earn additional revenue share based on the new products,

9) You may note that on your genealogy reports, persons whom you sponsored 
yourself may show up as being sponsored by someone else. That is not a mistake in 
the program! In order for the computer to place people in the matrix, it must assign 
sponsorship. This does not take sponsorship away from you, but is merely the way in 
which the computer builds the matrix. When this occurs, you now become the 
enroller, which keeps the credit for personal sponsorship with you, where it belongs.

GOOD LUCK AND SEE YOU AT THE TOP!
