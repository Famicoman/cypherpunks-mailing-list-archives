&gt;I neglected to take into consideration that this attempt at revisionist 
&gt;history of the greatest President of the US in the 20th Century, perhaps 
&gt;in US history...
&gt;
    are you really calling this cretinous, brain dead sorry excuse for a
    human being who was not worth being spat upon by the crippled camel of
    a third-world pepophilic dictator with poor table manners, the
    greatest President in our history? 

    man, you're one sick puppy.

    are we talking about the same President?  really? FDR? the man who
    sold our country into perpetual slavery on 08 Mar 33?  4 days after
    he was inaugerated in a speech where he "warned" he was asking for
    emergency powers, even stronger than war time powers?

    who managed to coerce a Congress, not even given a chance to read 
    what they were signing, into a declaration of national emergency 
    so this so called American could suspend the constitution, amend the 
    WWI "trading with the enemy" act so the citizens of what was once 
    the USA were also included among the  enemy...? who pledged -us- and
    all our property into the servitude of the  Federal Reserve and its 
    private owners, of which more than 50% is foreign?

    the same man who forfeited our good faith and credit to the bankers
    in bamkruptcy so the U.S. is now subject to Admiralty law and flies
    the gold fringed flag of martial law in all its courtrooms?

    the same man who inaugerated the Executive Order provision which gives
    the President and Secretary of the Treasury the power to rule without
    Congress?  and to enshrine the executive order into part of the US
    Code (USC 963, I believe)? 

    who contracted with the international bankers to print paper money as 
    Federal Reserve notes for which he owed the bankers the cash he had 
    just printed plus interest while they used the cash to buy the T-bills
    (the instrument of indebtedness)? --and confiscated private gold at
    $20 an Oz --later setting the standard at $34/Oz so the insiders made
    a killing? 

    the same man who tried to pack the Supreme Court? 

    the same man who  ran for a third term on an isolationist platform
    romising every mother that her sons would not fight a foreign war 
    then diplomatically left Japan no option but to go to war? 

    the same man who left Pearl Harbor out of loop with no code books for 
    the Red or Purple code so the defining act to start America in the war 
    wasted the Pacific Fleet with its ammo in the warehouses to be blown 
    up, 2,000+ dead, and battleships lying on the bottom? 

    the same man who violated the law and defied Congress with the 
    Lend-Lease program, gave away half of Europe to Russia, handed Russia 
    Berlin?  the same man whose two closest advisers were communists?  

    I always wanted to believe Alger Hiss was innocent as his son Tony 
    was in my class at Harvard --he wasnt innocent, nor were the Rosenbergs 
    as the CIA had cracked the code but would not show it in court --they 
    even knew who handed over the trigger mechanism (never punished and he 
    left the U.S. after the Manhattan project and taught for many years at 
    Oxford).

    yep, good Ol' Uncle Joe Stalin's best friend, along with bankers like
    Schiff who financed the Russians. 

    it's no conspiracy that Prescott Bush was complicite, but left holding 
    the bag. when the U.S. in '42 confiscated Union Bank which was started 
    by George's grandfather Herbert Walker -that's why George ran away from 
    home, joined the air corps and became a war hero at 18. why was the
    bank grabbed --Union was a front for A.G. Farber and for Hitler
    --Walker and his friends had been funding Hitler since the early 
    twenties --why? greed and power. 

    it's no conspiracy; it's history, in black and white Universal news 
    reels.  

    FDR, the incestuous son of bitch (Eleanor was is cousin) should have 
    been shot for treason --along with Eleanor. McCarthy, a scum-bag  if 
    there ever was one, was far closer to the truth than he ever knew.

    wake up and smell the roses! they've been fertilized by the shit of
    Eleanor Roosevelt for many years --she's still crapping in the White
    House garden for the first bitch to read the tea rose leaves.  

    there are no conspiracies, just men behaving like they always do; the
    vulture capitalists is that they only back off when their fear exceeds 
    their greed.  politicians arent smart enough to back off their greed 
    and their thirst for power as they blasphemously take take the oath 
    of office.


&gt;this raving and ranting to take the name of FDR in 
&gt;vain...this dribble to take all of humanity's name in vain...this project 
&gt;to develop the Mother of All Conspiracy Theories, including figuring out a 
&gt;way to show the Big Bang is/was, all of it, every last bit, a conspiracy...
&gt;
    there are no conspiracies; it's nothing more than man fouling his own
    nest; the normal progression of history which no-one learns so they 
    repeat the same mistakes --the well-fed populace is too lazy to take
    an interest in their own government until it is too late.

    there is no left and right; there is no moral government; it's all
    about power and staying in power.  ever notice how reformers only
    stay reformers until they need to run for reelection and the money
    goes to those who play ball?

&gt;...well, it could be ciphertext for which I have not received the key for 
&gt;making into plaintext.  Someone please forward the key to me.
&gt;
    what key? there is no key... except "mene, mene, tikel, upharrison" 
    (or whatever it was on the wall).  just open your eyes and view the 
    sewer around you. the fertilizer in the fields is now distributing
    "radioactive" waste --effluent courtesy of your politicians.

    the U.S. is already an oligarchy, next comes the plutocracy, followed
    by the triumvirate, and then the emporer (maybe with clothes) -then
    there will be a winnowing and anarchy followed by tribal states. welcome
    to history, but few will live to see it run its course --America, the
    universally hated, will be the first to be plowed under when she can
    no longer bully or buy the -pax americanus-. and the men in power know
    that a hungry disorganized populace can be subjugated by a well fed
    army.

&gt;By the way, I'm really one of you guys.  I am just working a cover among 
&gt;the people who call themselves sane until you guys who really know the 
&gt;truth can get into a position reveal these eternal truths to the 
&gt;unbelievers.  he-he!
&gt;
&gt;Really.
&gt;
&gt;[if you think you see a crazy person, consider the very real possibility 
&gt;that what you are seeing is really a crazy person]
&gt;

    sorry, I really am crazy, but it's better to be crazy than insane.
