Or you could get back on your medication.

&gt; &gt; Never has a single missive opened my eyes so thououghly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First, I had always thought that libertarians were somewhat equivalent
&gt; &gt; to my personal philosophy of Rational Anarchism.  Thanks to your pearly
&gt; &gt; prose I now know that libertarians are not rational.  I attribute my
&gt; &gt; failure to notice this in the past to the plethora of
&gt; &gt; pseudo-libertarians (like Tim May) that have a brain and can say
&gt; &gt; something beyond "What I want is right and you are wrong".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Second, I now recognize fully the signs of masked inferiority.  Any
&gt; &gt; attempt to allow the unwashed masses access to computer technology is
&gt; &gt; met with contempt and belittlement.  Personally, I do not fear what
&gt; &gt; others may be able to accomplish if they have a tool that they have the
&gt; &gt; ability to use.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite your mentality, I resist the urge to hope that you should learn
&gt; from practical experience what is apparently eluding you. That would
&gt; probably take the general form of you being in an automobile accident and
&gt; getting killed because the idiot who stops to "help" you attempts to do
&gt; CPR the Hollywood way and tells somebody who actually knows what they're
&gt; doing that he can handle it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Because I expect people to have basic knowledge above and beyond clicking
&gt; a mouse, pushing buttons on a television remote, mixing vinegar and baking
&gt; soda, and learning CPR by watching Baywatch, I'm suffering from "masked
&gt; inferiority."
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for opening my eyes, Paul. I will now flush years of higher
&gt; education down the drain and become like the "common man" so I'm not
&gt; accused of exhibiting signs of "masked inferiority." When I'm trying to
&gt; wash mold off my house and make a "jiffy mold remover" by mixing ammonia,
&gt; chlorine bleach, and a plethora of other things, thereby releasing toxic
&gt; gasses and quite possibly causing the barrel it was in to explode throwing
&gt; shrapnel all over the block, I'll claim ignorance. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or maybe somebody can practice medicine by asking for "fifteen cc's
&gt; anaprovaline" in emergencies because they heard it on Star Trek. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or maybe I could use large quantities of butyric acid to scare dogs away
&gt; from my home. When the neighbors complain, I can claim ignorance. Of
&gt; course, the area might be uninhabitable for a while. Phew!
&gt; 
&gt; After all, ignorance is what is prized in this society. The techies are
&gt; just somebody to pay when you need them, and make fun of and assault the
&gt; rest of the time.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Third, reality has never seemed to be a strong-point with libertarians,
&gt; &gt; but now I see that the disregard for reality an asset in your book. 
&gt; &gt; Because the reality is that most of those poor folk out there can't use
&gt; &gt; UNIX.  Not won't, can't.  Their phobia does not allow it, just as your
&gt; &gt; phobia does not allow you to consider any possible way that they might
&gt; &gt; gain even a fraction of the power of the Information Age that you
&gt; &gt; already have.
&gt; 
&gt; So these people now are "victims" of a "phobia" which prevents them from
&gt; reading documentation and bothering to educate themselves. If you don't
&gt; want to claim ignorance, claim that you're a victim; it always works these
&gt; days.
&gt; 
&gt; They can gain all the power they want. It's when they walk in with an
&gt; assault rifle in each hand and start spraying the room randomly with
&gt; cluelessness-inducing ammo that people get mad.
&gt; 
&gt; If in doubt, claim you are a victim of this widespread epidemic known as
&gt; "phobia of clue."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Fourth, while I am a whore and will run or build any system that someone
&gt; &gt; is willing to pay me to, I do have my limits.  I know longer accept
&gt; &gt; contracts or employment related to the military and intelligence
&gt; &gt; communities.  Neither, do I sell my body.  I leave that to the wannabe
&gt; &gt; geeks like yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; I think you're suffering from denial, Paul, and that you're lashing out at
&gt; anybody who could be a threat to your business because of masked
&gt; inferiority.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Again, Thank you for opening my eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; No problem. Don't mention it.
&gt;
