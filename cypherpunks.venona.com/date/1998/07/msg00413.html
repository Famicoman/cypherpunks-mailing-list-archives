GodLess Capitalists - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
___________________________________________________

"Centralism is dead," says Hayek; however, according to Friedman, it 
is not so much centralism that is dead, but rather the futility, and 
subsequent genre, of centralism. Dialectic construction states that 
government is capable of truth, given that culture is distinct from 
sexuality. Gonzalo implies that we have to choose between the textual 
paradigm of discourse and dialectic cultural theory. It could be said 
that the primary theme of Fielding's essay on Saussurean semiotics is 
the failure, and hence the rubicon, of patriarchialist truth.

"Class is part of the collapse of reality," says Lyotard. In a sense, 
the example of dialectic construction prevalent in JFK is also evident 
in Heaven and Earth, although in a more mythopoetical sense. Habermas 
promotes the use of the textual paradigm of discourse to attack 
colonialist perceptions of language.

In the works of Vinge, a predominant concept is the concept of
neocapitalist consciousness. But Lacan uses the term 'Saussurean 
semiotics' to denote the role of the observer as participant. The 
subject is interpolated into a structuralist paradigm of expression 
that includes truth as a totality.

If one examines the textual paradigm of discourse, one is faced with 
a choice: either accept dialectic construction or conclude that 
expression must come from the masses, but only if the premise of 
semiotic theory is valid; otherwise, truth is part of the praxis of 
sexuality. Hughes holds that we have to choose between Saussurean 
semiotics and dialectic construction.
Milhon's critique of the textual paradigm of discourse suggests
that the task of the reader is social comment.

--Herr Doktor Prof. T.C. May, Ing.


  See, I told you Tim May knew about that sort of crap.

  Now, Greg Broiles told me that he knew T.C. May, and I'm no Tim May, 
and I don't know all those fancy, intellectual words, but I've never 
found anything that couldn't be adequately described using the eight 
words you can't say on the InterNet, so I'm going to tell you all
about why the GodLess Commies kicked the MindsOfTheMassesAsses so bad
that that RockyFeller figured that if he could discover the secret of
the BullShitVic Schtick, he could finally realize his dream of having
more Dogamned money than the Pope.

  Marx and Stalin and Lenin and Chairperson Mao knew all about that
1984 stuff about controlling the people by controlling the language
and symbolism. 
  They also understood, like I explained before, that you don't want
your NewOldLady looking at a picture of her old boyfriend while you're
sticking your dick in her, so all of his crap, like his old love-
letters and the shirts he left behind, has got to go.
  Even more, the GodLess Commies knew that it wasn't enough to just
throw the OldBoyfriend's shit out, you had to 'deconstruct' your
NewOldLady's memory of him, even if you had to wipe her fucking mind
out with electroshock and make her listen to tape-loops.

  That RockyFeller kind of knew that, since he was doing the couch-
circuit with all of the Movers&amp;Shakers around the globe, no matter
what their schtick was, but wasn't smart enough to figure out all of
that stuff on his own, and besides, he was pretty busy counting his
money, and that's why he paid the I.S.P.'s GodLess Commies to figure
out the best way to put the BullShitVic Schtick up the butts of the
masses via the medium of the media of Radiating Radio Waves.
  The Radio Project's GodLess Commies didn't have much money to count,
so it didn't take them long to figure out the obvious, which is that
you don't fuck with a winning game. So they figured that 'abolution
of culture' could be accomplished by making intellectual content of
the medium as close to zero as possible, and that they could 'determine
the new cultural forms' of the listeners by Pavlovian repetition which
would eventually lead to the listeners drooling on command.
  Of course, as always, the increasing 'alienation of the population' 
remained important, since people with a strong sense of belonging in
a family, community, social structure, etc., still had a picture of
their BoyFriend by their beside, figuratively speaking.
  The techniques to make people increasingly 'radio-minded' was to 
reach it's epitome in later years, with the invention of the TV-tray,
which enabled families to abandon any pretense, whatsoever, of their
family ties being stronger than their imaginary bond to Lucille Ball
and Ricky Ricardo. [WAS: Fuck mom! I LOVE LUC!]

  It was no coincidence that one of Franklin Delanor Roosevelt's main
avenues of application of Madison Avenue Plain Folk Imagery was his
FireSideChats on the medium which had become a RichCommieFeller tool
for seizing the hearts and minds of the masses.
  After all, FDR owed much of his power and success to Elanor knowing
whose ear to blow into in the Eclectic Communist Community of the day.
  The main difference between the Bolshoi Political Ballet in Russia, 
and the Communist TakeOver Of America, was that there was no need to
remove the heads of the politicians in power and the capitalist Money
Mongers, because the politicians and the MoneyMongers *were* the head
of the Commie/Fascist TakeOver Of America.

&gt; Subject: A Thousand Points Of Fight

&gt; federal government. Communism now represents a threat to no one in
&gt; the United States, while federal tyranny represents a threat to
&gt; EVERONE.

An all powerful federal government IS communism. Communism is the 
political theory that property ownership and management must be 
centralized under a single authority. While our current state is 
moving more toward a fascist approach, private ownership &amp; central 
mananagement, with the increasingly extensive federal management of 
private business &amp; behaviour. 


  See, I told you so...

An Exercise For The Reader #487:
  Call up an international arms dealer and tell HimOrHer that you 
need some guns and tanks, and stuff, to start a war or a revolution,
and that you don't have any money, but you'll pay HimOrHer after you
win.

  Right...
  The Movers&amp;Shakers (TM) don't fall for the old GoodLeader/BadLeader
crap that is pushed to the public. They have a foot in the door of
all of the major players backrooms and merely switch their 'allegiance'
to one or another of the players once the final outcome of the game
becomes obvious.
  Neither Lenin nor Hitler borrowed money from 'dad' to start their
war/revolution. They got the money from the ever-present SugarDaddies
who have adopted children scattered all over the globe. 

  Likewise, SugarDaddy's BigKids in the Military and Intelligence
Agencies may fight among themselves over who sits on SugarDaddy's
knee, but when those outside the family start butting in, then 
the CIA and the Mafia, for instance, call a truce to take care of 
family business.
  SugarDaddy loves his GoodKids and BadKids equally...

  Neither do the BigKids in SugarDaddy's CorporateEmpires let petty
little details like wars that their own children are fighting interfere
with BusinessAsUsual.

  for their tanks, through Brazil of course, after you bombed their
  ball-bearing factories.

  earned it..")

Indeed, Marx's final stage of classless society, "from each according 
to their ability to each according to their needs", implies a level of 
government management that was all but impossible during his lifetime. 
The technology required for this level of management now exists, and 
is being implimented.
"Classless society" has been achieved, not by the dissolution of 
classes, but by the development of technology to a level that can 
assign each individual into his own class. Technology now allows the 
optimum utilization of each individual by the state. 
Loners can voice their objections at the US Capitol...


  Fast Freddy 'Son of Speed' Burroughs illustrates that paying the
extra few bucks for a priority connection to the ClueServer pays off,
in the long run.
  He recognizes that somewhere, in an underground bunker, a Reptilian
Nazi is humoring his ScaleOfTen buddies by using the latest in secret
lavoratory developed technology to create a cross-clone being that
has the MindOfMarx, the BallsOfHitler, and the LipsOfGeorgeBush, 
which are intoning, "We *have* the technology!"

  All this shit was in 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre' in 1989, but
hardly anybody knew what the fuck was being talked about.
 (I could insert quotes that illustrate this, except I don't have
any copies of it, since ThievingFuckingMountieCriminalPricks stole
my computers, which is why I am in the middle of fucking them so
bad that they will never be the same, afterwards. I was minding my
own business, sitting at home telling the Truth over the InterNet,
when they decided they just had to fuck with me, so fuck them in
thier dirty, crimininal little assholes...)

  Anyway, what TXCSM said, in a nutshell, was that the success of
TotalWorldDomination being achieved by the Controllers was merely
dependent on development of the right tools, and tweaking them, and
that TV and the InterNet were the right tools.
  WebWorld &amp; The Mythical Circle of Eunuchs was just written as a
fun look at a possible FutureTimeLine&amp;SpaceWave, since The Xenix
Chainsaw Massacre had already said everything that needed to be
said, if one chose to listen.
  InfoWar was written mostly as a cross-communication tool between
Circle of Eunuchs Gorilla Cells, keeping one another updated on
each other's progress.
  Space Aliens Hide My Drugs is just a rambling, nonsensical diatribe
that results when you finally snap, and decide that any Reptilian
Nazi that fucks with you is going to be repaid in Spades, perhaps
even Aces&amp;Eights, since I am playing with a deck that is a little
*too* full, if you know what I mean.

  Regardless, to get back to answering the question that Declan, 
GodLessSchill of the TrilateralCPU, asked, about why I send this
crap to the CypherPunks...it is because those who make this list
their home instinctively know what I have been preaching since
1989--and no doubt some of them have been preaching it since
long before that--the InterNet is going to be the Final Frontier
of the Battle for Freedom and Privacy between the Controllers
and the Citizenry.

  The CypherPunks understand: 
"THE (TM) *have* the technology."

  WeTheSheeple have been getting their asses kicked on the
Frontiers of Rights &amp; Freedoms, without even seeming to 
realize, for the most part, that they are in a fight.
 
Fresh From The ClueServer:
  Even the Nazis didn't start the CattleCars openly rolling 
to the Auschwitz Spa &amp; Resort until they were in a position 
of total control.
  It is *not* OK that the government is taking away our rights
and freedoms, as well as our means to defend ourselves against
them, because they are *our* government, because they are the
GoodGuys, because they have GoodIntentions, because they are
only FuckingUsALittleBit(ForNow), because we are *comfortable*
and ThingsAren'tReallyAllThatBad(et)...

  Think about what *you* have done, personally, to guarantee
the continuation of your rights and freedoms.
  Think about whether you deserve any rights or freedoms.
(es, *deserve*...they ain't, contrary to popular opinion,
 free for the taking...)

  Think about why the government continues a WarOnDrugs which
has been completely ineffective in stopping drug use, in the
least, and has only resulted in the imprisonment of more of
our citizens than the most evil of dictators that the RoyalWe
point our fingers at, as well as high crime rates, and the
wholesale slaughter of our youth.
  Could it be because the government knows exactly what they
are doing, and *desire* these results? Good Guess!!!
  The same goes for the majority of the ills and evils that
are part and parcel of the road that our political leaders 
have led us willingly down. They are no more a mistake than
the technology of Radio and TeleVision being directed towards
mindless drivel, mass hypnosis and social control programming.

  While WeTheSheeple sell our souls, our independence, our 
rights and freedoms, for the comfort and security of being 
spoon-fed our reality, while being 'protected' from the
GreatEvils that the Controllers have promoted or invented
in both our MeatSpace and our MindSpace, They (TM) have
been busy little beavers, butchering minds and lives in a
quest to gain an extra inch, here or there, in the battle
for the minds of all of humanity.

  I want you to all rise from your chairs, open your windows,
and scream, as loud as you can,
  "I've got a DICK, and I'm not afraid to use it!"

  Well, OK, maybe that's not such a good idea, but you know
what I'm talking about, eh?

Anthrax - Smoke 'em if you got it...
