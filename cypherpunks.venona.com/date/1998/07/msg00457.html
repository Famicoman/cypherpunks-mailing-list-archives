RPK SECURITY ANNOUNCES "ENCRYPTONITE™": THE POWERFUL PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION TOOLKIT

The RPK Encryptonite™ Software Toolkit Version 3.0 Allows Developers to Easily Add Strong Security to Internet, Software, Hardware and Communications Applications

SAN FRANCISCO, CA. July 27, 1998 — RPK Security, Inc., announced today the release of its RPK Encryptonite Software Toolkit version 3.0.  Now with C++ implementations and  a Delphi VCL component, the RPK Toolkit provides integrators, developers and engineers with everything they need to quickly and easily incorporate fast public key encryption and strong security into their applications without extensive knowledge of cryptography.  RPK Security is a technology leader in strong and fast public key encryption for software, hardware and Internet applications. With development and distribution facilities outside of the U.S., RPK Security is able to provide its customers with a worldwide strong security solution that is available globally unlike competing products that are restricted by U.S. export regulations.
	The RPK Toolkit, a software implementation of the RPK Encryptonite Engine, allows developers to build custom applications with embedded strong encryption for information sensitive applications and industries such as the Internet, communications, legal, health care and financial services. The Toolkit provides a dramatic 40 percent improvement in engine initialization (compared with V2.1), which results in remarkably better application response times. In addition, the Toolkit will include in future releases a new "packet encryption" technique which is well suited for broadcast and multi-cast applications, especially on the Internet.
	 The RPK Toolkit is easy to use and manage, making it an attractive and readily accessible solution for developers of new applications. The RPK Toolkit includes sample applications, complete source code and comprehensive documentation. The core technology of the RPK Toolkit leverages the same mathematics behind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, a widely used algorithm for creating secure network-based communications systems, and is highly respected by security experts.

"I have reviewed the RPK public key cryptosystem and believe the algorithm to be secure and suitable for use in secure applications," said Fred Piper, cryptographer, Codes &amp; Ciphers Ltd.
	The RPK Encryptonite Engine provides a method of encrypting (also known as encoding) computer data or digital electronic signals to protect its contents against unauthorized surveillance.  RPK Encryptonite Engine is unique in that it combines all the benefits of other public key systems (authentication, digital signatures and digital certificates) with the speed of a secret key system into one algorithm. With the superior performance offered by RPK's Encryptonite Engine, applications requiring streaming data, sound, video or large numbers of transactions, such as credit card payments, receive instantaneous responses and secure communication links.
	"In response to customer requests for a variety of software implementations as well as custom hardware (chips), we now offer developers and engineers a multi-platform premium encryption product that is easy to use and offers flexible and scalable levels of security and performance," said Jack Oswald, president and CEO of RPK Security. "Because the RPK Toolkit is developed outside of the U.S., it is not subject to U.S. export laws which gives a tremendous advantage to international customers, allowing them to produce secure, fast and flexible systems."

Features of RPK Encryptonite Software Toolkit 3.0:
Eighty different levels of encryption security 
Global availability with strong encryption
Faster encryption and decryption of data files and streams 
Based on proven mathematics of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm
Easy to use object-oriented design
Extremely well suited to embedded applications
Less expensive to implement than competing products
