DATA FELLOWS PREMIERES F-SECURE VPN+
                              
New Software Line Offers IPsec-Based Strong Security for Mission Critical
Networks
        
Helsinki, Finland, July 10, 1998 -- Data Fellows, the global leader in
Internet security solution development, has begun shipping its new F-Secure
VPN+ product family.

Compliant with the IEFT's (Internet Engineering Task Force) latest IPsec
standards (Internet Protocol Security standard), F-Secure VPN+ provides a
peerless software - only solution for both large corporate networks and remote
or small office networking.  The product line supports several different
encryption algorithms, including triple DES (168-bit), DES (56-bit), Blowfish
(40-446 bit), and CAST128 (40-128 bit). All VPN+ products are centrally
administered with an easy-to-use policy management tool and they also
support centrally managed automated installation.

F-Secure VPN+ operates at the network (IP protocol) level, which is invisible
at the application and end-user level.  The product line does not require
special hardware, and the ordinary user does not even notice its presence
since it requires no changes to network applications or their configurations.
F-Secure VPN+ works in conjunction with existing routers and firewalls, off-
loading encryption functions from those devices. By combining the products in
the F-Secure VPN+ line, companies of any size can use either the Internet or
cost-effective public networks to create virtual private networks without
requiring special hardware.
	
The F-Secure VPN+ family consists of the following products: 
   
- F-Secure VPN+ Client,  which operates in Windows and Solaris workstations
and encrypts all data traffic from such a workstation to an F-Secure VPN+
Gateway, a server equipped with F-Secure VPN+ Server, or another
workstation equipped with F-Secure VPN+ Client.  
  
- F-Secure VPN+ Server, which operates in Windows NT or Solaris
servers and encrypts all data traffic from the server to workstations equipped
with F-Secure VPN+ Client.  

- F-Secure VPN+ Gateway, which encrypts all data traffic from a LAN
through a WAN using the IPsec protocol to other LANs, or to workstations
equipped with encryption software.  A user can connect to a VPN+ Gateway
using either another VPN+ Gateway or VPN+ Client.  

- F-Secure VPN+ Enterprise Gateway, which encrypts all data traffic from a
Local Area Network (LAN) through a Wide Area Network (WAN) using the IPsec
protocol to other LANs, and to workstations equipped with encryption software.
The Enterprise version allows simultaneous connections from both VPN+
Clients and VPN+ Gateway devices.  
   
 "What is revolutionary about F-Secure VPN+ is that a virtual
private network can now be built cost-effectively between just two
workstations," says Mr. Teemu Lehtonen, Product Manager for Data Fellows.
"This is great news for small and medium sized organizations. Large
organizations can also utilize F-Secure VPN+ to extend their corporate network
to sites outside the corporate domain." 

F-Secure VPN+ integrates fully with the recently-introduced Data Fellows'
F-Secure FileCrypto and F-Secure Anti-Virus products. Together, these
products offer the most complete security solution for modern corporations.
The products support centralized policy based management.

F-Secure VPN+ is available from Data Fellows' resellers around the world.
The products have been tested for interoperability with almost 20 other
vendors' (including Cisco Systems, IBM and Check Point) IPsec-standardized
products.
