This hearing has been "indefinitely postponed" due tothe realization of
some bright young thing that in this country, at least, private
corporations do not sponsor government hearings. perhaps this is a way to
raise some much needed reveneu, but for now it's a no-go.

&gt; Content: First Announcement/On-Line Congressional Hearing
&gt; 
&gt;      On July 26 at 9:30AM EDT, the Subcommittee on Telecommunications
&gt; and Finance of the U.S. House of Representatives will hold the first
&gt; Congressional Hearing ever held over a computer network.  The oversight
&gt; hearing on "The Role of Government in Cyberspace" will take place in
&gt; the Grand Ballroom of the National Press Club at 14th and F Streets,
&gt; N.W., Washington, D.C.  The hearing is open to the public. An open
&gt; house will be held from 3-5PM on the same day in the same location and
&gt; is also open to the public.
&gt; 
&gt;      Chairman Markey has asked that this historic occasion demonstrate
&gt; the potential and diversity of the global Internet.  Thirty Sparcstations
&gt; will be in the hearing room, allowing members of Congress, staff, and
&gt; their guests to read e-mail, use Gopher menus, read testimony in WAIS
&gt; databases, browse the World Wide Web, and otherwise use the resources
&gt; of the global Internet as part of the hearing.
&gt; 
&gt;      Some witnesses for the hearing will testify remotely, sending audio
&gt; and video over the Internet.  Audio and video of the hearing will also
&gt; be multicast over the Multicast Backbone (MBONE).  We are hoping that
&gt; C-SPAN and other traditional media will also carry the event.  *MORE
&gt; DETAILS ON MBONE AND OTHER WAYS TO WATCH THE HEARINGS REMOTELY WILL BE
&gt; FORTHCOMING SHORTLY.*
&gt; 
&gt;      One of the primary points that we are hoping to demonstrate is
&gt; the diversity and size of the Internet.  We have therefore established
&gt; an electronic mail address by which people on the Internet can communicate
&gt; with the Subcommittee before and during the hearing:
&gt; 
&gt;           congress@town.hall.org
&gt; 
&gt;      We encourage you to send your comments on what the role of government
&gt; should be in the information age to this address.  Your comments to this
&gt; address will be made part of the public record of the hearing.  Feel free
&gt; to carry on a dialogue with others on a mailing list, cc'ing the e-mail
&gt; address.
&gt; 
&gt;      Your cards and letters to congress@town.hall.org will help
&gt; demonstrate that there are people who use the Internet as part of their
&gt; personal and professional lives.  We encourage you to send comments on
&gt; the role of government in cyberspace, on what role cyberspace should play
&gt; in government (e.g., whether government data be made available on the
&gt; Internet), on how the Internet should be built and financed, on how you
&gt; use the Internet, and on any other topic you feel is appropriate.  This
&gt; is your chance to show the U.S. Congress that there is a constituency
&gt; that cares about this global infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt;      If you would like to communicate with a human being about the
&gt; hearing, you may send your comments and questions to:
&gt; 
&gt;           hearing-info@town.hall.org
&gt; 
&gt;      Support for the Internet Town Hall is provided by Sun Microsystems
&gt; and O'Reilly &amp; Associates.  Additional support for the July 26 on-line
&gt; congressional hearing is being provided by ARPA, BBN Communications,
&gt; the National Press Club, Xerox PARC, and many other organizations.
&gt; 
&gt;      Network connectivity for the Internet Town Hall is provided by
&gt; UUNET Technologies.
