According to Norman Hardy:
&gt; J. Michael Diehl wrote:
&gt;     I'm having a philosophical problem regarding when to sign someone
&gt;     else's public key.
&gt;  
&gt; It strikes me that while a public key may be properly associated with
&gt; someone that you know by sight it may more generally be associated
&gt; with an abstract reputation. Connecting a face to a public key may
&gt; be less useful than connecting a public key with someone that
&gt; I recognize by reputation. I don't know Stephen Wolff by sight
&gt; but I do know him by reputation and have conversed with
&gt; him by e-mail. If during these conversations we had exchanged
&gt; public keys, even thru insecure channels, then that would be
&gt; more reliable than exchanging keys with someone that I met
&gt; in person who claimed to be Steve Wolff but with whom I did not
&gt; have time to converse. Steve's reputation with me arose thru a book
&gt; he wrote. If he had included his private key there it would be
&gt; better yet. (Public keys had not been invented then.)
&gt; Having been influenced by Steve's book I would be inclined to
&gt; accept Steve's opinions in related areas, if they were signed
&gt; by his private key. I need not know what Steve looks like!

This is a good point, but I believe that eventually, people will want to sign
legal documents via pgp and such.  So being able to tie a pseudonym to a 
reputation to a public key to a REAL LIVE PERSON is very important.  I think 
that for many people, your attitude is one they can live with.  This is what I
was debating when I posted the original question.  But for others, your policy
may not be secure enough.  I'm working on a key-signing policy for myself which
I will make available via finger or request.  Laters.
