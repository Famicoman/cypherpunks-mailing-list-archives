&gt;Hello Mark,
&gt;        We're sorry for any misunderstandings caused by our e-mail.
&gt;I have appended a copy of our follow-up to Berkeley on this issue.
&gt;
&gt;Regards

&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;We've had a lot of feedback from various sites in response to our
&gt;e-mail to you last week referring to possible anonymous FTP abuse on
&gt;Berkeley hosts.
&gt;
&gt;We are concerned at the reaction that our e-mail caused. There's
&gt;obviously been a misunderstanding here and we wanted to follow-up with
&gt;you on this.  There was certainly no intent on the part of CERT to
&gt;make accusations of any sort.  We were simply trying to alert sites to
&gt;the possibility of activity that they might have concerns about.
&gt;
&gt;Our letter to you was one of many which we sent out to a number of
&gt;sites across the world in the form of an FYI of possible abuse of
&gt;their anonymous FTP areas.  We had been receiving complaints from
&gt;sites about wide-scale trading of commercial software on their
&gt;writable anonymous FTP areas.  During the process of helping sites to
&gt;secure their systems we were given copies of files left in abused
&gt;archives which indicated lists of hosts (and in some cases
&gt;directories) that intruders were using to trade of commercial
&gt;software.  We chose to contact the sites so that they could check
&gt;their systems and take any steps that they thought appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;There were several reasons why we didn't attempt to verify the
&gt;information.  There were a large number of hosts involved and with the
&gt;resources that we have available to us, it was not possible for us to
&gt;attempt to confirm the information on each host.  In any case, we felt
&gt;it wouldn't be sufficient to check for specific directories or
&gt;filenames on an archive, the whole archive would need to be checked
&gt;for writable directories and then some verification of the contents of
&gt;those directories would need to take place.
&gt;
&gt;Previously, we have found that sites we contacted with this type of
&gt;information, did find writable areas which are being abused.  In this
&gt;case some sites found such activity on their hosts, others stated that
&gt;the information was dated or incorrect.  In hindsight, we see that it
&gt;would have been better for everyone concerned in this case if we had
&gt;undertaken some initial verification of the information or issued an
&gt;CERT advisory instead of the individual letters.
&gt;
&gt;As so many sites are potentially vulnerable to this activity and may
&gt;be unaware that it exists, we've decided to put together a CERT
&gt;advisory on the topic and hope to issue it in the near future.  
&gt;
&gt;We're sorry if our original e-mail didn't clearly state our intentions
&gt;and was the cause of any misunderstandings.
&gt;
&gt;We'll follow-up with the various sites who have contacted us in regard
&gt;to our original e-mail to you, by passing them a copy of this letter.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
&gt;Moira
