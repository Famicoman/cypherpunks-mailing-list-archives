 &gt; From: Emmanuel Goldstein &lt;emmanuel@WELL.SF.CA.US&gt;
 &gt; Subject: File 1--Hacker testimony to House subcommittee largely unheard
 &gt; 
 &gt; What follows is a copy of my written testimony before the House
 &gt; Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. The June 9th hearing
 &gt; was supposed to have been on the topic of network security, toll
 &gt; fraud, and the social implications of the rapidly emerging
 &gt; technologies. I was asked to speak for those who had no voice, which
 &gt; translates to hackers and consumers. Instead I found myself barraged
 &gt; with accusations from the two representatives in attendance (Rep. Ed
 &gt; Markey D-MA and Rep. Jack Fields R-TX) who considered 2600 Magazine
 &gt; (of which I'm the editor) nothing more than a manual for computer
 &gt; crime. One article in particular that Markey latched upon was one in
 &gt; our Spring issue that explained how a cable descrambler worked.
 &gt; According to Markey, there was no use for this information outside of
 &gt; a criminal context. Fields claimed we were printing cellular "codes"
 &gt; that allowed people to listen in on cellular calls. In actuality, we
 &gt; printed frequencies. The difference didn't seem to matter - after
 &gt; explaining it to him, he still said he was very disturbed by the fact
 &gt; that I was allowed to keep publishing. It soon became apparent to me
 &gt; that neither one had read my testimony as there seemed to be no
 &gt; inclination to discuss any of the issues I had brought up. In a way,
 &gt; it was very much like being on the Geraldo show. Somehow I thought
 &gt; elected representatives would be less sensationalist and more
 &gt; interested in learning but this was not the case here. We got
 &gt; absolutely nowhere. Markey in particular was rude, patronizing, and
 &gt; not at all interested in entertaining any thought outside his narrow
 &gt; perception. It's too bad this opportunity was lost. There is a real
 &gt; danger in elected officials who don't listen to all relevant opinions
 &gt; and who persist in sticking to old-fashioned, outdated notions that
 &gt; just don't apply to high technology. You can look forward to more
 &gt; restrictive regulations and higher penalties for violating them if
 &gt; this mentality continues to dominate.
 &gt; 
 &gt; +++++++++++++++++++
 &gt; WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOLLOWS:
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for the
 &gt; opportunity to speak on the issue of the rapid growth and changes in
 &gt; the telecommunications industry.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      My name is Emmanuel Goldstein and I am the publisher of 2600
 &gt; Magazine, which is a journal for computer hackers as well as anyone
 &gt; else who happens to be interested in the direction that technology is
 &gt; taking us. We tend to be brutally honest in our assessments and, as a
 &gt; result, we do get some corporations quite angry at us. But we've also
 &gt; managed to educate a large number of people as to how their telephone
 &gt; system works, what kinds of computers may be watching them, and how
 &gt; they can shape technology to meet their needs, rather than be forced
 &gt; to tailor their existence to meet technology's needs.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      I am also the host of a weekly radio program called Off The Hook
 &gt; which airs over WBAI in New York. Through that forum we have
 &gt; discovered the eagerness and curiosity that many "ordinary people on
 &gt; the street" possess for technology. At the same time we have seen
 &gt; fears and suspicions expressed that would be unwise to ignore.
 &gt; 
 &gt; HOW TO HANDLE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY
 &gt; 
 &gt;      The next few years will almost certainly go down in history as
 &gt; those in which the most change took place in the least amount of time.
 &gt; The computer and telecommunications revolution that we are now in the
 &gt; midst of is moving full speed ahead into unknown territory. The
 &gt; potential for amazing advances in individual thought and creativity is
 &gt; very real. But so is the potential for oppression and mistrust the
 &gt; likes of which we have never before seen. One way or the other, we
 &gt; will be making history.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      I think we can imagine it best if we think of ourselves speeding
 &gt; down a potentially dangerous highway. Perhaps the road will become
 &gt; slick with ice or fraught with sharp curves. It's a road that nobody
 &gt; has gone down before. And the question we have to ask ourselves is
 &gt; what kind of a vehicle would we prefer to be in if things should start
 &gt; getting out of control: our own automobile where we would have at
 &gt; least some chance of controlling the vehicle and bringing it down to a
 &gt; safe speed or a bus where we, along with many others, must put all of
 &gt; our trust behind a total stranger to prevent a disaster. The answer is
 &gt; obviously different depending on the circumstances. There are those of
 &gt; us who do not want the responsibility of driving and others who have
 &gt; proven themselves unworthy of it. What's important is that we all have
 &gt; the opportunity at some point to choose which way we want to go.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Rapidly changing technology can also be very dangerous if we
 &gt; don't look where we're going or if too many of us close our eyes and
 &gt; let someone else do the driving. This is a ride we all must stay awake
 &gt; for.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      I am not saying we should be overly suspicious of every form of
 &gt; technology. I believe we are on the verge of something very positive.
 &gt; But the members of this committee should be aware of the dangers of an
 &gt; uninformed populace. These dangers will manifest themselves in the
 &gt; form of suspicion towards authority, overall fear of technology, and
 &gt; an unhealthy feeling of helplessness.
 &gt; 
 &gt; HOW NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN HURT US
 &gt; 
 &gt;      The recent FBI proposal to have wiretap capabilities built into
 &gt; digital telephone systems got most of its publicity because American
 &gt; taxpayers were expected to foot the bill. But to many of the
 &gt; non-technical people I talked to, it was just another example of Big
 &gt; Brother edging one step closer. It is commonly believed that the
 &gt; National Security Agency monitors all traffic on the Internet, not to
 &gt; mention all international telephone calls.  Between Caller ID, TRW
 &gt; credit reports, video cameras, room monitors, and computer
 &gt; categorizations of our personalities, the average American feels as if
 &gt; life no longer has many private moments. Our Social Security numbers,
 &gt; which once were for Social Security, are now used for everything from
 &gt; video rentals to driver's licenses. These numbers can easily be used
 &gt; to track a person's location, expenses, and habits - all without any
 &gt; consent. If you know a person's name, you can get their telephone
 &gt; number. If you have their phone number, you can get their address.
 &gt; Getting their Social Security number is not even a challenge anymore.
 &gt; With this information, you can not only get every bit of information
 &gt; about this person that exists on any computer from Blockbuster Video
 &gt; to the local library to the phone company to the FBI, but you can
 &gt; begin to do things in this poor person's name. It's possible we may
 &gt; want a society like this, where we will be accountable for our every
 &gt; movement and where only criminals will pursue privacy. The American
 &gt; public needs to be asked. But first, they need to understand.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      In Germany, there is a fairly new computerized system of identity
 &gt; cards. Every citizen must carry one of these cards. The information
 &gt; includes their name, address, date of birth, and nationality - in
 &gt; other words, the country they were originally born in. Such a system
 &gt; of national identity can be quite useful, but in the wrong hands it
 &gt; can be extremely scary. For example, if a neo-Nazi group were to
 &gt; somehow get their hands on the database, they could instantly find out
 &gt; where everyone of Turkish nationality lived. A malevolent government
 &gt; could do the same and, since not carrying the card would be a crime,
 &gt; it would be very hard to avoid its wrath.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Before introducing a new technology that is all-encompassing, all
 &gt; of its potential side-effects and disadvantages should be discussed
 &gt; and addressed. Opportunities must exist for everyone to ask questions.
 &gt; In our own country, nobody was ever asked if they wanted a credit file
 &gt; opened on them, if they wanted to have their phone numbers given to
 &gt; the people and companies they called through the use of Caller ID and
 &gt; ANI, or if they wanted to be categorized in any manner on numerous
 &gt; lists and databases. Yet all of this has now become standard practice.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      This implementation of new rules has resulted in a degree of
 &gt; cynicism in many of us, as well as a sense of foreboding and dread. We
 &gt; all know that these new inventions will be abused and used to
 &gt; somebody's advantage at some point. There are those who would have us
 &gt; believe that the only people capable of such misdeeds are computer
 &gt; hackers and their ilk. But it just isn't that simple.
 &gt; 
 &gt; UNDERSTANDING COMPUTER HACKERS
 &gt; 
 &gt;      To understand computer hackers, it helps to think of an alien
 &gt; culture. We have such cultures constantly around us - those with
 &gt; teenage children ought to know what this means. There are alien
 &gt; cultures of unlimited varieties throughout the globe, sometimes in the
 &gt; most unexpected places. I'm convinced that this is a good thing.
 &gt; Unfortunately, all too often our default setting on whatever it is we
 &gt; don't understand is "bad". Suspicion and hostility follow and are soon
 &gt; met with similar feelings from the other side. This has been going on
 &gt; between and within our cultures for as long as we've existed. While we
 &gt; can't stop it entirely, we can learn to recognize the danger signs.
 &gt; The best way that I've found to deal with an alien culture, whether
 &gt; it's in a foreign country or right here at home, is to try and
 &gt; appreciate it while giving it a little leeway. There is not a single
 &gt; alien culture I've encountered that has not been decidedly friendly.
 &gt; That includes deadheads, skateboarders, Rastafarians, and hackers.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      When we talk about computer hackers, different images spring to
 &gt; mind. Most of these images have come about because of perceptions
 &gt; voiced by the media. Too often, as I'm sure the members of this
 &gt; committee already suspect, the media just doesn't get it. This is not
 &gt; necessarily due to malice on their part but rather a general lack of
 &gt; understanding and an overwhelming pressure to produce a good story.
 &gt; Hence we get an abundance of sensationalism and, when the dust clears,
 &gt; hackers are being compared with bank robbers, mobsters, terrorists,
 &gt; and the like.  It's gotten to the point that the word hacker is almost
 &gt; analogous to the word criminal.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Fortunately, the media is learning. Reporters now approach
 &gt; hackers with a degree of technological savvy. For the most part, they
 &gt; have stopped asking us to commit crimes so they can write a story
 &gt; about it. As the technology envelops us, journalists are developing
 &gt; the same appreciation and curiosity for it that hackers have always
 &gt; had. Any good reporter is at least part hacker because what a hacker
 &gt; does primarily is relentlessly pursue an answer. Computers naturally
 &gt; lend themselves to this sort of pursuit, since they tend to be very
 &gt; patient when asked a lot of questions.
 &gt; 
 &gt; WHAT CONSTITUTES A HI-TECH CRIME?
 &gt; 
 &gt;      So where is the boundary between the hacker world and the
 &gt; criminal world? To me, it has always been in the same place. We know
 &gt; that it's wrong to steal tangible objects. We know that it's wrong to
 &gt; vandalize. We know that it's wrong to invade somebody's privacy. Not
 &gt; one of these elements is part of the hacker world.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      A hacker can certainly turn into a criminal and take advantage of
 &gt; the weaknesses in our telephone and computer systems. But this is
 &gt; rare. What is more likely is that a hacker will share knowledge with
 &gt; people, one of whom will decide to use that knowledge for criminal
 &gt; purposes. This does not make the hacker a criminal for figuring it
 &gt; out. And it certainly doesn't make the criminal into a hacker.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      It is easy to see this when we are talking about crimes that we
 &gt; understand as crimes. But then there are the more nebulous crimes; the
 &gt; ones where we have to ask ourselves: "Is this really a crime?" Copying
 &gt; software is one example. We all know that copying a computer program
 &gt; and then selling it is a crime. It's stealing, plain and simple. But
 &gt; copying a program from a friend to try it out on your home computer --
 &gt; is this the same kind of crime? It seems obvious to me that it is not,
 &gt; the reason being that you must make a leap of logic to turn such an
 &gt; action into a crime. Imagine if we were to charge a licensing fee
 &gt; every time somebody browsed through a magazine at the local bookshop,
 &gt; every time material was borrowed from a library, or every time a phone
 &gt; number was jotted down from the yellow pages. Yet, organizations like
 &gt; the Software Publishers Association have gone on record as saying that
 &gt; it is illegal to use the same computer program on more than one
 &gt; computer in your house. They claim that you must purchase it again or
 &gt; face the threat of federal marshalls kicking in your door. That is a
 &gt; leap of logic.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      It is a leap of logic to assume that because a word processor
 &gt; costs $500, a college student will not try to make a free copy in
 &gt; order to write and become a little more computer literate. Do we
 &gt; punish this student for breaking a rule? Do we charge him with
 &gt; stealing $500? To the hacker culture on whose behalf I am speaking
 &gt; today, the only sensible answer is to make it as easy as possible for
 &gt; that college student to use the software he needs. And while we're at
 &gt; it, we should be happy that he's interested in the first place.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Of course, this represents a fundamental change in our society's
 &gt; outlook. Technology as a way of life, not just another way to make
 &gt; money. After all, we encourage people to read books even if they can't
 &gt; pay for them because to our society literacy is a very important goal.
 &gt; I believe technological literacy is becoming increasingly important.
 &gt; But you cannot have literacy of any kind without having access.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      If we continue to make access to technology difficult,
 &gt; bureaucratic, and illogical, then there will also be more computer
 &gt; crime. The reason being that if you treat someone like a criminal,
 &gt; they will begin to act like one. If we succeed in convincing people
 &gt; that copying a file is the same as physically stealing something, we
 &gt; can hardly be surprised when the broad-based definition results in
 &gt; more overall crime. Blurring the distinction between a virtual
 &gt; infraction and a real-life crime is a mistake.
 &gt; 
 &gt; LEGISLATION FOR COMPUTER AGE CRIME
 &gt; 
 &gt;      New laws are not needed because there is not a single crime that
 &gt; can be committed with a computer that is not already defined as a
 &gt; crime without a computer. But let us not be loose with that
 &gt; definition. Is mere unauthorized access to a computer worthy of
 &gt; federal indictments, lengthy court battles, confiscation of equipment,
 &gt; huge fines, and years of prison time? Or is it closer to a case of
 &gt; trespassing, which in the real world is usually punished by a simple
 &gt; warning? "Of course not," some will say, "since accessing a computer
 &gt; is far more sensitive than walking into an unlocked office building."
 &gt; If that is the case, why is it still so easy to do? If it's possible
 &gt; for somebody to easily gain unauthorized access to a computer that has
 &gt; information about me, I would like to know about it. But somehow I
 &gt; don't think the company or agency running the system would tell me
 &gt; that they have gaping security holes. Hackers, on the other hand, are
 &gt; very open about what they discover which is why large corporations
 &gt; hate them so much. Through legislation, we can turn what the hackers
 &gt; do into a crime and there just might be a slim chance that we can stop
 &gt; them. But that won't fix poorly designed systems whose very existence
 &gt; is a violation of our privacy.
 &gt; 
 &gt; THE DANGERS OF UNINFORMED CONSUMERS
 &gt; 
 &gt;      The concept of privacy is something that is very important to a
 &gt; hacker. This is so because hackers know how fragile privacy is in
 &gt; today's world. Wherever possible we encourage people to protect their
 &gt; directories, encrypt their electronic mail, not use cellular phones,
 &gt; and whatever else it takes to keep their lives to themselves. In 1984
 &gt; hackers were instrumental in showing the world how TRW kept credit
 &gt; files on millions of Americans. Most people had never even heard of a
 &gt; credit file until this happened.  Passwords were very poorly guarded -
 &gt; in fact, credit reports had the password printed on the credit report
 &gt; itself. More recently, hackers found that MCI's Friends and Family
 &gt; program allowed anybody to call an 800 number and find out the numbers
 &gt; of everyone in a customer's "calling circle". As a bonus, you could
 &gt; also find out how these numbers were related to the customer:  friend,
 &gt; brother, daughter-in-law, business partner, etc. Many times these
 &gt; numbers were unlisted yet all that was needed to "verify" the
 &gt; customer's identity was the correct zip code. In both the TRW and MCI
 &gt; cases, hackers were ironically accused of being the ones to invade
 &gt; privacy. What they really did was help to educate the American
 &gt; consumer.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Nowhere is this more apparent than in the telephone industry.
 &gt; Throughout the country, telephone companies take advantage of
 &gt; consumers. They do this primarily because the consumer does not
 &gt; understand the technology. When we don't understand something
 &gt; complicated, we tend to believe those who do understand. The same is
 &gt; true for auto mechanics, plumbers, doctors, and lawyers. They all
 &gt; speak some strange language that the majority of us will never
 &gt; understand. So we tend to believe them. The difference with the phone
 &gt; companies, and here I am referring to the local companies, is that you
 &gt; cannot deal with somebody else if you happen to disagree with them or
 &gt; find them untrustworthy. The phone companies have us in a situation
 &gt; where we must believe what they say. If we don't believe them, we
 &gt; cannot go elsewhere.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      This is the frustration that the hacker community constantly
 &gt; faces. We face it especially because we are able to understand when
 &gt; the local phone companies take advantage of consumers. Here are a few
 &gt; examples:
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Charging a fee for touch tone service. This is a misnomer.  It
 &gt; actually takes extra effort to tell the computer to ignore the tones
 &gt; that you produce. Everybody already has touch tone capability but we
 &gt; are forced to pay the phone company not to block it. While $1.50 a
 &gt; month may not seem like much, when added together the local companies
 &gt; that still engage in this practice are making millions of dollars a
 &gt; year for absolutely nothing. Why do they get away with it? Because too
 &gt; many of us don't understand how the phone system works. I try to draw
 &gt; an analogy in this particular case - imagine if the phone company
 &gt; decided that a fee would be charged to those customers who wanted to
 &gt; use the number five when dialing. They could argue that the five takes
 &gt; more energy than the four but most of us would see through this flimsy
 &gt; logic. We must seek out other such dubious practices and not blindly
 &gt; accept what we are told.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Other examples abound: being charged extra not to have your name
 &gt; listed in the telephone directory, a monthly maintenance charge if you
 &gt; select your own telephone number, the fact that calling information to
 &gt; get a number now costs more than calling the number itself.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      More recently, we have become acquainted with a new standard
 &gt; called Signalling System Seven or SS7. Through this system it is
 &gt; possible for telephones to have all kinds of new features: Caller ID,
 &gt; Return Call, Repeat Calling to get through a busy signal, and more.
 &gt; But again, we are having the wool pulled over our eyes. For instance,
 &gt; if you take advantage of Call Return in New York (which will call the
 &gt; last person who dialed your number), you are charged 75 cents on top
 &gt; of the cost of the call itself.  Obviously, there is a cost involved
 &gt; when new technologies are introduced. But there is no additional
 &gt; equipment, manpower, or time consumed when you dial *69 to return a
 &gt; call. It's a permanent part of the system. As a comparison, we could
 &gt; say that it also costs money to install a hold button. Imagine how we
 &gt; would feel if we were charged a fee every time we used it.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      The local companies are not the only offenders but it is
 &gt; particularly bad in their case because, for the vast majority of
 &gt; Americans, there is no competition on this level. The same complaints
 &gt; are being voiced concerning cable television companies.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Long distance telephone companies are also guilty. AT&amp;T, MCI, and
 &gt; Sprint all encourage the use of calling cards. Yet each imposes a
 &gt; formidable surcharge each and every time they're used.  AT&amp;T, for
 &gt; example, charges 13 cents for the first minute of a nighttime call
 &gt; from Washington DC to New York plus an 80 cent surcharge. Since a
 &gt; calling card can only be used to make telephone calls, why are
 &gt; consumers expected to pay an extra fee as if they were doing something
 &gt; above and beyond the normal capability of the card? Again, there is no
 &gt; extra work necessary to complete a calling card call - at least not on
 &gt; the phone company's part. The consumer, on the other hand, must enter
 &gt; up to 25 additional digits. But billing is accomplished merely by
 &gt; computers sending data to each other. Gone are the days of tickets
 &gt; being written up by hand and verified by human beings.  Everything is
 &gt; accomplished quickly, efficiently, and cheaply by computer. Therefore,
 &gt; these extra charges are outdated.
 &gt; 
 &gt; SOCIAL INJUSTICES OF TECHNOLOGY
 &gt; 
 &gt;      The way in which we have allowed public telephones to be operated
 &gt; is particularly unfair to those who are economically disadvantaged. A
 &gt; one minute call to Washington DC can cost as little as 12 cents from
 &gt; the comfort of your own home. However, if you don't happen to have a
 &gt; phone, or if you don't happen to have a home, that same one minute
 &gt; call will cost you $2.20. That figure is the cheapest rate there is
 &gt; from a Bell operated payphone. With whatever kind of logic was used to
 &gt; set these prices, the results are clear. We have made it harder and
 &gt; more expensive for the poor among us to gain access to the telephone
 &gt; network. Surely this is not something we can be proud of.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      A direct result of this inequity is the prevalence of red boxes.
 &gt; Red boxes are nothing more than tone generators that transmit a quick
 &gt; burst of five tones which convince the central office that a quarter
 &gt; has been deposited. It's very easy and almost totally undetectable.
 &gt; It's also been going on for decades.  Neither the local nor long
 &gt; distance companies have expended much effort towards stopping red
 &gt; boxes, which gives the impression that the payphone profits are still
 &gt; lucrative, even with this abuse. But even more troubling is the
 &gt; message this is sending.  Think of it. For a poor and homeless person
 &gt; to gain access to something that would cost the rest of us 12 cents,
 &gt; they must commit a crime and steal $2.20. This is not equal access.
 &gt; 
 &gt; CORPORATE RULES
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Hackers and phone phreaks, as some of us are called, are very
 &gt; aware of these facts. We learn by asking lots of questions.  We learn
 &gt; by going to libraries and doing research. We learn by diving into
 &gt; phone company trash dumpsters, reading discarded material, and doing
 &gt; more research. But who will listen to people like us who have been
 &gt; frequently characterized as criminals? I am particularly grateful that
 &gt; this committee has chosen to hear us.  What is very important to us is
 &gt; open communications. Freedom of information. An educated public.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      This puts us at direct odds with many organizations, who believe
 &gt; that everything they do is "proprietary" and that the public has no
 &gt; right to know how the public networks work. In July of 1992 we were
 &gt; threatened with legal action by Bellcore (the research arm of the
 &gt; Regional Bell Operating Companies) for revealing security weaknesses
 &gt; inherent in Busy Line Verification (BLV) trunks. The information had
 &gt; been leaked to us and we did not feel compelled to join Bellcore's
 &gt; conspiracy of silence. In April of this year, we were threatened with
 &gt; legal action by AT&amp;T for printing proprietary information of theirs.
 &gt; The information in question was a partial list of the addresses of
 &gt; AT&amp;T offices.  It's very hard for us to imagine how such information
 &gt; could be considered secret. But these actions are not surprising. They
 &gt; only serve to illustrate the wide disparities between the corporate
 &gt; mindset and that of the individual. It is essential that the hundreds
 &gt; of millions of Americans who will be affected by today's
 &gt; all-encompassing inventions not be forced to play by corporate rules.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      In 1990 a magazine similar to 2600 was closed down by the United
 &gt; States government because Bell South said they printed proprietary
 &gt; information. Most people never found out about this because Phrack
 &gt; Magazine was electronic, i.e., only available on computer bulletin
 &gt; boards and networks. This in itself is wrong; a publication must have
 &gt; the same First Amendment rights regardless of whether it is printed
 &gt; electronically or on paper. As more online journals appear, this basic
 &gt; tenet will become increasingly critical to our nation's future as a
 &gt; democracy. Apart from this matter, we must look at what Bell South
 &gt; claimed - that a document discussing the Enhanced 911 system which was
 &gt; worth $79,449 had been "stolen" and printed by Phrack. (Some newspaper
 &gt; accounts even managed to change it into an E911 program which gave the
 &gt; appearance that hackers were actually interfering with the operation
 &gt; of an E911 system and putting lives at risk. In reality there has
 &gt; never been a report of a hacker gaining access to such a system.) It
 &gt; was not until after the publisher of Phrack was forced to go to trial
 &gt; that the real value of the document was revealed. Anyone could get a
 &gt; copy for around $14. The government promptly dropped its case against
 &gt; the publisher who, to this day, is still paying back $100,000 in legal
 &gt; fees. As further evidence of the inquity between individual justice
 &gt; and corporate justice, Bell South was never charged with fraud for its
 &gt; claim that a $14 document was worth nearly $80,000. Their logic, as
 &gt; explained in a memo to then Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Cook, was
 &gt; that the full salaries of everyone who helped write the document, as
 &gt; well as the full cost of all hardware and software used in the
 &gt; endeavor ($31,000 for a Vaxstation II, $6,000 for a printer), was
 &gt; perfectly acceptable. It is very disturbing that the United States
 &gt; government agreed with this assessment and moved to put a pre-law
 &gt; student behind bars for violating corporate rules.
 &gt; 
 &gt; MISGUIDED AUTHORITY
 &gt; 
 &gt;      I wish I could stand before this committee and say that we have
 &gt; been successful in stopping all such miscarriages of justice. While
 &gt; the Phrack case may have been the most bizarre, there are many more
 &gt; instances of individuals being victimized in similar manners. A
 &gt; teenager in Chicago was jailed for a year for copying a file that was
 &gt; worth millions, according to AT&amp;T, but was utterly worthless and
 &gt; unusable to a kid. A bulletin board operator in California, along with
 &gt; his entire family, was held at gunpoint for hours while authorities
 &gt; seized his equipment in an unsuccessful attempt to find child
 &gt; pornography. Three hackers in Atlanta, after being imprisoned up to a
 &gt; year for dialing into a Bell South computer system that had no
 &gt; password, were forced to pay $233,000 in restitution so the company
 &gt; could install a password system. More recently, a student at the
 &gt; University of Texas at Houston was suspended from school for a year
 &gt; because he accessed a file that merely listed the users of the system
 &gt; (a file which the system allows all users to access). In increasing
 &gt; numbers, young people are being sent to jail, not necessarily for
 &gt; something they did, but rather for something they could have done in a
 &gt; worst-case scenario. Again this indicates fear and misunderstanding of
 &gt; technology and its applications. But this time those feelings emanate
 &gt; from those in authority.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Locally, an ominous happening occurred at a 2600 monthly meeting
 &gt; last November. (These meetings occur in public areas in cities
 &gt; throughout the nation on the first Friday of every month.) Shortly
 &gt; after it began, the Washington meeting was broken up by Pentagon City
 &gt; Mall security guards. Without any provocation, people were forced to
 &gt; submit to searches and everybody's name was taken down. One of the
 &gt; attendees who was writing down an officer's name had the paper ripped
 &gt; from his hand, another had his film taken from his camera as he tried
 &gt; to document what was going on. Upon questioning by a reporter from
 &gt; Communications Daily, the mall security chief claimed that he was
 &gt; acting under orders from the United States Secret Service. Subsequent
 &gt; Freedom of Information Act requests by Computer Professionals for
 &gt; Social Responsibility have yielded more evidence implicating the
 &gt; Secret Service in this illegal and unwarranted action. Nothing of a
 &gt; criminal nature was ever found in any of the bags that were searched.
 &gt; But a full list of the attendees wound up in the possession of the
 &gt; Secret Service. It seems ironic that while hackers are conducting an
 &gt; open gathering in the middle of a shopping mall in order to share
 &gt; knowledge and welcome new people, agents of the Secret Service are
 &gt; lurking in the shadows trying to figure out ways to stop them.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      How can we move forward and talk about exciting new applications
 &gt; of technology when we're off to such a bad start?  The people that are
 &gt; being arrested, harassed, and intimidated are the people who will be
 &gt; designing and running these new systems. They are the ones who will
 &gt; appreciate their capabilities and understand their weaknesses. Through
 &gt; our short-sightedness and eagerness to listen to the loudest voices,
 &gt; we are alienating the promises of the future. How many here, who grew
 &gt; up in decades past, remember hearing teenagers talk of how the
 &gt; government is after them, watching their every move, listening to
 &gt; their phone calls, doing everything one might expect in a totalitarian
 &gt; regime. Such feelings are the sure sign of an ailing society. It does
 &gt; not matter if these things are not actually occurring - their mere
 &gt; perception is enough to cause lasting harm and mistrust.
 &gt; 
 &gt; PROMISE OF THE INTERNET
 &gt; 
 &gt;      The future holds such enormous potential. It is vital that we not
 &gt; succumb to our fears and allow our democratic ideals and privacy
 &gt; values to be shattered. In many ways, the world of cyberspace is more
 &gt; real than the real world itself. I say this because it is only within
 &gt; the virtual world that people are really free to be themselves - to
 &gt; speak without fear of reprisal, to be anonymous if they so choose, to
 &gt; participate in a dialogue where one is judged by the merits of their
 &gt; words, not the color of their skin or the timbre of their voice.
 &gt; Contrast this to our existing "real" world where we often have people
 &gt; sized up before they even utter a word. The Internet has evolved, on
 &gt; its own volition, to become a true bastion of worldwide democracy. It
 &gt; is the obligation of this committee, and of governments throughout the
 &gt; world, not to stand in its way.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      This does not mean we should stand back and do nothing.  Quite
 &gt; the contrary, there is much we have to do if accessibility and
 &gt; equality are our goals. Over-regulation and commercialization are two
 &gt; ways to quickly kill these goals. A way to realize them is to have a
 &gt; network access point in every house. Currently, network access is
 &gt; restricted to students or professors at participating schools,
 &gt; scientists, commercial establishments, and those who have access to,
 &gt; and can afford, local services that link into the Internet. Yes, a lot
 &gt; of people have access today.  But a far greater number do not and it
 &gt; is to these people that we must speak. The bigger the Internet gets,
 &gt; the better it gets. As it exists today, cultures from around the globe
 &gt; are represented; information of all kinds is exchanged. People are
 &gt; writing, reading, thinking. It's potentially the greatest educational
 &gt; tool we have. Therefore, it is essential that we not allow it to
 &gt; become a commodity that only certain people in society will be able to
 &gt; afford. With today's technology, we face the danger of widening the
 &gt; gap between the haves and the have-nots to a monumental level. Or we
 &gt; can open the door and discover that people really do have a lot to
 &gt; learn from each other, given the opportunity.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      It is my hope that this committee will recognize the importance
 &gt; of dialogue with the American public, in order to answer the questions
 &gt; so many are asking and to address the concerns that have been
 &gt; overlooked. I thank you for this opportunity to express those issues
 &gt; that I feel relevant to this hearing.

 &gt; Subject: File 2--CPSR Clipper Testimony (6-9-93) in House Subcommittee
 &gt; 
 &gt;   CPSR Clipper Testimony 6/9
 &gt; 
 &gt;         On June 9, 1993, Congressman Edward Markey, Chairman of the
 &gt; House  Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance held an
 &gt; oversight hearing on Rencryption and telecommunications network
 &gt; security. Panelists were Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, Dr.
 &gt; Dorothy Denning,  Steven Bryen of Secure Communications, Marc
 &gt; Rotenberg of the CPSR Washington Office and E.R. Kerkeslager of AT&amp;T.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         Congressman Markey, after hearing the testimony presented,
 &gt; noted that the Clipper proposal had raised an arched eyebrow among
 &gt; the whole committeeS and that the committee viewed the proposal
 &gt; skeptically. This statement was the latest indication that the Clipper
 &gt; proposal has not been well received by policy makers.  Last Friday,
 &gt; the Computer Systems Security and Privacy Advisory Board of NIST
 &gt; issued two resolutions critical of the encryption plan, suggesting
 &gt; that further study was required and that implementation of the plan
 &gt; should be delayed until the review is completed.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         At the Third CPSR Cryptography and Privacy Conference on
 &gt; Monday, June 7, the Acting Director of NIST, Raymond Kammer, announced
 &gt; that the implementation of the proposal will be delayed and that a
 &gt; more comprehensive review will be undertaken.  The review is due in
 &gt; the fall.  Kammer told the Washington Post that Rmaybe we wonUt
 &gt; continue in the direction we started ous.

 &gt;                                June 9, 1993
 &gt; 
 &gt; SUMMARY
 &gt; 
 &gt;         The cryptography issue is of particular concern to CPSR.
 &gt; During the past several years CPSR has pursued an extensive study of
 &gt; cryptography policy in the United States.  CPSR has organized public
 &gt; conferences, conducted litigation under the Freedom of Information Act,
 &gt; and has emphasized the importance of cryptography for privacy
 &gt; protection and the need to scrutinize carefully government proposals
 &gt; designed to limit the use of this technology.
 &gt;         To evaluate the Clipper proposal it is necessary to look at a
 &gt; 1987 law, the Computer Security Act, which made clear that in the area
 &gt; of unclassified computing systems, the National Institute of Standards
 &gt; and Technology (NIST) and not the National Security Agency (NSA), would
 &gt; be responsible for the development of technical standards.  The Act
 &gt; emphasized public accountability and stressed open decision-making.
 &gt;         In the spirit of the Act, in 1989 NIST set out to develop a
 &gt; public key cryptography standard.  According to documents obtained by
 &gt; CPSR through the Freedom of Information Act, NIST recommended that the
 &gt; algorithm be "public, unclassified, implementable in both hardware or
 &gt; software, usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national
 &gt; corporation." However, the Clipper proposal and the full-blown Capstone
 &gt; configuration that resulted is very different: the Clipper algorithm,
 &gt; Skipjack, is classified; public access to the reasons underlying the
 &gt; proposal is restricted; Skipjack can be implemented only in
 &gt; tamper-proof hardware; it is unlikely to be used by multi-national
 &gt; corporations, and the security of Clipper remains unproven.
 &gt;         The Clipper proposal undermines the central purpose of the
 &gt; Computer Security Act.  Although intended for broad use in commercial
 &gt; networks, it was not developed at the request of either U.S. business
 &gt; or the general public.  It does not reflect public goals.
 &gt;         The premise of the Clipper key escrow arrangement is that the
 &gt; government must have the ability to intercept electronic
 &gt; communications.  However, there is no legal basis to support this
 &gt; premise. In law there is nothing inherently illegal or suspect about
 &gt; the use of a telephone.  The federal wiretap statute says only that
 &gt; communication service providers must assist law enforcement execute a
 &gt; lawful warrant.
 &gt;         CPSR supports the review of cryptography policy currently
 &gt; underway at the Department of Commerce.  CPSR also supports the efforts
 &gt; undertaken by the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance to
 &gt; study the full ramifications of the Clipper proposal.  However, we are
 &gt; not pleased about the review now being undertaken at the White House.
 &gt; That effort has led to a series of secret meetings, has asked that
 &gt; scientists sign non-disclosure agreements and accept restrictions on
 &gt; publication, and has attempted to resolve public concerns through
 &gt; private channels.  This is not a good process for the evaluation of a
 &gt; technology that is proposed for the public switched network.
 &gt;         Even if the issues regarding Clipper are resolved favorably,
 &gt; privacy concerns will not go away. Rules still need to be developed
 &gt; about the collection and use of transactional data generated by
 &gt; computer communications.  Several specific steps should be taken.
 &gt; First, the FCC should be given a broad mandate to pursue privacy
 &gt; concerns.  Second, current gaps in the communications law should be
 &gt; filled.  The protection of transactional records is particularly
 &gt; important.  Third, telecommunications companies should be encouraged to
 &gt; explore innovative ways to protect privacy.  "Telephone cards", widely
 &gt; available in other countries, are an ideal way to protect privacy.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; TESTIMONY
 &gt; 
 &gt;         Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the
 &gt; opportunity to testify today on encryption policy and the Clipper
 &gt; proposal.  I especially wish to thank you Congressman Markey, on behalf
 &gt; of CPSR, for your ongoing efforts on the privacy front as well as your
 &gt; work to promote public access to electronic information.
 &gt;         The cryptography issue is of particular concern to CPSR.
 &gt; During the past several years we have pursued an extensive study of
 &gt; cryptography policy in the United States.  We have organized several
 &gt; public conferences, conducted litigation under the Freedom of
 &gt; Information Act, and appeared on a number of panels to discuss the
 &gt; importance of cryptography for privacy protection and the need to
 &gt; scrutinize carefully government proposals designed to limit the use of
 &gt; this technology.
 &gt;         While we do not represent any particular computer company or
 &gt; trade association we do speak for a great many people in the computer
 &gt; profession who value privacy and are concerned about the government's
 &gt; Clipper initiative.
 &gt;         Today I will briefly summarize our assessment of the Clipper
 &gt; proposal.  Then I would like to say a few words about the current
 &gt; status of privacy protection.
 &gt; 
 &gt; CLIPPER
 &gt;         To put the Clipper proposal in a policy context, I will need to
 &gt; briefly to describe a law passed in 1987 intended to address the roles
 &gt; of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense in the
 &gt; development of technical standards.  The Computer Security Act of 1987
 &gt; was enacted to improve computer security in the federal government, to
 &gt; clarify the responsibilities of the National Institute of Standards and
 &gt; Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency, and to ensure that
 &gt; technical standards would serve civilian and commercial needs.
 &gt;         The law made clear that in the area of unclassified computing
 &gt; systems, NIST and not NSA, would be responsible for the development of
 &gt; technical standards.  It emphasized public accountability and stressed
 &gt; open decision-making.  The Computer Security Act also established the
 &gt; Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB), charged
 &gt; with reviewing the activities of NIST and ensuring that the mandate of
 &gt; the law was enforced.
 &gt;         The Computer Security Act grew out of a concern that classified
 &gt; standards and secret meetings would not serve the interests of the
 &gt; general public.  As the practical applications for cryptography have
 &gt; moved from the military and intelligence arenas to the commercial
 &gt; sphere, this point has become clear.  There is also clearly a conflict
 &gt; of interest when an agency tasked with signal interception is also
 &gt; given authority to develop standards for network security.
 &gt;         In the spirit of the Computer Security Act, NIST set out in
 &gt; 1989 to develop a public key standard FIPS (Federal Information
 &gt; Processing Standard).  In a memo dated May 5, 1989, obtained by CPSR
 &gt; through the Freedom of Information Act, NIST said that it planned:
 &gt; 
 &gt; to develop the necessary public-key based security standards.  We
 &gt; require a public-key algorithm for calculating digital signatures and
 &gt; we also require a public-key algorithm for distributing secret keys.
 &gt; 
 &gt; NIST then went on to define the requirements of the standard:
 &gt; 
 &gt; The algorithms that we use must be public, unclassified, implementable
 &gt; in both hardware or software, usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based
 &gt; multi-national corporation, and must provide a level of security
 &gt; sufficient for the protection of unclassified, sensitive information
 &gt; and commercial propriety and/or valuable information.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         The Clipper proposal and the full-blown Capstone configuration,
 &gt; which incorporates the key management function NIST set out to develop
 &gt; in 1989, is very different from the one originally conceived by NIST.
 &gt; 
 &gt; %       The Clipper algorithm, Skipjack, is classified,
 &gt; %       Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is
 &gt; restricted,
 &gt; %       Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof hardware,
 &gt; %       It is Unlikely to be used by multi-national corporations, and
 &gt; %       The security of Clipper remains unproven.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         The Clipper proposal undermines the central purpose of the
 &gt; Computer Security Act.  Although intended for broad use in commercial
 &gt; networks, it was not developed at the request of either U.S. business
 &gt; or the general public.  It does not reflect public goals.  Rather it
 &gt; reflects the interests of one secret agency with the authority to
 &gt; conduct foreign signal intelligence and another government agency
 &gt; responsible for law enforcement investigations.
 &gt;         Documents obtained by CPSR through the Freedom of Information
 &gt; Act indicate that the National Security Agency dominated the meetings
 &gt; of the joint NIST/NSA Technical Working group which made
 &gt; recommendations to NIST regarding public key cryptography, and that a
 &gt; related technical standard for message authentication, the Digital
 &gt; Signature Standard, clearly reflected the interests of the NSA.
 &gt;         We are still trying to determine the precise role of the NSA in
 &gt; the development of the Clipper proposal.  We would be pleased to
 &gt; provide to the Subcommittee whatever materials we obtain.
 &gt; 
 &gt; LEGAL AND POLICY ISSUES
 &gt;         There are also several legal and constitutional issues raised
 &gt; by the government's key escrow proposal.  The premise of the Clipper
 &gt; key escrow arrangement is that the government must have the ability to
 &gt; intercept electronic communications, regardless of the economic or
 &gt; societal costs.  The FBI's Digital Telephony proposal, and the earlier
 &gt; Senate bill 266, were based on the same assumption.
 &gt;         There are a number of arguments made in defense of this
 &gt; position: that privacy rights and law enforcement needs must be
 &gt; balanced, or that the government will be unable to conduct criminal
 &gt; investigations without this capability.
 &gt;         Regardless of how one views these various claims, there is one
 &gt; point about the law that should be made very clear: currently there is
 &gt; no legal basis -- in statute, the Constitution or anywhere else --
 &gt; that supports the premise which underlies the Clipper proposal.  As the
 &gt; law currently stands, surveillance is not a design goal.  General
 &gt; Motors would have a stronger legal basis for building cars that could
 &gt; go no faster than 65 miles per hour than AT&amp;T does in marketing a
 &gt; commercial telephone that has a built-in wiretap capability.  In law
 &gt; there is simply nothing about the use of a telephone that is inherently
 &gt; illegal or suspect.
 &gt;         The federal wiretap statute says only that communication
 &gt; service providers must assist law enforcement in the execution of a
 &gt; lawful warrant.  It does not say that anyone is obligated to design
 &gt; systems to facilitate future wire surveillance.  That distinction is
 &gt; the difference between countries that restrict wire surveillance to
 &gt; narrow circumstances defined in law and those that treat all users of
 &gt; the telephone network as potential criminals.  U.S. law takes the first
 &gt; approach.  Countries such as the former East Germany took the second
 &gt; approach.  The use of the phone system by citizens was considered
 &gt; inherently suspect and for that reason more than 10,000 people were
 &gt; employed by the East German government to listen in on telephone calls.
 &gt;         It is precisely because the wiretap statute does not contain
 &gt; the obligation to incorporate surveillance capability -- the design
 &gt; premise of the Clipper proposal -- that the Federal Bureau of
 &gt; Investigation introduced the Digital Telephony legislation.  But that
 &gt; legislation has not moved forward and the law has remained unchanged.
 &gt; The Clipper proposal attempts to accomplish through the
 &gt; standard-setting and procurement process what the Congress has been
 &gt; unwilling to do through the legislative process.
 &gt;         On legal grounds, adopting the Clipper would be a mistake.
 &gt; There is an important policy goal underlying the wiretap law.  The
 &gt; Fourth Amendment and the federal wiretap statute do not so much balance
 &gt; competing interests as they erect barriers against government excess
 &gt; and define the proper scope of criminal investigation.  The purpose of
 &gt; the federal wiretap law is to restrict the government, it is not to
 &gt; coerce the public.
 &gt;         Therefore, if the government endorses the Clipper proposal, it
 &gt; will undermine the basic philosophy of the federal wiretap law and the
 &gt; fundamental values embodied in the Constitution.  It will establish a
 &gt; technical mechanism for signal interception based on a premise that has
 &gt; no legal foundation.  The assumption underlying the Clipper proposal is
 &gt; more compatible with the practice of telephone surveillance in the
 &gt; former East Germany than it is with the narrowly limited circumstances
 &gt; that wire surveillance has been allowed in the United States.
 &gt; 
 &gt; UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
 &gt;         There are a number of other legal issues that have not been
 &gt; adequately considered by the proponents of the key escrow arrangement
 &gt; that the Subcommittee should examine.  First, not all lawful wiretaps
 &gt; follow a normal warrant process.  The proponents of Clipper should make
 &gt; clear how emergency wiretaps will be conducted before the proposal goes
 &gt; forward.  Second, there may be civil liability issues for the escrow
 &gt; agents, if they are private parties, if there is abuse or compromise of
 &gt; the keys.  Third, there is a Fifth Amendment dimension to the proposed
 &gt; escrow key arrangement if a network user is compelled to disclose his
 &gt; or her key to the government in order to access a communications
 &gt; network. Each one of these issues should be examined carefully.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; CPSR CONFERENCE
 &gt;         At a conference organized by CPSR this week at the Carnegie
 &gt; Endowment for International Peace we heard presentations from staff
 &gt; members at NIST, FBI, NSA and the White House about the Clipper
 &gt; proposal.  The participants at the meeting had the opportunity to ask
 &gt; questions and to exchange views.
 &gt;         Certain points now seem clear:
 &gt; 
 &gt; %       The Clipper proposal was not developed in response to any
 &gt; perceived public or business need.  It was developed solely to address
 &gt; a law enforcement concern.
 &gt; %       Wire surveillance remains a small part of law enforcement
 &gt; investigations.  The number of arrests resulting from wiretaps has
 &gt; remained essentially unchanged since the federal wiretap law was enacted
 &gt; in 1968.
 &gt; %       The potential risks of the Clipper proposal have not been
 &gt; assessed and many questions about the implementation remain unanswered.
 &gt; %       Clipper does not appear to have the support of the business or
 &gt; research community.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         Many comments on the Clipper proposal, both positive and
 &gt; negative as well the materials obtained by CPSR through the Freedom of
 &gt; Information Act, are contained in the Source book compiled by CPSR for
 &gt; the recent conference.  I am please to make a copy of this available to
 &gt; the Subcommittee.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; NETWORK PRIVACY PROTECTION
 &gt;         Communications privacy remains a critical test for network
 &gt; development.  Networks that do not provide a high degree of privacy are
 &gt; clearly less useful to network users.  Given the choice between a
 &gt; cryptography product without a key escrow and one with a key escrow, it
 &gt; would be difficult to find a user who would prefer the key escrow
 &gt; requirement.  If this proposal does go forward, it will not be because
 &gt; network users or commercial service providers favored it.
 &gt;         Even if the issues regarding the Clipper are resolved
 &gt; favorably, privacy concerns will not go away.  Cryptography is a part
 &gt; of communications privacy, but it is only a small part.  Rules still
 &gt; need to be developed about the collection and use of transactional data
 &gt; generated by computer communications.  While the federal wiretap law
 &gt; generally does a very good job of protecting the content of
 &gt; communications against interception by government agencies, large holes
 &gt; still remain.  The extensive use of subpoenas by the government to
 &gt; obtain toll records and the sale of telephone records by private
 &gt; companies are just two examples of gaps in current law.
 &gt;         The enforcement of privacy laws is also a particularly serious
 &gt; concern in the United States.  Good laws without clear mechanisms for
 &gt; enforcement raise over-arching questions about the adequacy of legal
 &gt; protections in this country.  This problem is known to those who have
 &gt; followed developments with the Privacy Act since passage in 1974 and
 &gt; the more recent Video Privacy and Protection Act of 1988.  I make this
 &gt; point because it has been the experience in other countries that
 &gt; agencies charged with the responsibility for privacy protection can be
 &gt; effective advocates for the public in the protection of personal
 &gt; privacy.
 &gt; 
 &gt; RECOMMENDATIONS
 &gt;         Regarding the Clipper proposal, we believe that the national
 &gt; review currently underway by the Computer Security and Privacy Advisory
 &gt; Board at the Department of Commerce will be extremely useful and we
 &gt; look forward to the results of that effort.  The Panel has already
 &gt; conducted a series of important open hearings and compiled useful
 &gt; materials on Clipper and cryptography policy for public review.
 &gt;         We are also pleased that the Subcommittee on Telecommunications
 &gt; and Finance has undertaken this hearing.  This Subcommittee can play a
 &gt; particularly important role in the resolution of these issues.  We also
 &gt; appreciate the Chairman's efforts to ensure that the proper studies are
 &gt; undertaken, that the General Accounting Office fully explores these
 &gt; issues, and that the Secretary of Commerce carefully assesses the
 &gt; potential impact of the Clipper proposal on export policy.
 &gt;         We are, however, less pleased about the White House study
 &gt; currently underway.  That effort, organized in large part by the
 &gt; National Security Council, has led to a series of secret meetings, has
 &gt; asked that scientists sign non-disclosure agreements and accept
 &gt; restrictions on publication, and has attempted to resolve public
 &gt; concerns through private channels.  This is not a good process for the
 &gt; evaluation of a technology that is proposed for the public switched
 &gt; network.  While we acknowledge that the White House has been reasonably
 &gt; forthcoming in explaining the current state of affairs, we do not think
 &gt; that this process is a good one.
 &gt;         For these reasons, we believe that the White House should
 &gt; properly defer to the recommendations of the Computer System Security
 &gt; and Privacy Advisory Board and the Subcommittee on Telecommunications
 &gt; and Finance.  We hope that no further steps in support of the Clipper
 &gt; initiative will be taken.  We specifically recommend that no further
 &gt; purchase of Clipper chips be approved.
 &gt;         Speaking more generally, we believe that a number of steps
 &gt; could be taken to ensure that future communications initiatives could
 &gt; properly be viewed as a boost to privacy and not a set-back.
 &gt; 
 &gt; %       The FCC must be given a strong mandate to pursue privacy
 &gt; concerns.  There should be an office specifically established to
 &gt; examine privacy issues and to prepare reports.  Similar efforts in
 &gt; other countries have been enormously successful.  The Japanese Ministry
 &gt; of Post and Telecommunications developed a set of privacy principles to
 &gt; ensure continued trade with Europe.  The Canada Ministry of
 &gt; Communications developed a set of communications principles to address
 &gt; public concerns about the privacy of cellular communications.  In
 &gt; Europe, the EC put forward an important directive on privacy protection
 &gt; for the development of new network services.
 &gt; 
 &gt; %       Current gaps in the communications law should be filled.  The
 &gt; protection of transactional records is particularly important.
 &gt; Legislation is needed to limit law enforcement access to toll record
 &gt; information and to restrict the sale of data generated by the use of
 &gt; telecommunication services.  As the network becomes digital, the
 &gt; transaction records associated with a particular communication may
 &gt; become more valuable than the content of the communication itself.
 &gt; 
 &gt; %       Telecommunications companies should be encouraged to explore
 &gt; innovative ways to protect privacy.  Cryptography is a particular
 &gt; method to seal electronic communications, but far more important for
 &gt; routine communications could be anonymous telephone cards, similar to
 &gt; the metro cards here in the District of Columbia, that allow consumers
 &gt; to purchase services without establishing accounts, transferring
 &gt; personal data, or recording personal activities.  Such cards are widely
 &gt; available in Europe, Japan, and Australia.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         I thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before the
 &gt; Subcommittee and would be pleased to answer your questions Computer
 &gt; Professionals for Social Responsibility
 &gt; 
 &gt;         CPSR is a national membership organization, established in
 &gt; 1982, to address the social impact of computer technology.  There are
 &gt; 2,500 members in 20 chapters across the United States, and offices in
 &gt; Palo Alto, California, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Washington DC. The
 &gt; organization is governed by a board of elected officers and meetings
 &gt; are open to the public.  CPSR sponsors an annual meeting and the
 &gt; biennial conference on Directions and Implications of Advanced
 &gt; Computing.  CPSR sponsored the first conference on Computers, Freedom,
 &gt; and Privacy in 1991.  CPSR also operates the Internet Library at
 &gt; cpsr.org.  The library contains documents from the White House on
 &gt; technology policy and a wide range of public laws covering privacy,
 &gt; access to information, and communications law and is available free of
 &gt; charge to all users of the Internet.
 &gt; 
 &gt;         Marc Rotenberg is the director of the CPSR Washington office
 &gt; and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.  He is
 &gt; chairman of the ACM Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights,
 &gt; an editor for the Computer Law and Security Report (London), and the
 &gt; secretary of Privacy International, an organization of human rights
 &gt; advocates and privacy scholars in forty countries.  He received an A.B.
 &gt; from Harvard College and a J.D. from Stanford Law School, and is a
 &gt; member of the bar of the United States Supreme Court.  His forthcoming
 &gt; article "Communications Privacy: Implications for Network Design" will
 &gt; appear in the August 1993 issue of Communications o0f the ACM.
