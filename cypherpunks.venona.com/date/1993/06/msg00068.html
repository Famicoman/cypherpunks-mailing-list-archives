&gt; Subject: Software infrastructure

...other good stuff deleted...I read mail at 2400B.

&gt; The result would be that when you receive an encrypted message, you
&gt; just list it out to your terminal and then, automatically, PGP fires up
&gt; and asks you for your pass phrase (unless you SET it ahead of time in
&gt; the PC's environment).  It then displays the message for you.
&gt; 
&gt; This simple model has several deficiencies.  When I log into a Unix system,
&gt; or Compuserve, or Portal's "Online" service, and read my mail, it is often
&gt; shown to me a page at a time.  This is so that I can read long messages
&gt; more easily.  Then after each message I can delete it, save it, reply to
&gt; it, etc.  If I do reply or if I want to create a new message it will drop
&gt; me into a text editor to compose the message.
&gt; 
&gt; The result is that the mail program you are running on the host computer
&gt; may do some munging on the PGP message, like inserting "Press RETURN for
&gt; next page" or perhaps some terminal control characters.  These would have
&gt; to be filtered out before PGP could run on the file, or you would have to
&gt; be able to suppress them when you read this message.

If we are talking about an off-line reader, this is solved by a trivial filter
routine.  If you want to do this on-line, well it might take time.

&gt; Also, assuming we could capture the message and run PGP on it automatically,
&gt; the resulting decrypted message will have to be saved and given a file
&gt; name.  Then if the user wants to reply to it he is going to have to leave
&gt; his terminal and run an editor.  (At least, that's what I have to do now.)

Why save the plaintext?  I keep it in cyphertext and decrypt it on demand.  And
when I want to reply, then I decrypt it, quote it and have the user edit that 
file, which will presumably be re-encrypted.

&gt; Plus, this only deals with the message-receiving problem, not the sending
&gt; problem.

Actually, these are the same problems in different clothes.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what the solution is.  Maybe the PC program needs to be more
&gt; than a terminal program, and become more of a whole mail-processing
&gt; program.  Maybe you should just download your mail file en masse from the
&gt; host to your PC, pre-process it to replace (in place) the incoming encrypted
&gt; messages with plaintext versions (annotated to show validated signatures),
&gt; then run a PC program which will display one message at a time, let you
&gt; reply, save, etc.  This way the decryptions are done before you even look
&gt; at the mail file and incoming encrypted mail is treated on a first class
&gt; basis (the same as other mail).
&gt; 
&gt; Then for outgoing mail you'd like to be able to drop into a user-defined
&gt; editor which is run with a command line causing his file to be saved to
&gt; some temp file name.  Then we can automatically encrypt the outgoing mail
&gt; for him based on the destination, add a remailer chain if requested, etc.  
&gt; Then he gives a command and all his replies and new mail are uploaded and
&gt; sent.

These last 2 paragraphs describe almost exactly what my scripts do!

&gt; This would be pretty tough to do since there are so many different ways
&gt; of sending and receiving mail on host computers.  This would again have
&gt; to be a customizable part of the program, where we could provide modules
&gt; to deal with the common cases of Unix running "mail", elm, mh, etc., and
&gt; perhaps some of the commercial services.  BBS's would ideally be handled
&gt; as well.  Hackers could contribute scripts for supporting their favorite
&gt; mail system.

I find that I need to be a bit more modular with my scripts so that I can call
a different module depending on which type of system I'm on...Working on it at
this moment.
