&gt;Subject: Statement of dissatisfaction with your recent efforts
&gt;To: cert@cert.org
&gt;Date: Wed, 9 Jun 1993 10:59:04 +1000 (EST)
&gt;
&gt;Dear cert et al,
&gt;
&gt;It has come to my notice recently that your organisation has been 
&gt;involved in a number of accusations against individuals and organisations
&gt;with very little to back such accusations. 
&gt;
&gt;I am referring to, and these are the ones I will mention here, the 
&gt;soda.berkeley.edu and the anon.penet.fi sites., both of which ARE
&gt;legitamate in all respects and are SEEN as such by the net.community.
&gt;Your organisations actions, in my personal opinion, consititute a form
&gt;of harrassment of the worse kind, and it basically smells.
&gt;
&gt;Whilst any one with any knowledge of your workings already knows the
&gt;low quality of feedback, lack of helpfulness and general arrogance of
&gt;your methods, it doesnt do you any good at all to set about on a 
&gt;crusade of self-serving actions against those sites or entities or
&gt;groups of individuals you dont like or you see as furthering ideas
&gt;and software that might one day make your life difficult. You will
&gt;alienate a larger proportion of the net.community than you otherwise
&gt;have.
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest in future you take the time to VERIFY, through whatever
&gt;legal means are at your disposal, the authenticity of your information,
&gt;to view yourselves the problems/files and then take whatever action your
&gt;charter states as appropriate. Going off gun-ho and sending ominous form
&gt;letters to people you see as gullible enough to carry out your desires
&gt;really is less than professional.
&gt;
&gt;I fail to see where you get authority for a large proportion of your
&gt;actions, but that is a matter between you and your financiers. Just dont
&gt;expect people to take you seriously if the above scenarios are repeated.
&gt;
&gt;The above is my own personal observations and not those of any other
&gt;individual or organisation, although they are free to explicitly echo
&gt;them if they so desire. As of yet, none have.
&gt;
&gt;Mark.
