&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The following, originating from Mr. Tom Justice (CGFS69A [Prodigy]) and
&gt; authorized for resubmission to other networks, deals with proposed modem
&gt; use fees. It was originally posted on Prodigy a couple of days ago. I would be
&gt; interested in anyone's take on the accuracy of this. I apologize for its
&gt; length but did not want to distort it too much through truncation.
&gt; 
&gt;      "...Two years ago the FCC tried and (with your help and letters of
&gt; protest) failed to institute regulations that would impose additional
&gt; costs on modem users for data communication.
&gt;      "Now they are at it again. A new regulation that the FCC is quietly
&gt; working on will directly affect you as the user of a computer and modem.
&gt; The FCC proposes that users of modems should pay extra charges for the use
&gt; of the publc telephone network which carry their data. In addition
&gt; computer network services would also be charged as much as $6.00 per hour
&gt; per user for the use of the publc telephone network. Obviously these
&gt; charges would be passed on to the consumer. The money is to be collected
&gt; and given to the telephone company in an effort to raise funds lost to
&gt; deregulation. Jim Eason of KGO newstalk radio San Francisco commented on
&gt; the proposal during his afternoon radio program during which he said he
&gt; learned of the new regulation in an article in the New York Times...."
&gt; 
&gt;      In a second post on Prodigy, Mr. Justice suggests writing to various
&gt; regulatory officials to convey the following suggested text:
&gt; 
&gt; "Dear Sir:
&gt;      "Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC proposal which
&gt; would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems on the telephone
&gt; network. This regulation is nothing less than an attempt to restrict free
&gt; exchange of information among the growing number of comptuer users. Calls
&gt; placed using modems require no special telephone equipment, and users of
&gt; modems pay the phone company for use of the network in the form of a
&gt; monthly bill.
&gt;      "In short, a modem call is the same as a voice call and therefore
&gt; should not be subject to any additional regulation...."
&gt; 
&gt;      Mr. Justice ends his second post with the following:
&gt; 
&gt;      "It is important that you act now. The bureaucrats already have it in
&gt; their heads that modem users should subsidize the phone company and are
&gt; now listening to public comment. Please stand up and make it clear that we
&gt; will not stand for any government restriction on the free exchange of
&gt; information.
&gt;      "Pleae deal with this in a TIMELY manner. We can't wait and watch, or
&gt; we will be walked over by government regulations that are trying to
&gt; strangle us."
