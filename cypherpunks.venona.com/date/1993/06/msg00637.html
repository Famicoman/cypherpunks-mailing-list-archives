According to nobody@soda.berkeley.edu:
&gt; There are a couple of problems with the idea of sticking encrypted
&gt; files onto the end of executable files.  The first is, to make this
&gt; easy, you need a program to do it (and to "undo" it).  Well, if someone
&gt; steals your computer and gets access to these files, they will probably
&gt; also get access to this program.  This will tip them off to what you have
&gt; done.

The technique I advocated was so simple, I could code it on my lunch hour at 
work.  I did.  If you didn't want to have such a thing on your machine, you 
could store it remotely, either on an ftp site or a local bbs.  Clean up 
your hard disk and there is no sign of anything.

&gt; This is an example of the general principle that you need to assume that
&gt; your attackers know or can discover the methods you are using, but they
&gt; don't know the keys.

If steganography is to work, we must find ways to make this "principle" invalid.
Strong encryption will protect our "plain-sight-text."  It falls to Data-hiding
to protect our cyphertext.

&gt; Another problem is that encrypted files look different from executable
&gt; files.  Encrypted files have a uniform histogram (that is, all 256 different
&gt; possible byte values are equally frequent), but exe files do not.  The
&gt; appending of an encrypted file to an executable file will be very obvious.
&gt; The exact boundary may not be immediately apparent, but it can probably
&gt; be narrowed down to ten or twenty words without much effort at all.  In
&gt; any case, exe files which have had this treatment will stick out like a
&gt; sore thumb.

I was going to suggest, but Phil beet me to it, that we compress our executables

&gt; Last, XOR'ing a PGP file with a repeated string is probably not a very
&gt; good method.  PGP has a header at the front whose structure is known and
&gt; which has some fixed bytes.  These can be used to immediately recover some

Well, we could do a lot of things here.  We could have the option of xor'ing,
adding, or subtracting....  We could add random bytes to the cyphertext, at 
offsets we specify and memorize....  I still think this could be done, and that
it would work.  If anyone else shares my enthusiasm, I'll try to get it coded up
