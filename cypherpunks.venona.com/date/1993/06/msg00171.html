According to nobody@soda.berkeley.edu:
&gt; 
&gt; From: Hal Finney, &lt;74076.1041@compuserve.com&gt;
&gt;  
&gt; Mike Diehl's system sounds pretty good to me.  You can create messages, 
&gt; encrypt them, upload and send them, as well as downloading, decrypting, and 
&gt; reading messages, all with a nice menu-based interface.  That's what we 
&gt; want, right?
&gt;  
&gt; It sounds like the system would be easily adaptable to other types of hosts, 
&gt; too.  BBS operators could customize the scripts for their particular systems 
&gt; and offer the package.  We could create versions for users of other mail 
&gt; packages than elm on Unix systems, as well as for some of the commercial 
&gt; systems.  You could cover a lot of people this way.

Making it adaptable is what I mean by "cleaning it up a bit." ;^)

&gt; &gt; Well, if you have followed my this far, you either crazy or interested.;^)  
&gt; &gt; It puzzles me why we are contemplating writing our own comm package when so 
&gt; &gt; many good ones are out there that can be made to serve our purposes.  I'm 
&gt; &gt; open to comments.....  Fire away!
&gt;  
&gt; The only real problem I see is the use of Telix.  How much does this program 
&gt; cost?  We can't give away a disk with Telix on it.

Telix is "user supported software."  Registering it costs $39.

&gt;  
&gt; What about Kermit?  It's free and it has a scripting language, but it 
&gt; doesn't sound nearly as advanced as Telix's.  Would it be good enough?  Or 
&gt; are their other free programs which we could use?

I remember kermit's script language as being kinda messy...  At the end of this
message, I will include a portion of my, uncommented, script to compare.  Also,
kermit is (I think) restricted to one xfer protocol, which may not be a good
idea.

&gt; If we could adapt Kermit or some other free program to do what Mike is 
&gt; describing, we could give away floppies with secure and easy-to-use 
&gt; encrypted email handling capabilities, as well as making them available on 
&gt; the net.  People could just get the version they need for their particular 
&gt; mail access.method.  The package would include the communication program, 
&gt; the scripts, and the encryption software.  The user interface would be as 
&gt; Mike described, all menu driven and easy to use.

Well, either way, I will contribute my user-interface if you'all want it.  I'm
not married to telix, but I do think it is very good.  We could write comparable
scripts in every major comm program script language.... I'd have to document
my interface.  But if I decide to port my interface to C, I'd like to change 
a few things, so maybe this is a bit premature.....

&gt; I think this would be a good way to go if we could get past the hurdle of 
&gt; finding a free comm program that would be adequate.
&gt; Note added in proof :)

I don't understand this last comment.  Maybe it's obvious and I'm just tired...
Part of my script system is after my signature.  Note that I hacked in a C
preprocesser, and this is the output from it, just before the script is compiled
Yes, Telix scripts are compiled! ;^)
