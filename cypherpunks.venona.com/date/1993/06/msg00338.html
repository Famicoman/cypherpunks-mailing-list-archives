&gt; &gt; Tim, I'll be glad to teach you how to file a Privacy Act request.
&gt; &gt; It's pretty simple, and it works on all Federal agencies.  You get
&gt; &gt; all records they are keeping on you, with some limited exceptions --
&gt; &gt; and for almost all of those, you get notified of the withholding.
&gt; &gt; If you can identify one or a small number of agencies that might
&gt; &gt; be keeping this "list", we can see if you are on it.  And if we
&gt; &gt; find the list, we can probably get the whole thing under the Freedom
&gt; &gt; of Information Act.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be very interested in hearing more on this...

Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act apply only to 
federal agencies.

Privacy Act
Requests for personal data must be notarized.
If the agency ignores the request, you must appeal under FOIA, since
there are no appeal provisions under the Privacy Act.

You must specify the "Systems of Records" you want searched. These are
listed in the Federal Register and in "Protecting Your Right to Privacy--A Digest of Systems of Records, which you can get from the GPO). I've included the 
ones you probably would want with the FBI or CIA.

You must pre-authorize a dollar amount for search and copying costs.

Attached are some sample letters for the FBI, the CIA and general 
Privacy Act/FOIA.

FOIA requests can be more general, I've got info on that as well.

I am not a lawyer, and this is not intended as legal advice. The info
is out of a wonderful book:

	Biggs, Don.
	How to avoid laywers.

	Includes index.
	1. Forms (Law)--United States. I. Title.
	KF170.B47  1984   347.73'55   84-18636
	ISBN 0-8240-7285-5   347.30755
	ISBN 0-8240-7284-7 (pbk.)

	Garland Publishing, Inc.
	136 Madison Ave.
	New York, NY 10016

It is a bit out of date (1985), but I believe the Privacy Act and FOIA
is still pretty much the same. It has extensive instructions for what
to actually do and what the pitfalls are.
