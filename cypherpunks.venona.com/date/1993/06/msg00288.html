The paranoia is getting out of hand.  Let's take this one point by
point.  I've deleted the poster's name, because this note is just an
example; it's not the only such posting.

	Certainly that may be so.. but in this case they didn't merely
	tell 'you' with a simple note, instead they did atleast 2
	things which really are bothersome and overstepping common
	'courtesy' of merely informing 'you':

``You''?  Who is ``you''?  The CERT note didn't mention any
individual.  They might not have the information.  If they did, it
might be because the account was compromised.  (That was the case the
last time I helped a friend investigate ftp droppings.  In that case,
though, it was only the ftp account, not the login account, so
notifying the owner would not have been damaging.  Btw -- remember the
recent CERT advisory on bugs in the WUSTL ftpd?)

	1) Instead of going directly to the owner of the directory in
	question or the administator of the host they jumped over
	'your' head and went to the domain administrator. I can see
	going to a site administrator if they had reason to believe the
	owner of the directory was doing something illegal.. but then
	again they have no authority to make/enforce/etc any kind of
	laws.  They were just plain out of line. Consider this example
	(and I'll give them the benefit of doubt here that someone
	really did complain to them and they aren't on some witchhunt
	of their own): I am Cert and Mr Von Karman has emailed me to
	say that a /jet/Enigma-cypher-code directory appears to have
	illegal software of some kind.. so I send up my email.. not to
	you.. but to Goldin, the new NASA head that I believe this
	directory owned by you has illegal software on it. Well that is
	a good way to put some bad marks on your record even if you do
	prove it untrue to your boss.. maybe you had just removed the
	evidence before he checks out your acct.. either way he shuts
	down your net access for a while..'just to be sure', and look
	out next time you want a promotion.. can't be to safe.. you
	might be a security risk!

As I said before, they might not know who was involved.  Even if they
did, and even if the account wasn't compromised, it's the SA's
responsibility to investigate.  What if a local user is doing un-
authorized things?  Take this particular case -- they could easily end
up being sued for contributing to copyright infringement.  They might
win -- but defending against a lawsuit is expensive.

	2) They didn't check the system out before hand and blatantly
	said as much.. what kind of service to you is that? my friend
	met a guy who knows bigfoot..but certainly you don't see me
	bothering the people who own the land where bigfoot is supposed
	to live.

Check it out?  How?  Apart from the question of whether or not you want
CERT looking through your directories (and I can just hear the
complaints now -- ``On no evidence but an anonymous tip, CERT logged
in, listed everything, looked for *my* hidden areas that I used to
distribute restricted software, and tied up my link to the Internet for
hours while the downloaded everything in sight'') -- it isn't
feasible.  I just ftp'd to soda for a quick look-see.  A ls-lRa
generated 160K bytes.  Simply screening that takes time.  Many of the
files showed only numeric uid's; the ftpd passwd file was obviously not
up to date.  Even if I knew the suspect files, I might not know who the
responsible user was.  Many of the files had informative names like
``packet123.Z''.  They mirrored the full X11R5 distribution.

How much time and effort should CERT put in?!?!!  A competent SA will
at least know the putative ownership and reliability of the owner of
most of that stuff; CERT sure doesn't (except, of course, for the list
of hackers they may or may not have, and which has been (rightly)
objected to).

	3) They want to confiscate logs from the system.. That sure as
	heck isn't any of their business..

Confiscate?  Confiscate?  They asked for a copy, if available.
``Confiscate'' generally means ``take away''.  They're not taking
anything from you.  If the logs do show anything, it's precisely their
business -- evidence of someone abusing your system (I'm assuming here
that there really was 3rd-party deposits and retrieval of files).
Quick -- how many of those file transfers are coming from stolen
accounts?  In my experience, a goodly number.

Look, I have my own concerns about CERT in this matter, notably the
questions of what evidence they're acting on, and whether or not
they're being used (consciously or not) to silence unpopular sites.
I've sent them a note asking those questions.  But let's try to keep
things in perspective.

Oh yeah -- as an added bonus, I've enclosed a transcript of the kinds
of things I do when trying to find an administrative contact for some
machine.  I don't see any avenues of contact more likely than ``root''
or ``postmaster''.  And it's clearly a large-scale timesharing machine,
where there's no one individual clearly responsible for it.
