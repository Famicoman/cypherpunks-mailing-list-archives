&gt; I recently became aware of an article that you wrote entitled,
&gt; "Notes on Cryptography, Diigital Telephony, and the Bill of
&gt; Rights", which was included in a recent CuD (5.32, Sun May 2,
&gt; 1993). It appeared to be a message you had originally posted to
&gt; the austin.eff newsgroup.
  
I don't recall posting it to that newsgroup, but it doesn't surprise me
that it appeared there. I have strong connections with Austin and with
EFF-Austin.

&gt; Maybe it's just that time of the day or perhaps I just need for you
&gt; to clarify this a bit more -- How does the ECPA offer protection, as
&gt; it is cuurrently written, against warranted search and seizure with
&gt; regards to technologically advanced systems (such as would crypto be
&gt; considered)?

ECPA doesn't mention encryption. It does, however, penalize unauthorized
disclosure of communications. Whether "disclosure" occurs when a
communication is seized, or when it's decrypted, is an open question.

&gt;      "I.  As my notes here suggest, these initiatives may be, in their
&gt; essence, inconsistent with Constitutional guarantees of expression,
&gt; association, and privacy."
&gt;  
&gt; (End Quote)
&gt;  
&gt; You are saying, in effect, that it is your opinion that these
&gt; initiatives may be unconstitutional?

Yes.

&gt; If so, what course of action
&gt; can be suggested, short of a class action lawsuit against an LEA
&gt; after-the-fact?
  
Lawsuits are almost inherently reactive. The best thing is to lobby
Congress for guarantees of the right to encrypt. State legislatures may
also be a useful target.

&gt; By the way, the article was excellent and since I have not seen it
&gt; posted here in cypherpunks, I'd like your permission to repost it.

You have permission to repost it anywhere. I believe it appeared already
in cypherpunks, though. Maybe some people want to see it again.
