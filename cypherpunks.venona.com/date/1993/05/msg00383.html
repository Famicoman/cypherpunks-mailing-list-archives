Well, what can I say about that last message.  That is a rather bothersome
but in my automatic mail system that I've not been able to track down.  In fact,
I can't even duplicate it.  For the record, my system send 2 other messages 
before this one, and they were fine.  Oh well.  Anyway, here is the full
message.

I have included, below, a copy of my pgp menu system.  It is a 4dos batch file.
With this program, you can encrypt, sign and decrypt a message, and generate, 
delete, extract keys, wipe files.  I've been trying to iron out some of the 
bugs for about a month now.  (BTW where did all my alpha testers go?)  I think
it's pretty stable now, so I'm posting it.  To be able to use the program, you
MUST BE USING 4DOS as your command interpreter on your PC.  But, I've found that
this little requirement is well worth the utility that (I hope) my program 
provides.
 
4dos is a command.com replacement that features disk swapping, aliases, file-
name completion, and an extended batch language.  You can get it via anon ftp 
at wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /mirrors/msdos/4dos directory.  It's very much
worth the effort to investigate.  For those of you who do make this effort, I
hope you enjoy using my menu syste.  I hope to hear from you soon.  Thanx.
 
Well, here it is:
