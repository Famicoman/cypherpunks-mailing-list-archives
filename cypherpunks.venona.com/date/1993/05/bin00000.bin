Please ignore this message.  I'm trying to track down just who is on
attmail that is bouncing messages.  The two explicit users of attmail
are not the problem.

The weird messages are nothing other than somebody's badly configured
mailer.  Most bounce messages (all lately except this one) go back to
me, Eric Hughes, your list maintainer, who gets to regularly deal with
this nonsense.

Now I would have bounced this guy off the list already, but I don't
know who it is.  My suspicion is that someone is forwarding mail to
attmail, but doing so improperly.  attmail is bouncing it, but rather
than to the forwarder or to the list maintainer, to the original
sender.

This will continue until whoever it is fixes their setup, or my
sleuthing to find out who it is pays off.  In the interim, don't worry
about it.

I got one, too.  Doesn't look too sinister to me.  Somebody named Bryan Petty  
must have dropped his attmail account without unsubscribing from the list, and  
attmail's gateway sending is the bounces back to the original poster.  Another  
attmail subsriber was getting a feed of comp.org.eff.talk by mail a while back.   
When his mailbox got full, anyone who posted to c.o.e.t. would get a message  
like this one.  Apparently, they never fixed the broken gateway software.
