PUBLIC PARTICIPATION:  
 
This Advisory Board meeting will be devoted to the issue of the
Administration's recently announced government-developed "key escrow"
chip cryptographic technology and, more broadly, to public use of
cryptography and government cryptographic policies and regulations.
The Board has been asked by NIST to obtain public comments on this
matter for submission to NIST for the national review that the
Administration's has announced it will conduct of
cryptographic-related issues.  Therefore, the Board is interested
in: 1) obtaining public views and reactions to the
government-developed "key escrow" chip technology announcement,
"key escrow" technology generally, and government cryptographic
policies and regulations 2) hearing selected summaries of written
views that have been submitted, and 3) conducting a general
discussion of these issues in public.
 
The Board solicits all interested parties to submit well-written,
concise issue papers, position statements, and background
materials on areas such as those listed below.  Industry input is
particularly encouraged in addressing the questions below.  
 
Because of the volume of responses expected, submittors are asked to
identify the issues above to which their submission(s) are responsive.
Submittors should be aware that copyrighted documents cannot be accepted
unless a written waiver is included concurrently with the submission to
allow NIST to reproduce the material.  Also, company proprietary
information should not be included, since submissions will be made
publicly available.
 
This meeting specifically will not be a tutorial or briefing on
technical details of the government-developed "key escrow" chip or
escrowed cryptographic key technologies.  Those wishing to address
the Board and/or submit written position statements are requested
to be thoroughly familiar with the topic and to have concise,
well-formulated opinions on its societal ramifications.
 
Issues on which comments are sought include the following:
 
1.    CRYPTOGRAPHIC POLICIES AND SOCIAL/PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES
 
Public and Social policy aspects of the government-developed "key
escrow" chip and, more generally, escrowed key technology and government
cryptographic policies.
 
Issues involved in balancing various interests affected by government
cryptographic policies.
 
2.    LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
 
Consequences of the government-developed "key escrow" chip technology
and, more generally, key escrow technology and government cryptographic
policies.
 
3.    INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY
 
Issues and impacts of cryptographic-related statutes, regulations, and
standards, both national and international, upon individual privacy.
 
Issues related to the privacy impacts of the government-developed "key
escrow" chip and "key escrow" technology generally.
 
4.    QUESTIONS DIRECTED TO AMERICAN INDUSTRY
 
4.A  Industry Questions: U.S. Export Controls
 
4.A.1 Exports - General 
 
What has been the impact on industry of past export controls on products
with password and data security features for voice or data?
 
Can such an impact, if any, be quantified in terms of lost export sales
or market share?  If yes, please provide that impact.
 
How many exports involving cryptographic products did you attempt over
the last five years?  How many were denied?  What reason was given for
denial?
 
Can you provide documentation of sales of cryptographic equipment which
were lost to a foreign competitor, due solely to U.S. Export Regulations.
 
What are the current market trends for the export sales of information
security devices implemented in hardware solutions?  For software
solutions?
 
4.A.2  Exports - Software
 
If the U.S. software producers of mass market or general purpose software
(word processing, spreadsheets, operating environments, accounting,
graphics, etc.) are prohibited from exporting such packages with file
encryption capabilities, what foreign competitors in what countries are
able and willing to take foreign market share from U.S. producers by
supplying file encryption capabilities?
 
What is the impact on the export market share and dollar sales of the
U.S. software industry if a relatively inexpensive hardware solution
for voice or data encryption is available such as the 
government-developed
"key escrow" chip?
 
What has been the impact of U.S. export controls on COMPUTER UTILITIES
software packages such as Norton Utilities and PCTools?
 
What has been the impact of U.S. export controls on exporters of OTHER
SOFTWARE PACKAGES (e.g., word processing) containing file encryption
capabilities?
 
What information does industry have that Data Encryption Standard (DES)
based software programs are widely available abroad in software
applications programs?
 
4.A.3  Exports - Hardware
 
Measured in dollar sales, units, and transactions, what have been
the historic exports for:
 
            Standard telephone sets

            FAX machines
            Modems
            Telephone switches
 
What are the projected export sales of these products if there is no
change in export control policy and if the government- developed "key
escrow" chip is not made available to industry?
 
What are the projected export sales of these products if the
government-developed "key escrow" chip is installed in the above 
products,
the above products are freely available at an additional price of no more
than $25.00, and the above products are exported WITHOUT ADDITIONAL
LICENSING REQUIREMENTS?
 
What are the projected export sales of these products if the
government-developed "key escrow" chip is installed in the above 
products,
the above products are freely available at an additional price of no more
than $25.00, and the above products are to be exported WITH AN ITAR
MUNITIONS LICENSING REQUIREMENT for all destinations?

government-developed "key escrow" chip is installed in the above
products, the above products are freely available at an additional price
of no more than $25.00, and the above products are to be exported WITH
A DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE LICENSING REQUIREMENT for all destinations?
 
4.A.4  Exports - Advanced Telecommunications 
 
What has been the impact on industry of past export controls on other
advanced telecommunications products?
 
Can such an impact on the export of other advanced telecommunications
products, if any, be quantified in terms of lost export sales or market
share? If yes, provide that impact.
 
4.B  Industry Questions:  Foreign Import/Export Regulations
 
How do regulations of foreign countries affect the import and export of
products containing cryptographic functions?  Specific examples of
countries and regulations will prove useful.

international banking, funds transfer systems, automatic teller
systems, payroll records, financial information, business plans,
competitive strategy plans, cost analyses, research and development
records, technology trade secrets, personal privacy for voice
communications, and so forth?  What might be good sources of such
data?
 
What impact do U.S. Government mandated information security standards
for defense contracts have upon demands by other commercial users for
information security systems in the U.S.?  In foreign markets?
 
What threats are your product designed to protect against?  What threats
do you consider unaddressed?

The Board agenda will include a period of time, not to exceed ten hours,
for oral presentations of summaries of selected written statements
submitted to the Board by May 27, 1993.  As appropriate and to the
extent possible, speakers addressing the same topic will be grouped
together.  Speakers, prescheduled by the Secretariat and notified in
advance, will be allotted fifteen to thirty minutes to orally present
their written statements. Individuals and organizations submitting
written materials are requested to advise the Secretariat if they
would be interested in orally summarizing their materials for the
Board at the meeting.
 
Another period of time, not to exceed one hour, will be reserved for
oral comments and questions from the public.  Each speaker will be
allotted up to five minutes; it will be necessary to strictly control
the length of presentations to maximize public participation and the
number of presentations.
 
Except as provided for above, participation in the Board's discussions
during the meeting will be at the discretion of the Designated Federal
Official.
 
Approximately thirty seats will be available for the public, including
three seats reserved for the media.  Seats will be available on a
first-come, first-served basis.

I didn't see "Clipper" or "Capstone" or "SkipJack" mention once in the 
entire post. What did they do -- drop the name?
 
I'm starting on my own submission for presentation tonight...
 
Cheers.
