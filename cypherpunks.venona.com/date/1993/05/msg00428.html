I do not want just "interim" documents. I want all documents as they
appear in the "main" files and "see references" of all units of 
your agency.
      If documents are denied in whole or in part, please specify 
which exemption(s) is(are) claimed for each passage or whole 
document denied. Please provide a complete itemized inventory and 
a detailed factual justification of total or partial denial of 
documents. Give the number of pages in each document and the 
total number of pages pertaining to this request. For 
"classified" material denied please include the following 
information: the classification (confidential, secret or top 
secret); identity of the classifier; date or event for automatic 
de-classification, classification review, or down-grading; if 
applicable, identity of official authorizing extension of 
automatic de-classification or review; and if applicable, the 
reason for extended classification.
     I request that excised material be "blacked out" rather 
than "whited out" or cut out and that the remaining non-exempt 
portions of documents will be released as provided under the 
Freedom of Information Act.
     Please send a memo (copy to me) to the appropriate units in 
your office to assure that no records related to this request are 
destroyed. Please advise of any destruction of records and 
include the date of and authority for such destruction.
     As I expect to appeal any denials, please specify the office 
and address to which an appeal should be directed.
     I believe my request qualifies for a waiver of fees since 
the release of the requested information would primarily benefit 
the general public and be "in the public interest."
     I can be reached at the phone listed below. Please call 
rather than write if there are any questions or if you need 
additional information from me.
     I expect a response to this request within ten (10) working 
days, as provided for in the Freedom of Information Act.
 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL LETTER
 
Date:
To:  FOIA/PA Appeals Office
RE:  Request number [Add this if the agency has given your request 
a number]
     This is an appeal pursuant to subsection (a)(6) of the 
Freedom of Information Act as amended (5U.S.C. 552).
     On [date], I received a letter from [name of official] of 
your agency denying my request for [describe briefly the 
information you are after]. This reply indicated that an appeal 
letter could be sent to you. I am enclosing a copy of my exchange 
of correspondence with your agency so that you can see exactly 
what files I have requested and the insubstantial grounds on 
which my request has been denied.
     [Optional paragraph, to be used if the agency has withheld 
all or nearly all the material which has been requested]:
     You will note that your agency has withheld the entire (or 
nearly the entire) document (or file, or report, or whatever) 
that I requested. Since the FOIA provides that "any reasonably 
secregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person 
requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are 
exempt," I believe that your agency has not complied with the 
FOIA. I believe that there must be (additional) secregable 
portions which do not fall within FOIA exemptions and which must 
be released.
     [Optional paragraph, to be used in the agency has used the 
(b)(1) exemption for national security, to withhold information]
     Your agency has used the (b)(1) exemption to withhold 
information [I question whether files relating to events that 
took place over twenty years ago could realistically harm the 
national security.] [Because I am familiar with my own activities 
during the period in question, and know that none of these 
activities in any way posed a significant threat to the national 
security, I question the designation of my files or portions of 
my file as classified and exempt from disclosure because of
national security considerations.]
     [Sample optional argument to be used if the exemption which 
is claimed does not seem to make sense; you should cite as many 
specific instances as you care to of items withheld from the 
documents that you have received. We provide two examples which 
you might want to adapt to your own case.]
     "On the memo dated _____________ the second paragraph 
withheld under the (b)(1) exemption appears to be describing a 
conversation at an open meeting. If this is the case, it is 
impossible that the substance of this conversation could be 
properly classified." Or, "The memo dated _____ refers to a 
meeting which I attended, but a substantial portion is deleted 
because of the (b)(6) and (b)(7)(c) exemptions for unwarranted 
invasions of personal privacy. Since I already know who attended 
this meeting, no privacy interest is served by the withholding."
     I trust that upon examination of my request, you will 
conclude that the records I requested are not properly covered by 
exemption(s) [here repeat the exemptions which the agency's 
denial letter claimed applied to your request] of the amended 
FOIA, and that you will overrule the decision to withhold the 
information.
     [Use if an itemized inventory is not supplied originally]
     If you choose instead to continue to withhold some or all of 
the material which was denied in my initial request to your 
agency, I ask that you give me an index of such material, 
together with the justification for the denial of each item which 
is still withheld.
     As provided in the Act, I will expect to receive a reply to 
this administrative appeal letter within twenty working days.
     If you deny this appeal and do not adequately explain why 
the material withheld is properly exempt, I intend to initial a 
lawsuit to compel its disclosure. [You can say that you intend to 
sue, if that is your present inclination; you may still decide 
ultimately not to file suit.]
 
Sincerely yours,
