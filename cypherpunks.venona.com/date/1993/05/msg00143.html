&gt;The President
&gt;The White House
&gt;Washington, D.C.  20500
&gt;
&gt;Dear Mr. President:
&gt;
&gt;        On April 16 you initiated a broad industry/government review of
&gt;privacy and cryptography policies. We applaud your efforts to develop a
&gt;greater understanding of these complex issues.  With the end of the Cold
&gt;War and the rapid evolution of technology in the computer and
&gt;communications industries, a comprehensive review of our communications
&gt;security policies such as you have directed is sorely needed.  As the world
&gt;becomes linked by a myriad of interconnected digital networks, and computer
&gt;and communications technologies converge, both government and the private
&gt;sector need to evaluate information security and privacy issues. Of course,
&gt;any overall policy must recognize the authorized law enforcement and
&gt;national security needs, and must evaluate the impact on American
&gt;competitiveness.
&gt;
&gt;        The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group -- a coalition of
&gt;communications and computer companies and associations, and consumer and
&gt;privacy advocates -- was formed almost a decade ago when Congress undertook
&gt;a review of technology and security policy.  That review led to the
&gt;Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.  Subsequently, many members
&gt;of the Working Group served on the Privacy and Technology Task Force that
&gt;Senator Leahy charged with examining these and similar issues in 1991.   
&gt;
&gt;        While we recognize the importance of authorized national security
&gt;and law enforcement needs, we believe that there are fundamental privacy
&gt;and other constitutional rights that must be taken into account when any
&gt;domestic surveillance scheme is proposed.  Moreover, it is unclear how your
&gt;proposal and the overall review of cryptography policy will impact on U.S.
&gt;export controls.  Over the past two years, the Digital Privacy and Security
&gt;Working Group has held numerous meetings at which both public and private
&gt;sector representatives have exchanged technical and legal information with
&gt;the law enforcement community on just such issues.  
&gt;
&gt;        In the White House press release of April 16, the Press Secretary
&gt;stated that you have "directed early and frequent consultations with
&gt;affected industries...and groups that advocate the privacy rights of
&gt;individuals..."  Our group of over 50 members -- from computer software and
&gt;hardware firms, to telecommunications companies and energy companies, to
&gt;the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation
&gt;-- requests the opportunity to participate in developing policy on the
&gt;broad range of security and privacy issues being considered, including
&gt;appropriate encryption techniques.  We believe that our membership has the
&gt;breadth and depth of expertise and experience that would allow us to
&gt;provide an excellent forum for the development of new policies in these
&gt;areas.
&gt;        During the past few weeks, the Working Group has met several times
&gt;to identify issues that need to be addressed.  Several aspects of the
&gt;Administration's encryption proposal warrant further discussion, including,
&gt;but not limited to: 
&gt;
&gt;        o       whether a key escrow system will produce the desired law
&gt;enforcement results; 
&gt;        o       the level of strength and integrity of the algorithm and
&gt;the security of the key escrow system; 
&gt;        o       the advisability of a government-developed and classified
&gt;algorithm; 
&gt;        o       its practicality and commercial acceptability; 
&gt;        o       the effect of the proposal on American competitiveness and
&gt;the balance of trade;
&gt;        o       possible implications for the development of digital
&gt;communications; and, 
&gt;        o       the effect on the right to privacy and other constitutional
&gt;rights.
&gt;
&gt;A detailed list of our questions relating to this subject is being prepared
&gt;to facilitate this dialogue.
&gt;
&gt;        We are making our views known to officials within your
&gt;Administration and Members of Congress as the review begins.  We would
&gt;welcome the opportunity to participate in the review process and look
&gt;forward to working with you and your Administration on this important issue
&gt;in the coming months.  Representatives of the Digital Privacy and Security
&gt;Working Group are anxious to meet with your staff at their earliest
&gt;convenience to establish a consultation process.         
&gt;
&gt;                                        Sincerely,
