       And John Gilmore Spake:

(Much Deleted)
   &gt; To permanently restore at least last month's level of service, we need
   &gt; a couple of dedicated, firewalled, buttressed sites.  You want a few
   &gt; geographically separated people who own their own systems (or who own
   &gt; or run the company that owns them), who have solid network links
   &gt; (possibly redundant), and who are fully committed to the idea -- as
   &gt; committed as funet.fi to persist past the vilification and harassment
   &gt; and threats.
   &gt; 
   &gt; And those people need backup from the rest of us -- legal help if they
   &gt; need or want it, money to pay the networking bill if things get tight,
   &gt; loans of backup equipment during failures under load, system
   &gt; administration when folks try to break in and trash their machines,
   &gt; software creation and maintenance, advocacy, policy work, advice, and
   &gt; a bunch of shoulders to cry on and warm words of encouragement.
   &gt; 
   &gt; Three to five people providing such setups, in collaboration, would
   &gt; wedge a steel-toed boot so firmly in the door that it couldn't be
   &gt; slammed by any dyspeptic "net god".
   &gt; 
   &gt; Are we up to this job?  If not, let's scale back what we're trying to
   &gt; do.  I'd rather succeed at raising consciousness on the issue for a
   &gt; later try, than try now to set up such a beachhead and fail at it.

	John

I am forced to agree with you here..... I dont think we have
the "juice" to carry off a maximum effort at this point...
I would gladly volunteer to setup such a site AND I would
need a peacenet feed instead of the "gratis" connections
I obtain from netcom.... I AM already uncoercible... as
you well know and I would need you as well as others in backing
on this effort...OK kids... Here we have one volunteer if we can get 
at least 3 other sites(my mininum buyin is 4 US sites)....
Hey John... what about you???
      cheers
      kelly
p.s. I would be willing to maintain a PAX type anon operation
as well as an anon-remailer.....and a KEY server...
 would also offer the PGP archives via mail server...
note that I am uucp connected and would need to upgrade
to 56 kb leased or V-FAST technology...
