<PRE>
We brainstormed questions and issues resulting from Clinton's crypto policy
review and `Clipper' proposal.  Here's the raw results.

Cypherpunks, please read it over; clarify your own questions if they
didn't get transcribed correctly, and send me the updates (as Unix diffs
or context diffs) at:  gnu@toad.com.

I'll collate the changes, and repost this document to cypherpunks.
When we're happy with it, the group can disseminate it to sci.crypt, 
news media, or whoever else.

	John Gilmore
