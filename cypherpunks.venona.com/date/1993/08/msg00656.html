&gt;Quoth Paul L. Moses, verily I say unto thee:
&gt;- -=&gt;
&gt;- -=&gt;Regarding the Electronic Democracy idea, I vote with Tim May.  Look at the
&gt;
&gt;Just the opposite here.
&gt;
&gt;One factor has been missing from this discussion.  
&gt;
&gt;Representative "democracy" is a statist imposition.
&gt;
&gt;One other factor:
&gt;
&gt;The number of issues to be voted on is quite large.  Even with easy access
&gt;via cable-tv data networks, public voting kiosks, etc, no one will be able
&gt;to keep up.  This will immediately result in demand for LESS legislation,
&gt;which is a good thing no matter how you look at it.  
&gt;
&gt;Simple requirements for quorums before a proposition comes up for voting
&gt;would head off most goofy bills right from the start.  If you have to have
&gt;at least, say, 10% of the population to vote to ALLOW AN ISSUE TO EVEN BE
&gt;VOTED ON, most idiot bills will be nipped in the bud.  One other thing
&gt;you'll see disappear is "private laws".  Our congress wastes an incredible
&gt;amount of time and money working on laws that affect only one corporation,
&gt;or one small area.  For one thing, most of this stuff is irrelevant as far
&gt;as the Law of the Land goes.  It's not something our legislature should be
&gt;involved in.  Let companies work out their own damn problems.  For
&gt;another, local-area laws should be handled by local areas.  Period.
&gt;In my opinion.
&gt;
&gt;The main objection I keep seeing is that all them loonies will vote for
&gt;stupid laws.  I'd like to ask you how many of these people vote NOW?  Not
&gt;very many.  The idiotic, the lazy, and the careless do not vote, by and
&gt;large.  The people that vote are the people that think about issues, and
&gt;decide that they want to do something about them.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, when some of this comes about, and it is quite inevitable, I would
&gt;hope that a very least e-voting gives the people veto power, to directly
&gt;overturn anything passed by congress and the prez, and even the power to
&gt;kill bills before they even get past the discussion stage.  Add to that
&gt;the right to directly propose legislation, provided there is a quorum, and
&gt;I think that would be a good starting point.
&gt;
&gt;If all Tim and others with the same views are upset about is that a sudden
&gt;change could result in utter chaos, I have no argument with that.  The
&gt;changes must be gradual, so as to not cause a governmental backlash.  I
&gt;can see just installing the system and cutting congress out of the picture
&gt;entirely.  The resulting mess would be allowed to go on for about a month,
&gt;before the pres declared martial law due to national emergency, and then
&gt;it'd be all over.  One thing that irritates the hell out of me about many
&gt;anarch[o-capital]ists and libertarians, is an all or nothing stance.  Some
&gt;of you folks don't seem to clue to the ideas of compromise, gradual
&gt;change, long-term planning, and strategic retreat to throw an enemy off
&gt;balance.  You aren't going to take the world by storm, and Tim's dire
&gt;predictions of a hell hole that would result if such occured are right on
&gt;the mark. Play our cards right, and we'll take the world by whispering breeze.
