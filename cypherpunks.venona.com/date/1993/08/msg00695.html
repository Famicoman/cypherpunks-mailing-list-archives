Well said, Eric.

There's no reason for people to assume that "We're all [fill
in name of your political faction] here."  We've got a common
goal/program and happily we agree on many of the most crucial
political issues.  Everything seems to work fine without subtle
swipes at other people's views or egocentric assumptions about
what we all believe.  Some people on this list, for example,
are staunch anti-capitalists, but we're polite enough to hold
off on the capitalist- and spectacle-bashing rhetoric because
we generally respect other people's views and realize that
there's no good in it.

Recently, one bonehead posted a message stating, in effect, that
this is an Extropian list.  That is, of course, nonsense, but
even more, it's obnoxious, egomaniacal, and pointless.  This
is a very diverse list, but I think we know what assumptions
are NOT shared by everyone.  Your remark did seem like a blatant
taunt, Perry.

&gt; From: hughes@ah.com (Eric Hughes)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Charge you for performing services? Shudder -- how horrible!
&gt; &gt;Capitalism! Ohmygod!
&gt; 
&gt; I count this comment as an intentional misreading of my position.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not a libertarian, nor is it likely that I ever will be.  I've
&gt; also read E. F. Schumacher's _Small is Beautiful_ and thought much of
&gt; it was just plain wrong, or, at best, unprovable.  
&gt; 
&gt; I read your words as an attempt to enforce a sort of libertarian
&gt; political correctness, as insulting as that phrase will no doubt be to
&gt; you.
&gt; 
&gt; The agenda of privacy is orthogonal to most partisan political
&gt; positions.  As strong as the libertarian presence is on this list, it
&gt; is by no means the only view.  It is precisely because cypherpunk
&gt; issues cut clean across the political spectrum that they are so
&gt; powerful.
&gt; 
&gt; I expect no one here to wear seamless garments of any cut or cloth.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many on this list whose personal agendas call for making the
&gt; world safe for greater accumulations of capital.  This is not at all
&gt; my agenda, yet I have put aside my repugnance at this in pursuit of a
&gt; common goal.  While I expect no one to hold to any particular view,
&gt; I do expect that everyone here treat opposing views with respect, or
&gt; better yet, with silence.
