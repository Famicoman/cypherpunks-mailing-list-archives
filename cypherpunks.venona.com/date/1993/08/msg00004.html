              A LETTER FROM THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY            
 
                            August 1993 
 
TRACKING DEVELOPMENTS IN TRUSTED SYSTEMS
The 16th National Computer Security Conference, to be held
September 20-23, 1993, at the Baltimore Convention Center, will
dedicate a full track to Information Technology (IT) Security
Criteria and Evaluation.  The track will expand on the
collaborative effort between the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to
develop a security criteria document suitable for use by both 
government and industry.  The objectives are to enhance the
development and evaluation of IT products with security features
and to develop an extensible and flexible framework for defining
new requirements for IT security products that will be used by
the international IT community.
 
The new track will focus on IT security criteria efforts over the
last year.  An introduction to the Federal Criteria will be
followed by tutorials on protection profile development and the
potential ways in which profiles may be reviewed and registered
for use by product developers, customers, and evaluators.  Other
panel discussions will include a comparison of the current
evaluation processes in North America and Europe and a report on
the status and plans for a commercial security evaluation process
in the U.S.
 
The track will also feature a panel discussion on a new
international project to develop common IT security criteria that
will align existing national criteria.  NIST and NSA officials
announced the project during the Federal Criteria Invitational
Workshop, held on June 2-3, 1993.  The project is a joint
activity of the governments of the U.S., Canada, and European
nations.  Six government IT security officials from these nations
have formed the Common Criteria Editorial Board (CCEB). 
Presenting their perspectives, CCEB panel members will describe
their work, the starting documents, and the timetable for planned
draft criteria, review, and trial use periods.
 
Ellen Flahavin, coordinator for the Criteria and Evaluation
track, expects IT professionals from around the world to attend
these sessions.  For specific information on the track, contact
Ellen at NIST, Computer Systems Laboratory, POLY A241,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001, telephone (301) 975-3871.  For
general information on the computer security conference, see the
Upcoming Technical Conferences section of the newsletter.  We
welcome your participation in the 16th National Computer Security
Conference and look forward to seeing you at the Baltimore
Convention Center at the Inner Harbor in September.
 
FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS (FIPS) ACTIVITIES
Secure Hash Standard Approved for Federal Agency Use
On May 11, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce approved FIPS 180,
Secure Hash Standard, for use by federal agencies in protecting
unclassified information that is not subject to section 2315 of
Title 10, United States Code, or section 3502(2) of Title 44,
United States Code.  To be effective October 15, 1993, FIPS 180
specifies a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) which can be used to
generate a condensed representation of a message called a message
digest.  The SHA is required for use with the planned Digital
Signature Algorithm (DSA) and whenever a secure hash algorithm is
required for federal applications.  Private and commercial
organizations are encouraged to adopt and use the standard.
 
The SHA is used by both the transmitter and intended receiver of
a message in computing and verifying a digital signature. 
Appropriate applications of the SHA include electronic mail,
electronic funds transfer, software distribution, data storage,
and other applications which require data integrity assurance and
data origin authentication.  The SHA may be implemented in
software, firmware, hardware, or any combination. Implementations
of the SHA will be validated by NIST. 
 
Secretary of Commerce Approves POSIX Revision
FIPS 151-1, POSIX:  Portable Operating System Interface for
Computer Environments, has been revised to adopt International
Standard ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990, Information Technology--Portable
Operating System Interface (POSIX)--Part 1:  System Application
Program Interface (API) [C Language] which defines a C
programming language source interface to an operating system
environment.  Effective October 15, 1993, the revised standard
will be published as FIPS 151-2 and supersedes FIPS 151-1 in its
entirety.  FIPS 151-2 will maximize the federal return on
investment in generating or purchasing computer programs by
enhancing operating system compatibility.
 
Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) Standard Revised
The Secretary of Commerce approved a revision to FIPS 128, CGM,
which will be published as FIPS 128-1.  The revised standard
adopts the redesignated version of the CGM standard known as
ANSI/ISO 8632.1-4:1992; adds a requirement for the use of
profiles which define the options, elements, and parameters of
ANSI/ISO 8632 necessary to accomplish a particular function and
to maximize the probability of interchange between systems
implementing the profile; and adopts the first such profile, the
military specification MIL-D-28003A, November 15, 1991, known as
the CALS (Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support) CGM
Application Profile.
 
FIPS 128-1 is a graphics data interface standard which specifies
a file format suitable for the description, storage, and
communication of graphical (pictorial) information in a device-
independent manner.  The standard facilitates the transfer of
graphical information between different graphical software
systems, different graphical devices, and different computer
graphics installations.
 
The revised standard becomes effective October 15, 1993.  The use
of the CGM Application Profile is mandatory October 15, 1994.  We
encourage agencies to use the application profile in acquisitions
initiated during this period.
 
Revision of FIPS for Database Language SQL
On May 12, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce approved a substantial
enhancement of FIPS 127-1, SQL.  Effective December 3, 1993, the
revised standard will be published as FIPS 127-2 and replaces
FIPS 127-1 in its entirety.  FIPS 127-2 is mandatory for all
federal procurements of relational model database management
systems.  The revised SQL standard adds significant new features
for schema definition, diagnostics management, integrity
constraints, and international character set support, as well as
new data types, new table operations, and enhanced data
manipulation expressions.  A new Information Schema makes all
schema data available to applications.
 
FIPS 127-2 is specified in four separate conformance levels: 
Entry SQL, Transitional SQL, Intermediate SQL, and Full SQL. 
Although only Entry SQL is required, initially, for conformance
to FIPS 127-2, a higher conformance level may be specified as
mandatory in individual agency procurements.  The NIST SQL Test
Suite, Version 4.0, provides conformance tests for the Entry SQL
level of FIPS 127-2.  Future versions of the test suite will
evaluate other FIPS SQL conformance levels.  We invite you to
call Joan Sullivan on (301) 975-3258 for order information on the
NIST SQL Test Suite.  
 
Input/Output Interface Standards Withdrawn
Effective May 11, 1993, eight FIPS have been withdrawn because
the technical specifications that they adopt are obsolete and are
no longer supported by industry.  The standards include:
 
--   FIPS 60-2, I/O Channel Interface, revised December 18, 1990.
     
--   FIPS 61-1, Channel Level Power Control Interface, revised
     December 18, 1990.
 
--   FIPS 62, Operational Specifications for Magnetic Tape
     Subsystems, revised December 18, 1990.
 
--   FIPS 63-1, Operational Specifications for Variable Block
     Rotating Mass Storage Subsystems, revised December 18, 1990;
     Supplement to FIPS 63-1, Additional Operational
     Specifications for Variable Block Rotating Mass Storage
     Subsystems, revised December 18, 1990.
 
--   FIPS 97, Operational Specifications for Fixed Block Rotating
     Mass Storage Subsystems, revised December 18, 1990.
 
--   FIPS 111, Storage Module Interfaces (with extensions for
     enhanced storage module interfaces), revised December 18,
     1990.
 
--   FIPS 130, Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI), revised
     December 18, 1990.
 
--   FIPS 131, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), revised
     December 18, 1990.
