                   Cyberjockying in the 21st Century

How will supernetworks transport you to the far reaches of the data
galaxy?  What is the current status of the internet and other
"information highways"? What can these "highways" do for you today?

This next Sunergy live broadcast will focus on the issues and
technologies surrounding the worldwide movement of information.  It
will take a look at the internet, information suppliers, information
retrievers and the other related resources.  Discussions will also
include regulation and security on the internet. Some current
technologies will be demonstrated.

Guests include:

John Gage        - Director of the Science Office, SMCC
Whitfield Diffie - Distinguished Engineer, Security - SMCC
Carl Malamud     - President, Internet Multicasting Service
Brewster Kahle   - President, WAIS Inc

If you wish to downlink this broadcast, please send email to
david.howard@Sun.COM or phone the Sunergy office at +1 415/336-5847

Program is available on satellites over Europe (west, central and east),
Canada, Latin America and the US.

Whitfield Diffie
Distinguished Engineer
Sun Microsystems

Whitfield Diffie is best known for his 1975 discovery of
the concept of public key cryptography, for which he was recently
awarded a Doctorate in Technical Sciences (Honoris Causa) by the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.

For a dozen years prior to assuming his present position in 1991,
Diffie was Manager of Secure Systems Research for Northern Telecom,
functioning as the center of expertise in advanced security
technologies throughout the corporation.  Among his achievements in
this position was the design of the key management architecture for
NT's recently released PDSO security system for X.25 packet networks.

Diffie received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965.  Prior to
becoming interested in cryptography, he worked on the development of
the Mathlab symbolic manipulation system --- sponsored jointly at
Mitre and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory --- and later on
proof of correctness of computer programs at Stanford University.  He
is the recipient of the IEEE Information Theory Society Best Paper
Award for 1979 and the IEEE Donald E. Fink award for 1981.

Brewster Kahle
President
Wide Area Information Servers, Inc.

Inventor and architect of the WAIS electronic publishing system, Brewster
Kahle has lead the multi-company effort to build a practical system for
end-users to find and retrieve information from servers worldwide.  Before
this work, he helped design and build parallel supercomputers at Thinking
Machines Corporation.

Brewster was schooled at MIT in Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence.
