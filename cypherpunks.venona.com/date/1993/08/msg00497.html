&gt; A simpler variation...
&gt; Customer sends cash or money order to digital bank, along with a floppy
&gt; with an anonymous email address (via a remailer) and a public key.  

For any real business, the customer comes from the 99.99% 
of the population that are not hacker/cypherpunks, not the one or two 
dozen people who are.  These protocols aren't at all simple for the 
customer, unless the vendor (the same or another vendor) provides some 
free software on the net or by mail to automate the process (eg PGP with 
a user-freindly shell for generating the key, and a script for creating 
an anon e-mail address).  But then we have several steps:
	(1) customer reads ad about cool net.service
		(a) they contact directly (but this ruins privacy)
		(b) they contact independent distributor of
		PGP key and anon-remail address generating software.
		(but how does customer trust _them_?)
	(2) vendor sends key &amp; address generators (via e-mail or floppy),
	and physical-mail-security instructions
	(3) customer sends in money order (from mail drop or without
	return address!) along with chosen anon e-mail address and public 
	key.
	(4) vendor sets up account and e-mails the d-cash.
	(5) we still need a physical mail drop or bearer bank
		account for withdrawals, refunds, etc. of physical cash.

Pretty exhausting for the typical service industry.  Most customers
will pick the service that's easier to sign up for, even if some
ivory-tower critics criticize its security.  Security and privacy
are very easy to hype, but often difficult to prove to the layman,
who doesn't know or care about the math.  Digressing a bit,
we could use some sort of independent (not government-run please!)
certification company, which takes (perhaps in alliance with
liability insurance providers) responsibility for examining the 
service's computer programs and protocols and giving out "privacy ratings".
Secure vendors could then use "Whit Diffie certified, top privacy
rating" in their ads.

Also, the issue of which parts of these schemes are *legal*
is critical, but being completely overlooked.  Any lawyers
out there with comments on this?  The best protocols for legal and
illegal operations may be very different, legality of digital cash
will vary between jurisdictions, etc.  And what about
certifying agencies that call a protocol "insecure" 
simply because it supports activities illegal in their jurisdiction, 
not for any reasons of physical or software privacy?
The cases of illegality and physical/software security are
both important risk factors for the vendor, customers, and
liability insurers to consider, but ratings for each should
be quite distinct.

But this discussion is too abstract. We need a real, visceral example.
The enclosure below illustrates some of the some legal and privacy
issues of a Mom &amp; Pop BBS operation in the pre-d-cash era.  This
service could use some privacy -- it's an on-line football game 
with a $35 sign-up fee and cash "prizes."  I don't know whether or not
it's legal for the vendor, but it's certainly illegal for a significant 
subset of potential net.customers.  There will be thousands of these 
little on-line services springing up in the near future, if there 
aren't already.  The BBS# is area code (802), but I've lost the rest 
of it, sorry.  You can call their voice# toll-free for more info.
