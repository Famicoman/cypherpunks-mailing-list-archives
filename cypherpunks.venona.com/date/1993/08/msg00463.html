			    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

     PSI, MORNING STAR TEAM UP TO PROVIDE SECURE INTERNET CONNECTIONS

HERNDON, VA., August 16, 1993 -- Performance Systems International, Inc.
(PSI), the largest provider of corporate Internet access, today announced
a service using an encryption technique that promises unparalleled
security for data transmissions at an affordable cost.

Combining forces with Morning Star Technologies of Columbus, Ohio,
and its brand new Morning Star Express Router which includes MST's unique
DES encryption facility, PSI has developed a service called SecureStream. 
Utilizing an Express Router at both ends of a data link, the service will
encrypt data from transmission to receipt.  It can be de-encrypted only
by a special key possessed by the SecureStream user.

PSI will offer SecureStream as an option to users of its InterFrame
Standard internetwork service, the company's premier product for Frame
Relay access to the Internet.  The cost will be $400 per month, according
to Martin Schoffstall, PSI's vice president and chief technical officer.
"This price is a fraction of the cost of competing Internet service
providers," said Kimberly Brown, manager of marketing communications for PSI.

"By offering high-level encryption at reasonable cost, we feel SecureStream
will provide medium-sized companies security in their Internet transmissions
that was previously beyond their reach," Schoffstall said.  He added that
the product will be demonstrated at next week's INTEROP West in San Francisco.

"We are pleased to offer our Express Router in conjunction with PSI's
SecureStream service," said K. James Laskey, Morning Star's director of sales.
"The Express Router is a high-performance, cost-effective solution for the
most demanding TCP/IP networking applications.  Providing encryption in the
router meets the need of many Internet users to protect sensitive
transmissions from interception."

As a reseller, PSI offers the Express Router for $1,995, the company said.

Laskey and Schoffstall noted that the Express Router is based on
Morning Star's PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) software, designed as a
replacement for the Serial Line IP (SLIP) protocol.  It has been adopted
as an Internet standard, correcting many of the deficiencies in SLIP,
including address negotiation, link level error correction and synchronous
support for high speed communications. In addition, it supports Frame Relay
and the Internet standard RFC-1294.

PSI offers a variety of services and products to provide corporate
and individual computer users with access to the Internet.  In addition to
leased-line services, it offers a number of dial-up services and a wireless
e-mail service over the RAM Mobile Data network.
