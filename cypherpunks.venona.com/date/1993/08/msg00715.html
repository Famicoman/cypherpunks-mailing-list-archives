Subject: SEA Opposes Privatization of Digital Signature Standard (fwd)

&gt; August 19, 1993                                   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt;
&gt; CONTACT:    Simona Nass
&gt;             (212) 982-4320 or simona@sea.org
&gt;
&gt;             Society for Electronic Access (SEA) Opposes
&gt;             Privatization of Digital Signature Standard
&gt;
&gt; In June, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)
&gt; published in the Federal Register its intention to grant an exclusive
&gt; license for nongovernmental use of the Digital Signature Algorithm
&gt; (DSA), a technique developed for NIST by federally-funded researchers.
&gt; DSA can help people authenticate the origin of electronic mail and
&gt; other computerized messages. NIST has proposed making DSA the basis of
&gt; a standard for digital signatures for transactions within federal
&gt; agencies and by anyone doing electronic business with the government
&gt; (and thus, de facto, by anyone else interested in a widely-accepted
&gt; digital-signature standard). Interested parties were given 60 days to
&gt; comment. The SEA has now gone on record opposing this license on three
&gt; grounds:
&gt;
&gt;   1) The law requires an open discussion of whether such an exclusive 
&gt; license serves the interests of both the government and the public
&gt; _before_ the license and its terms are proposed.
&gt; 
&gt;   2) The proposed license directly contravenes NIST's stated purpose
&gt; in developing DSA in the first place, which was to make a
&gt; digital-signature standard free of encumbrance from privately held
&gt; patent licenses, one that would be available royalty-free worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt;   3) The proposed license violates federal law governing the granting
&gt; of exclusive licenses. The law states that an exclusive license can
&gt; only be granted for a patent if it can be shown that the technology
&gt; embodied in the patent would not otherwise be developed, brought to
&gt; market and widely used. Considering that NIST's proposed licensee,
&gt; Public Key Partners, is currently engaged in legal action to prevent
&gt; anyone else from developing or marketing digital-signature technology
&gt; in the U.S., they appear to be an unlikely choice to ensure the widest
&gt; possible use of DSA. Indeed, granting an exclusive license to PKP
&gt; would extend their potential legal monopoly on digital signatures
&gt; until 2010.
&gt;
&gt; Opposition to the NIST/PKP deal has been widespread throughout the
&gt; electronic community. NIST has yet to respond to the SEA's August 9
&gt; filing, or to comments filed by other organizations (a full text of
&gt; the SEA's statement, written by SEA board member Clay Shirky, is
&gt; available via Internet gopher -- reach gopher.panix.com and look under
&gt; Society for Electronic Access (SEA), Telecom Law Information, SEA
&gt; Comment on NIST-PKP Agreement -- or via e-mail by sending a request
&gt; asking for the "SEA Comment on NIST-PKP Agreement" to sea@sea.org).
&gt;
&gt; The Society for Electronic Access is a New York-based organization
&gt; focusing on electronic civil liberties and access issues; for more
&gt; information, e-mail sea-info@sea.org; write to The Society for
&gt; Electronic Access, Post Office Box 3131, Church Street Station,
&gt; New York, NY 10008-3131; or call (212) 982-4320.
