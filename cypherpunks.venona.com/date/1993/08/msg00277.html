Letter writers needed ASAP! This is the bill that will open up
legislative databases to the masses and serve as a model for other
states and even the country!

cypherfolks, do you have any idea what these efforts are the faint
glimmers of? Imagine a future society where *anyone* can propose laws,
not just the elite few called Legislators and identified in an
exceedingly time-consuming, tedious, and troublesome process. Imagine
that everyone has complete access and full understanding of all the
laws that affect one's life, and the ability to propose and *pass*
superior modifications. It would be a sort of Legislative Free
Enterprise, a competition in the marketplace of laws such that superior
ones would prosper and inferior, archaic, and absurd laws would be
rooted out and expunged by the citizenry itself, in a very dynamic,
interactive, and responsive process! Far from this bureacratic
nightmare we lumber in daily! Write that small letter to set in motion
this grandiose cyberspatial karma!

&gt;Subject: UPDATE #21-AB1624: *ACTION ALERT*: END-GAME APPROACHING (&amp; misc notes)
&gt;
&gt;[MODERATOR'S NOTE: This is a California bill, but its outcome could set
&gt;a precedent which would help or hurt similar efforts in other states,
&gt;including Texas.  If you've got friends in California, you might want
&gt;to pass this along to them.  -- Prentiss Riddle, riddle@tic.com]
&gt;
&gt;August 9, 1993
&gt;
&gt;*** PLEASE WRITE, NOW!***      PLEASE, DON'T STOP NOW!
&gt;
&gt;  Assembly Bill 1624, mandating online public access to public legislative 
&gt;information via the public networks (i.e., the Internet and all the nets 
&gt;connected to it - including wherever you are receiving this msg), will either 
&gt;pass the Legislature by Sept. 10th, or will die - and we have to re-fight the 
&gt;whole battle, year after year.
&gt;  LETTERS &amp; FAXES ARE *NEEDED*!.  THEY *WILL* DETERMINE THE OUTCOME.
&gt;
&gt;REMAINING 1993 LEGISLATION SCHEDULE
&gt;  Jul 16th, the Legislature went into remission - uh, recess.
&gt;  Aug 16th, the Legislature reconvenes to diddle remaining 1993 business.
&gt;  Sep 10th, the Legislature quits working in Sacramento for the year.
&gt;  Oct 10th, the Governor must veto legislatively-approved bills he opposes.
&gt;On AUGUST 18TH, the Senate Rules Committee run by Sen. Dave Roberti 
&gt;(D-Van Nuys area) will hear AB1624.  If Roberti doesn't like it, he can and 
&gt;will kill it.   If Roberti passes it, it will almost-certainly pass the 
&gt;Senate. Then we need for the Assembly to "concur in amendments" and the 
&gt;Governor to not veto it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Address letters/faxes to "State Capitol, Sacremanto CA 95814."
&gt;
&gt;AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, send a one-page letter supporting AB1624 to the 
&gt;Senate Rules Committee - who have seen essentially *no* support for it:
&gt;Sen. David Roberti, Chair, Room 400; fax/916-323-7224; voice/916-445-8390.
&gt; and to the other four members (tiny, *powerful* committee!):
&gt;Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino area), Room 5108; f/916-445-0128; v/916-445-6868.
&gt;Sen. Robert Beverly (R-Long Bch), Room 5082; f/not avail.; v/916-445-6447.
&gt;Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside), Room 3070; f/not avail.; v/916-445-3731.
&gt;Sen. Nick Petris (D-Alameda), Room 5080; fax/916-327-1997; v/916-445-6577.
&gt;
&gt;Important:  Please send COPIES of ALL letters to the AB1624 author:
&gt;Hon. Debra Bowen, Room 3126; voice/916-445-8528; fax/916-327-2201.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;CAN EMAIL VIA ME, IF YA CAN'T FIND TIME FOR SNAIL-MAIL
&gt;  If you don't have time to send snail-mail, you can email your message via 
&gt;jwarren@well.sf.ca.us.
&gt;  Write it exactly as you would snail-mail, but be SURE TO INCLUDE your name, 
&gt;address and phone #s for legislators' independent verification.  Upon receipt 
&gt;by email, I will print and/or fax the entire message to Bowen and to the 
&gt;legislator(s) to whom you address it.  (Please allow for that delay.)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;LEGI-TECH'S OLDER BROTHER DONE GOOD!
&gt;  The McClatchy organization is the owner of Legi-Tech, one of the two 
&gt;largest online distributors of California legislative information.  They are 
&gt;also owner of a number of newspapers - their flagship being the powerful 
&gt;Sacramento Bee.
&gt;  On Jul 26th, the Bee ran an editorial *strongly* supportive of AB1624 - 
&gt;laudible, principled action by The Bee, McClatchy, and presumably by 
&gt;Legi-Tech in the face of a difficult trade-off between the public's 
&gt;interests versus their business interests.
&gt;  Applause!  Applause!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;CALIFORNIA LEGISPEAK: "AUTHOR" VS. "SPONSOR" VS. "SUPPORTER"
&gt;  In California legislative circles:
&gt;A bill's AUTHOR is a legislator who introduced the bill.
&gt;A bill's SPONSOR(S) is a person or organization, if any, that requested that 
&gt;the bill be introduced by the bill's author.
&gt;A bill's SUPPORTER(S) is a person or organization that is officially listed 
&gt;as being in favor of the bill, usually including its sponsor(s), if any.
&gt;  All bills have one or more authors.  Some bills do NOT have sponsors.
&gt;  AB1624's author was Assembly Member Debra Bowen.  It had no sponsors, but 
&gt;has a growing number of supporters.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;PROGRAMMERS:  SAMPLE LEGISLATIVE DATA-FILES ALSO AVAILABLE AT CPSR.ORG
&gt;  AB1624 Update #19 detailed a set of sample data-files for review and 
&gt;test-programming, available from Tim Pozar's KUMR.LNS.COM by anonymous ftp.
&gt;  As of Jul 22nd, those Legislative Data Center sample files were/are also 
&gt;online at cpsr.org in  /ftp/cpsr/states/california/ab1624/sample_data  
&gt;for binary ftp access.  For questions about accessing them there, contact:
