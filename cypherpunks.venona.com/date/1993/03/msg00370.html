 Forwarded from news.admin.policy where this individual is threatning to
set up a cancel message generating script to kill all posts from Julf's
Anon Service.

&gt;Hi David,
&gt;
&gt;    I hope you don't mind my changing the title of this thread... I
&gt;didn't care for the one you were using:
&gt;Re: Threat of mass cancellings was Re: Anonymity is NOT the issue
&gt;
&gt;     Tisk, tisk... you make it sound as if masses of postings are
&gt;threatened.  Have you *looked* for anonymous postings in the "sci"
&gt;hierarchy?  There are really very few.  Only two, for Friday:
&gt;&lt;1993Mar12.010241.2849@fuug.fi&gt;
&gt;&lt;1993Mar12.061727.9451@fuug.fi&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     The best time to put out a fire is while it is still small.  :-)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I presume that cancel messages can be cancelled ... though I haven't
&gt;&gt;experimented with this yet, but it looks like I might have to. In fact I
&gt;&gt;think I will probably just turn off response to cancel messages totally if
&gt;&gt;you go ahead with this scheme, and I encourage other news administrators
&gt;&gt;to do the same ... they were a bad kludge in the first place and still are.
&gt;&gt;It seems to me they are rarely used for other than controversial purposes
&gt;&gt;like you are proposing (I don't like other people's postings so I won't let
&gt;&gt;anyone else read them).
&gt;
&gt;     That (disabling cancel messages) would be unfortunate.  They have
&gt;many legitimate uses.  Cancelling inappropriate postings is one of
&gt;these legitimate uses.  Controversial, sure, but my reason for
&gt;activating the Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation script, if
&gt;Julf remains unwilling to accept any compromise, is simply to
&gt;demonstrate that the status quo with regards to anonymous postings from
&gt;a particular site *can* be effectively enforced.  As I have said many
&gt;times before, I do *not* object to anonymous postings in newsgroups
&gt;that invite them.  However, I think it *is* important to demonstrate
&gt;that USENET *does* have a defense against a self-styled cyberpunk
&gt;who refuses to cooperate with the rest of the net.  Whether USENET can
&gt;find the *will* to oppose him remains an open question.  I simply
&gt;intend a brief demonstration of one defense mechanism.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I really think you are getting carried away with a non-issue here, and
&gt;&gt;inflamming the situation is going to make you extremely unpopular, and
&gt;&gt;undoubtedly start a "cancelling war" at the very least.
&gt;
&gt;    The issue of an irresponsible system administrator trying to
&gt;impose his anonymous server on readers of thousands of newsgroups is
&gt;not a trivial one.  My proposal to restore the status quo in a
&gt;hierarchy that has protested anonymous postings may not make me
&gt;popular with anonymous posters, but I haven't seen a single message
&gt;claiming that any sci newsgroup has invited anonymous postings.  If
&gt;there is to be a "cancelling war", it will be very brief.  If I
&gt;activate the ARMM script, it will only be for the weekend.
&gt;     
&gt;&gt;No-one has appointed you as the moderator of all the non-alt groups
&gt;&gt;retrospectively or otherwise, and no-one is likely to appoint anyone else
&gt;&gt;in such a position either.
&gt;
&gt;    You are right, no one has appointed me to the post of
&gt;minimal-moderator.  It is a volunteer position with, I assure you,
&gt;miserable fringe benefits.  I will gladly relinquish the position when
&gt;the opportunity arises.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;&gt;&gt; There shouldn't be much controversy over this, but there will be
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyhow.  :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;There should be and there will be ... you are way out of line here Richard,
&gt;&gt;regardless of how many smileys you tack on the end of your message.
&gt;
&gt;     No.  It is Julf who is way out of line here... and has been for
&gt;four months, now.  He has finally met someone who has gotten fed up
&gt;with his silly game, and is willing to call his bluff.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I hope you are prepared to take responsibility for what is going to happen
&gt;&gt;to your institution's news and mail servers if you go ahead with this plan.
&gt;
&gt;     I hope you didn't mean that the way it reads... as a threat.  I
&gt;thought you were more responsible than that.  Perhaps I am wrong.  You
&gt;*have* been one of Julf's strongest supporters in this newsgroup,
&gt;urging him to ignore the advice of the experienced news administrators
&gt;in this group.  To date, this has been an argument between, if not
&gt;friends, then at least respected opponents.  Most of us have the best
&gt;interests of the net in mind, agree that anonymous postings have their
&gt;place, and agree that cooperative anarchy is a wonderful experiment.
&gt;You may not like my "Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation" script,
&gt;but you must at least admit that it is simply an automated version of
&gt;moderation - a well-accepted practice in newsgroups that want to keep
&gt;an acceptable signal/noise ratio.  You may protest that I have
&gt;bypassed the usual mechanisms for establishing moderation, and you
&gt;would be right.  I have brused some USENET traditions while trying to
&gt;protect others.  However, threats against the integrity of internet
&gt;sites are a far more serious matter.  I sent a long note to the
&gt;system administrators of my feed site, explaining my proposal and
&gt;pointing out some of the threats that might affect them.  We then
&gt;had a long talk.  They were, as you might expect, less than thrilled
&gt;at my rash proposal, which received a decidedly mixed reception.  They
&gt;were even less thrilled at the prospect of being the recipient of
&gt;denial-of service attacks.  They will take any such attacks seriously,
&gt;indeed.
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;&gt;I am sure you don't want to become Usenet's next "J Palmer" in terms of
&gt;&gt;reputation. (This is reference is becoming a bit like the "who is John Galt ?")
&gt;
&gt;   Glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Dick
