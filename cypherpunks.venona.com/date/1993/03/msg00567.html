Thanks to Greg Broiles for the information on UUNET.  I ftp'd some
info from ftp.uu.net as he suggested.  Here is an edited version of
one of their main info files.  I have left in the part relevant to
UUCP connections.

I would comment that this looks like it would not be an economical
approach for providing an anonymous posting service.  The volume
experienced by these services has been very high.  Greg indicates
that he gets about 700 chars per second for his link.  Any posting
or remailing request is going to have to be transmitted twice (once
in, once out).  At $2.47 per connect-hour we're talking about $2.00
per megabyte posted or remailed.  I believe Julf has seen several
megabytes per day.  So this volume will push the bill up to the range
of hundreds of dollars a month.  This is pretty expensive just to
support truth, justice and the American way on the net.  (This could
be reduced if large messages were filtered, but I don't know if UUCP
allows for a way to filter incoming messages so you don't get billed
for them.  After a while, though, if people learned that large messages
don't get remailed, they might stop sending them.  OTOH, the operator
of this service would be vulnerable to mail bombs by those opposed;
the bombs would land right in his wallet.)

Info from UUNET, edited, follows below.
