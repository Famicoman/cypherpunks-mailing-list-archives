You probably have seen this already, but it's certainly of relevance

&gt; Subject: Anon.penet.fi no more
&gt; Organization: No!
&gt; Date: Tue, 23 Mar 1993 15:03:59 GMT
&gt; Message-ID: &lt;1993Mar23.150359.16883@penet.fi&gt;
&gt; Lines: 54
&gt; 

&gt; The anonymous service at anon.penet.fi has been closed down.  
Postings to
&gt; netnews and mail to arbitrary addresses has been blocked. To enable  
users
&gt; who know each other only by their anon ID's to arrange alternate
&gt; communication paths, mail to anonymous users will still be  
supported for
&gt; two weeks. After this period all database entries will be deleted.
&gt; 

&gt; Due to the lawsuit-intensive climate in the US, many anonymous  
services have
&gt; been short-lived. By setting up anon.penet.fi in Finland, I hoped  
to create
&gt; a more stable service. Anon.penet.fi managed to stay in operation  
for almost
&gt; five months. The service was protected from most of the usual  
problems that
&gt; had forced other services to shut down. But there are always going  
to be
&gt; ways to stop something as controversial as an anon service. In this  
case, a
&gt; very well-known and extremely highly regarded net personality  
managed to
&gt; contact exactly the right people to create a situation where it is
&gt; politically impossible for me to continue running the service.
&gt; 

&gt; But of course this political situation is mainly caused by the  
abuse of the
&gt; network that a very small minority of anon users engaged in. This  
small
&gt; group of immature and thoughtless individuals (mainly users from US
&gt; universities) caused much aggravation and negative feelings towards  
the
&gt; service. This is especially unfortunate considering these people  
really are
&gt; a minuscule minority of anon users. The latest statistics from the  
service
&gt; show 18203 registered users, 3500 messages per day on the average,  
and
&gt; postings to 576 newsgroups. Of these users, I have received  
complaints
&gt; involving postings from 57 anonymous users, and, of these, been  
forced to
&gt; block only 8 users who continued their abuse despite a warning from  
me.
&gt; 

&gt; In retrospect I realize that I have been guilty to keeping a far  
too low
&gt; profile on the network, prefering to deal with the abuse cases  
privately
&gt; instead of making strong public statements. Unfortunately I  
realized this
&gt; only a couple of days before being forced to shut down the service,  
but the
&gt; results of a single posting to alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.d gave  
very
&gt; positive results. I take full blaim for my failure to realize the
&gt; psychological effects of a strongly stated, publicly visible  
display of
&gt; policy with regards to the abuse cases. For this I have to  
apologize to the
&gt; whole net community.
&gt; 

&gt; On the other hand I am deeply concerned by the fact that the  
strongest
&gt; opposition to the service didn't come from users but from network
&gt; administrators. I don't think sysadmins have a god-given mandate to
&gt; dictate what's good for the users and what's not. A lot of users  
have
&gt; contacted me to thank me for the service, describing situations  
where
&gt; anonymity has been crucial, but I could never have imagined in my  
wildest
&gt; dreams. At the same time quite a few network administrators have  
made
&gt; comments like "I can't imagine any valid use for anonymity on the  
net" and
&gt; "The only use for anonymity is to harrass and terrorize the net".
&gt; 

&gt; Nevertheless, I really want to apologize both to all the users on  
the
&gt; network who have suffered from the abusive misuse of the server,  
and to all
&gt; the users who have come to rely on the service. Again, I take full
&gt; responsibility for what has happened.

Very sad, rather scary.  Sorry to hear this, Julf.
