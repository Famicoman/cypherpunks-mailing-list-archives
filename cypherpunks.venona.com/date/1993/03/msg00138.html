In message &lt;<A HREF="msg00107.html">m0nTiSl-0001y6C@rmsdell.ftl.fl.us</A>&gt; you write:
&gt; &gt; is problem: break the current list into topic areas.
&gt; 
&gt; A similar situation occurred a while ago on the Extropians list.  Many
&gt; people were complaining about excess volume, people were
&gt; unsubscribing, and there was talk of splitting the list into many
&gt; sublists.  There are some problems with sublists.  Many people would
&gt; subscribe to all the lists, or many of them.  List management chores
&gt; ((un)subscriptions, bounces, address changes, etc) would increase.
&gt; Many messages would get "cross-posted" to several or all lists, and
&gt; thus would appear many times in everyone's mail box, thus even
&gt; increasing the number of messages to sift through.  There are other
&gt; problems, which I will not mention now.
&gt; 
&gt; I proposed a simple solution which is in use now, and has greatly
&gt; increased the quality of the list, makes it easy for everyone to only
&gt; read the messages they want, and does not require deployment of any
&gt; new software.  The actual volume has not decreased, probably it even
&gt; increased.  But the information flow is so much more manageable.
&gt; 
&gt; The solution is the use of prefixes in Subject: lines.  When you post,
&gt; prefix your Subject: line with a short "tag" such as "ANON:",
&gt; "DCNET:", "PGP:", "DCASH:", or others.  For example, you would see
&gt; subjects like
&gt; 
&gt; PGP: new version available
&gt; ANON: an new idea for anonymous replies
&gt; 
&gt; etcetera.  When reading your mail, just have your mailer sort the mail
&gt; by Subject: line (if your mailer can't do that, get a new mailer), and
&gt; all messages about PGP will come together, all messages about
&gt; anonymous remailers will be in one area, etc.  Then it's easy to
&gt; delete them all without reading, to save them to a file for future
&gt; reference, or to read them if that is a topic you are interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; The beauty of this system is it's anarchistic nature.  There is no
&gt; need for people to maintain an official list of prefixes, or to vote
&gt; on new ones (as is done with newsgroups), or to ask someone to create
&gt; one (as would be necessary for mailing sublists).  There's no need for
&gt; the group as a whole to agree on anything.  Just start using them.
&gt; Try to find a logical prefix for each message that matches its subject
&gt; area.
&gt; 
&gt; Most likely people posting on the same topic will choose same or similar
&gt; prefix.  After some initial fluctuation, different prefixes for the same
&gt; topic will converge to one that will become customary for that topic.
&gt; 
&gt; New prefixes will pop up every once in a while, and the ones not used
&gt; will fade from the group memory.  This is a flexible, dynamic system.
&gt; 
&gt; As a starting point I will make up a prefix for each of the sublists 
&gt; you proposed (if you don't like my prefix, use a different one!):
&gt; 
&gt;    ANON:    anon/pseudo_cpunks   Anoymity/Pseudonymity
&gt;    REMAIL:  remailers_cpunks     Remailer Technology
&gt;    DCNET:   dining_cpunks        DC Nets
&gt;    RANDOM:  random-cpunks        Random Generators
&gt;    DCASH:   digimoney_cpunks     Digital Banking
&gt;    PGP:     pgp_cpunks           PGP App/Current Info 
&gt;    FLAME:-) ziplips_cpunks       Crypto-Censorship
&gt;    WHISTLE: fweee_cpunks         Whistleblowers (The "Keith Peterson Area"?)
&gt;    MEET:    physmtgs_cpunks      Physical Meetings/Conferences  
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some more:  META: discussions on the list about the list
&gt; itself, such as this post, or the post I am replying to which suggested
&gt; splitting the list.  Complaints about high volume, messages saying something
&gt; does or does not belong on the list, etc, would use this prefix.
&gt; 
&gt; ANNOUNCE: important messages that everyone may be interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; FRIV: for jokes, parodies, other frivolous posts.
&gt; 
&gt; If a post fits in more than one subject area, the main prefix should
&gt; be put first, for sorting purposes.  The other prefix(es) would follow,
&gt; separated by slashes.  For example "PGP/ANNOUNCE: new version available"
&gt; or "RANDOM/FRIV: why not just flip coins?".  This is in no way mandatory,
&gt; it's just a convention that developed on Extropians, and it may be
&gt; advantageous to use it, to ease further processing.
&gt; 
&gt; Some other ideas:
&gt; 
&gt; You can use procmail, elm filter, slocal, or any other mail processing
&gt; tool to handle messages with different prefixes.
&gt; 
&gt; For example if you are a very busy person, or are reading your mail
&gt; over a low-speed link, you may want to save all REMAIL/ANNOUNCE
&gt; messages in a "remailers" file, delete all FRIV, META, and FLAME
&gt; messages, and for each other prefix, save the message to an
&gt; appropriate folder for reading later.
&gt; 
&gt; If you were not interested in discussion, but wanted to keep up 
&gt; on what's going on, you would have the filter delete all the messages
&gt; from the mailin list that do not have an ANNOUNCE: prefix.
&gt; 
&gt; Or, if you have enough time and/or are using a high-speed connection,
&gt; you may just sort all the messages by Subject: thereby lumping all the 
&gt; messages on a subject together.  Then you can decide which you are going
&gt; to read first, which ones you want to delete, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; If this idea takes off, and most people will start using prefixes, further
&gt; evolution of the concept is possible.  For example a group of extropians
&gt; are developing some software on the list host machine that will let people
&gt; customise their subscription, for example choosing not to receive messages
&gt; with a certain prefix, not to receive messages that don't have a prefix,
&gt; or choosing to receive only some selected prefixes, plus any new prefixes
&gt; that come to use.
&gt; 
&gt; All this is sometime in the future.  Right now, let's start by just
&gt; prefixing each subject line with an appropriate prefix.

I fully support this call for prefixes by subject class.
