&gt;Subject: ANON/ANNOUNCE: Sysadmin Policies at Universities (and high schools)
&gt;To: babani@cs.Buffalo.EDU (Rusty Babani)

&gt;&gt;This message came to me immidatly after I requested the sysadmin here
&gt;&gt;at UB to upgrade to PGP to version 2.1 Do I need to explain this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Notes:       given the questionable legal status of the PGP software
&gt;&gt;		it has been removed from UCS supported areas.  people
&gt;&gt;		interested in authentication/privacy should use ripem.

&gt;     It sounds like someone needs to take a stand against the UCS policies
&gt;at Buffalo or else they are going to go farther and farther...  Trust me,
&gt;that is happening on this campus too.  I used to go to high school here

[nice story about sudents and privacy deleted]

&gt;     If you want to let Buffalo take a turn for the worse as far as
&gt;policy goes, then don't say anything about their decisions.  I would
...
&gt;I have for you are:  how do you get an account on their system?  If

They haven't changed their policy since 1988.  That was when it was
created and that is the same policy I had to sign to get an account
one and a half years ago.

VAX accounts and unix accounts on the time-share hosts are pretty much
given to anyone who asks for one.  Both these systems are very slow
due to the high load in the daytime.

Unix accounts on the special CS machines are only given to those who
can prove they are in a CS related major.  (I have all three types of
accounts.)


&gt;NONviolently oppose whatever you think is not right.  The questions

I was doing this by running the remailer... However, they caught up
with me.

&gt;I would have friends complain for you.  :) Do it anonymously
&gt;through a remailer... No matter what, if you are passive, you'll lose.  

They seem to stand behind their policies and have even given me
reasons as to why the policies are such.  Here is the responce I got
as to WHY I CANT RUN A REMAILER IN MY ACCOUNT...

-------Begin Quote-------
It has always been our policy that your accounts may only be used by
you. Without such a policy, illegal and untracable actions may take
place and these in turn put the University at serious legal risk. By
installing such a mailer you are giving limited use of your account
to the entire world.
--------End Quote--------

Then he went on to say something to the effect of having an account
is not a right but a privilage, etc.

I think complaining would only hurt me right now.  Even if I complain
"Anonymously" I think they would be able to figure out who was behind
the complaints.  If I mailed a message form my account to them, they
could easily trace it back to me if they wanted to... I would have to
find another account on a machine not connected directly to UB to
complain from.  Of course, I would have to go the encrypted my
messages to the anonymous remailers... all the way, and make it at
MINIMUM a double hop message.  It's possible.  But is it worth the
work especially since they seem pretty content with the policy the way
it is?
