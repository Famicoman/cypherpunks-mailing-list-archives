Well... This is available from our site via anonymous FTP... so I suppose
there are no copyright problems by sending it to you...  enjoy...

OBTW, the title lines are my addition...  and the file is normally printed
(on the sheet they give you with your initial password) in small print,
and so the file is formatted to about 132 columns...

&gt; Following the thread about some Universities policy about using
&gt; computing services I'd like to ask if you can send me YOUR

&gt; compilation of them and put it on our ftp server (smup7.jussieu.fr).
&gt;
