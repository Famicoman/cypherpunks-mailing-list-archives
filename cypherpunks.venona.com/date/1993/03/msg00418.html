&gt; George pointed out what I pointed out earlier - sending the latest
&gt; Michael Jackson tune over the net might raise eyebrows as well as
&gt; copyright violations. Being from the 'grunge town' of Seattle, it was

Besides, Michael Jackson sucks! ;^)

&gt; discussed that perhaps it would be possible to send a copy of some
&gt; 'unknown' band over the net without harm. In fact, perhaps this is a
&gt; good place to start: the underground music scene.

I assume you mean with their permission.  Think of it, you tell a band that you want to distribute one of their demo's around the world.  I think they'd buy it.
And I don't think they'd care that you embedded a message in it, either.  And a
lot of cypherpunks like underground music.  Works for all of us.  I like this 
idea and think it could work.

&gt; gg - "This week on Music By Wire, a new song by the Subversives,
&gt; recorded at Pretty Good Productions. . ."

I love it! Pretty Good Productions...  That's the best. ;^)

&gt; Next, discussion turned to the integration of modem carrier tones as
&gt; samples in music (rap). If this new twist caught on, the artist could
&gt; encode messages (in plaintext, or later ciphertext) into the song,

I don't know, will a modem weed out all of the noise to get to the carrier
tones that we embedded in the crap...er...I mean rap music. ;^)

&gt; including the key on the record insert. What does this do for us? By
&gt; using ciphertext "... as an artistic product, ..[we] thereby gain
&gt; another layer of 1st Amendment protection." Free speech.

Nice!
&gt;  
&gt; Lastly and perhaps most interesting: I suggested that by using one of
&gt; these garage bands, we might be able to distribute our own messages
&gt; on CD. By getting ahold of a local bands' master before they take it
&gt; to get a record pressed, we could digitize it ourselves, encode our
&gt; messages (the kama sutra, a message of goodwill, the songs' lyrics,
&gt; whatever the band wants, too!) into the LSBs and then give it back to
&gt; the band to press CDs (put the key on the front cover if you like).

I wonder if a PC will read the data that comprises a CD data-set.  My
consern is about directory structure etc.

&gt; The band could be told that not only were they certain to sell ~100
&gt; CDs (@ $12-$14 each = $1,300 -- no small sum for a garage band) just
&gt; to cypherpunk members, but they would also be "the first band in
&gt; history to digitally encode messages into their music... etc."

Kind of a new twist on backward subliminal messages, eh? ;^)

&gt; I don't think the ~100 CDs is an understatement, either. How many
&gt; cypherpunks do we have nowadays? I would be willing to shell over
&gt; $15 for a (basically) small-capacity encrypted CD ROM disk, even
&gt; though I personally don't have a player.

We could distribute the needed source code on an underground basis.
We could distribute whole software packages piggy-backing on a garage 
band's demo!  Bitchen!
&gt;  
&gt; gg and myself are both rather interested in this last idea --
&gt; tweaking with a bands' CD before it gets pressed. Does it
&gt; sound promising to anyone else?

Most definately!
