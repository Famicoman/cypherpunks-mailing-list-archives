&gt;     As I promised yesterday, I emailed each recent anonomous poster
&gt;in the "sci" hierarchy a note explaining what may happen this
&gt;weekend.  
&gt;
&gt;Dick
&gt;=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
&gt;Dear anonymous poster,
&gt;
&gt;     You may not be aware of the discussion in news.admin.policy
&gt;concerning the propriety of posting anonymously to newsgroups which
&gt;have not invited such postings.  As someone who has posted anonymously
&gt;to the "sci" hierarchy recently, you should read it.
&gt;
&gt;     I am writing to inform you that if Julf, admin@anon.penet.fi,
&gt;does not soon block anonymous postings to the "sci" hierarchy, then
&gt;I will activate an "Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation" script
&gt;that will cancel postings to this hierarchy from his server.  This is
&gt;intended to restore the pre-Julf status quo, at least temporarily,
&gt;over the weekend.
&gt;
&gt;     Rest assured that there is nothing personal in this.  I have not
&gt;read your postings, and I have no reason to believe that they were out
&gt;of line in any way other than being anonymous.  I have nothing against
&gt;anonymous postings to groups that have decided to accept such
&gt;postings, nor do I object to any newsgroup deciding to do this.  I
&gt;*do* object to Julf's permitting his server to post to newsgroups
&gt;without any effort to determine whether the readers of those newsgroups
&gt;want to permit anonymous postings.
&gt;
&gt;     You have several possible courses of action if you wish to post
&gt;to the "sci" hierarchy while the "Automated Retroactive Minimal
&gt;Moderation" is in effect:
&gt;
&gt;*1  convince Julf to accept the "Petersen Proposal" for default
&gt;    settings for different hierarchies.  I promise to turn off the
&gt;    ARMM script as soon as I hear that he will do this (or anything
&gt;    reasonably responsive).
&gt;
&gt;*2  convince the readers of the newsgroup to which you want to post
&gt;    that anonymous postings should be accepted in that newsgroup.
&gt;    I can think of several valid reasons that may prompt such a desire,
&gt;    but the decision should be made by the readers of the newsgroup, not
&gt;    imposed by a single person such as Julf, or me.  I promise to
&gt;    abide by whatever decision the newsgroup makes.  This does not
&gt;    need to be a formal vote.  A straw vote with a clear majority will
&gt;    suffice.
&gt;
&gt;*3  have a friend post for you, use a different anonymous server,
&gt;    or, if all else fails, post under your own name.  People used to
&gt;    do this, you know.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;    If none of these suit you, then simply be patient, and wait until
&gt;Monday.  I intend to run ARMM, if I run it at all, for less than 48
&gt;hours... this time.  This is merely intended to be a demonstration
&gt;that an effective enforcement mechanism for blocking postings from a
&gt;particular site can work.
&gt;
&gt;    I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you.
&gt;My argument is with Julf and is about the default setting for entire
&gt;hierarchies; it is not with you or your particular postings.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Dick Depew
