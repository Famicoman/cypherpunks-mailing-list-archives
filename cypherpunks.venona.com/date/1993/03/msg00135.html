(Sorry, Cypherpunks, for the "&gt;" in this message--I made the classic
mistake of sending this message only to Fen, hence this forwarded form.
I'll try to watch this in the future!)

&gt;Fen Labalme believes Eric's "penny a hop" is still too expensive, especially
&gt;for "the poor":
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Geeez, Eric!  I'd think a penny a hop would be a pretty high price...  And
&gt;&gt;given that most messages go through two hops, then you'd really be giving
&gt;&gt;your 2 cents worth!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Note that there can be about 50 cypherpunks messages a day -- if each went
&gt;&gt;through 2 hops at $0.10 / hop, as you proposed, that would be $10 / day in
&gt;&gt;revenues for the remailers.  Seems like a lot to me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I would support the idea if I felt that the system would quiet the flame
&gt;&gt;wars, but I think rather it would simply quiet the poor...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Fen
&gt;
&gt;You don't have to support the idea, Fen, you just have to open your own
&gt;remailing node! If you think you can do it more cheaply--perhaps subsidizing
&gt;the costs from your other income, or perhaps just doing it as charity--you are
&gt;completely free to do so.
&gt;
&gt;The "liquidity" of remailer hops (with the "Mark V" software that handles the
&gt;grunge automatically) will be quite interesting to see. Some will go for
&gt;minimum cost (one cheap hop), others will route messages through dozens of
&gt;hops. 
&gt;
&gt;Services will arise which "rate" the quality of remailers, in terms of
&gt;pricing, security, latency, message sizes accepted, past experiences, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Bandwidths are increasing so rapidly and computer hardware is getting so
&gt;cheap, that I doubt even the poorest of the poor, in the U.S. at least, will
&gt;be unable to send these kinds of messages. The costs of transmission are just
&gt;so trivial compared to other costs that even poor people routinely pay.
&gt;
&gt;(Whether the poor and downtrodden will _want_ to participate in this Brave New
&gt;World is another matter. My guess is they will.)
&gt;
