&gt;Please explain to me, lefty, why you insist on flaming someone who simply 
&gt;wants to unsubscribe from the list.

Mr. Brennan, I wouldn't ever flame anyone who simply wanted to unsubscribe
from this list.  I _would_, however, certainly flame a fool with a
room-temperature IQ who feels that the best way of dealing with his _own_
_personal_ problem unsubscribing from the list is to send 80,000 bytes of
garbage to over two hundred people who couldn't do anything about his
problem even if they wanted to.  People who may, in fact, be paying good
money to receive electronic mail and who didn't have any particular need
for 3,600 copies of the words "Unsubscribe me!!!!"

&gt;This is truly beyond comprehension.

Given the apparent level of your comprehension, I'm not in the least
surprised.  I imagine this sort of thing must happen to you frequently,
say, whenever you're faced with a situation more complicated that deciding
whether you want fries with your Big Mac.

&gt;I had thought for a moment that the cypherpunks were rising above petty,
&gt;&gt;arrogant slanders, but evidently I was wrong.

I suggest you look up the word "slander" in the dictionary.  Get one of the
big kids to help you with it, if necessary, and if you can find one who
won't beat you up on sight.

It doesn't mean what you apparently believe it does.

&gt;Clearly uri and lefty wish to drag this whole affair down to new depths. And 
&gt;why? Just to prove to everyone that you can insert your head up your ass
&gt;&gt;further than anyone can imagine?
&gt;
&gt;You are truly pathetic.

Gosh, Mr. Brennan, those are pretty strong words for a fellow who cries
"slander" at the apparent drop of a hat.  If you keep this sort of thing
up, you're liable to convince me that you're not only an idiot but a
hypocrite as well.

Somebody's got his head up his ass here, but I suspect it's not me, Chucko.
