ECFP '93:
The First European Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy

The New Cavendish Club
London, England

20th November 1993


Organised by ECFP Ventures Limited

Co-operating organisations :
  The Libertarian Alliance
  Privacy International, UK
  UK Cryptoprivacy Association


SCOPE
- ----------------------------------

The widespread use of computers and 
communication systems has brought considerable 
benefits to our business and personal lives and will 
continue to change and shape the way in which we 
live. However, with those benefits come unprecedented 
threats to our personal privacy and potential for abuse.

A variety of different models for protection of 
individual privacy in the electronic age have been 
suggested, ranging from state regulation to individual 
action through the use of strong cryptography. 
However, these solutions bring with them their own 
class of problems, including excessive state 
involvement in private matters and the frustration of 
law enforcement and national security objectives.

The First European Conference on Computers, 
Freedom and Privacy will both provide an introduction 
to these issues and the technological developments 
that drive them, and examine different ways in which 
individual rights can be guaranteed. These questions
are central to the preservation of a free society in the 
Information Age.

John M. Brimacombe
Conference Chair
