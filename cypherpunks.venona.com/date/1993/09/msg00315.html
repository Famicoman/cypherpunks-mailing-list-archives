&gt;I am searching for two out-of-print books. I would like to purchase one
&gt;copy each in reasonably good condition. If you have either and are willing
&gt;to part with it, please contact me by email. Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;Tutorial: The Security of Data in Networks
&gt;by Davies
&gt;IEEE Computer Society Press, 1981
&gt;
&gt;Kahn on Codes
&gt;by Kahn
&gt;Macmillan, 1983
&gt;
&gt;Note: the second book is NOT "The Codebreakers" but a later book by Kahn.
 
        I tried e-mail but the message is bouncing around like a
        kangaroo on certain controlled substances.  The following is
        a list of bookstores dealing, more or less specifically with
        espionage and intelligence and include some coverage of
        crypto.  My recommendation for the first title would be
        to try Elm.  If you contact C&amp;D, ELM, or NIBC, mentioning
        my name _might_ help.
