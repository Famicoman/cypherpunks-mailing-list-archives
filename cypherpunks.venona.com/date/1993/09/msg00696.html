&gt;
&gt;The following article on wiretap laws and procedures was written in
&gt;response to the many questions and misunderstandings that have arisen
&gt;in the context of escrowed encryption as well as Digital Telephony.  I
&gt;would appreciate it if you would send it out through the eff-news
&gt;mailing list and archive it in your database of papers.

&gt;                                     
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1.  Introduction
&gt;
&gt;Although wiretaps are generally illegal in the United States, the
&gt;federal government and the governments of thirty seven states have been
&gt;authorized through federal and state legislation to intercept wire and
&gt;electronic communications under certain stringent rules which include
&gt;obtaining a court order.  These rules have been designed to ensure the
&gt;protection of individual privacy and Fourth Amendment rights, while
&gt;permitting the use of wiretaps for investigations of serious criminal
&gt;activity and for foreign intelligence.
&gt;
&gt;This article describes the legal requirements for government
&gt;interceptions of wire and electronic communications and some of the
&gt;additional procedures and practices followed by federal and state
&gt;agencies.  The legal requirements are rooted in two pieces of federal
&gt;legislation: the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (Title III
&gt;of the Act (hereafter "Title III")), passed in 1968, and the Foreign
&gt;Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), passed in 1978.  Title III
&gt;established the basic law for federal and state law enforcement
&gt;interceptions performed for the purpose of criminal investigations,
&gt;while FISA established the law for federal-level interceptions
&gt;performed for intelligence and counterintelligence operations.  We will
&gt;first describe Title III interceptions and then describe FISA
&gt;interceptions.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2.  Title III Interceptions
&gt;
&gt;Title III, as amended (particularly by the Electronic Communications
&gt;Privacy Act of 1986), is codified at Title 18 USC, Sections 2510-2521.
&gt;These statutes provide privacy protection for and govern the
&gt;interception of oral, wire, and electronic communications.  Title III
&gt;covers all telephone communications regardless of the medium, except
&gt;that it does not cover the radio portion of a cordless telephone
&gt;communication that is transmitted between the handset and base unit.
&gt;The law authorizes the interception of oral, wire, and electronic
&gt;communications by investigative and law enforcement officers conducting
&gt;criminal investigations pertaining to serious criminal offenses, i.e.,
&gt;felonies, following the issuance of a court order by a judge.  The
&gt;Title III law authorizes the interception of particular criminal
&gt;communications related to particular criminal offenses.  In short, it
&gt;authorizes the acquisition of evidence of crime.  It does not authorize
&gt;noncriminal intelligence gathering, nor does it authorize interceptions
&gt;related to social or political views.
&gt;
&gt;Thirty seven states have statutes permitting interceptions by state and
&gt;local law enforcement officers for certain types of criminal
&gt;investigations.  All of the state statutes are based upon Title III
&gt;from which they are derivative.  These statutes must be at least as
&gt;restrictive as Title III, and in fact most are more restrictive in
&gt;their requirements.  In describing the legal requirements, we will
&gt;focus on those of Title III since they define the baseline for all
&gt;wiretaps performed by federal, state, and local law enforcement
&gt;agencies.
&gt;
&gt;In recent years, state statutes have been modified to keep pace with
&gt;rapid technological advances in telecommunications.  For example, New
&gt;Jersey amended its electronic surveillance statute in 1993 to include
&gt;cellular telephones, cordless telephones, digital display beepers, fax
&gt;transmissions, computer-to-computer communications, and traces obtained
&gt;through "caller-ID".
&gt;
&gt;Wiretaps are limited to the crimes specified in Title III and state
&gt;statutes.  In New Jersey, the list includes murder, kidnapping,
&gt;gambling, robbery, bribery, aggravated assault, wrongful credit
&gt;practices, terrorist threats, arson, burglary, felony thefts, escape,
&gt;forgery, narcotics trafficking, firearms trafficking, racketeering, and
&gt;organized crime.
&gt;
&gt;Most wiretaps are large undertakings, requiring a substantial use of
&gt;resources.  In 1992, the average cost of installing intercept devices
&gt;and monitoring communications was $46,492.  Despite budget constraints
&gt;and personnel shortages, law enforcement conducts wiretaps as
&gt;necessary, but obviously, because of staffing and costs, judiciously.
&gt;  
&gt;2.1  Application for a Court Order
&gt;
&gt;All government wiretaps require a court order based upon a detailed
&gt;showing of probable cause.  To obtain a court order, a three-step
&gt;process is involved.  First, the law enforcement officer responsible
&gt;for the investigation must draw up a detailed affidavit showing that
&gt;there is probable cause to believe that the target telephone is being
&gt;used to facilitate a specific, serious, indictable crime.
&gt;
&gt;Second, an attorney for the federal, state, or local government must
&gt;work with the law enforcement officer to prepare an application for a
&gt;court order, based upon the officer's affidavit.  At the federal level,
&gt;the application must be approved by the Attorney General, Deputy
&gt;Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, any Assistant Attorney
&gt;General, any acting Assistant Attorney General, or any Deputy Assistant
&gt;Attorney General in the Criminal Division designated by the Attorney
&gt;General.  At the state and local level, the application must be made
&gt;and approved by the principal prosecuting attorney of the state (State
&gt;Attorney General) or political subdivision thereof (District Attorney
&gt;or County Prosecutor).  The attorney must be authorized by a statute of
&gt;that state to make such applications.
&gt;
&gt;Third, the attorney must present the approved application ex parte
&gt;(without an adversary hearing) to a federal or state judge who is
&gt;authorized to issue a court order for electronic surveillance.  A state
&gt;or local police officer or federal law enforcement agent cannot make an
&gt;application for a court order directly to a judge.
&gt;
&gt;Typically, a court order is requested after a lengthy investigation and
&gt;the use of a "Dialed Number Recorder" (DNR).  The DNR is used to track
&gt;the outgoing calls from the suspect's phone in order to demonstrate
&gt;that the suspect is communicating with known criminals.
&gt;
&gt;Title III requires that an application for a court order specify:
&gt;
&gt;   (a) the investigative or law enforcement officer making the
&gt;       application and the high-level government attorney authorizing
&gt;       the application;
&gt;
&gt;   (b) the facts and circumstances of the case justifying the
&gt;       application, including details of the particular offense under
&gt;       investigation, the identity of the person committing it, the
&gt;       type of communications sought, and the nature and location of
&gt;       the communication facilities;
&gt;
&gt;   (c) whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried
&gt;       and failed or why they would likely fail or be too dangerous;
&gt;   
&gt;   (d) the period of time for the interception (at most 30 days -
&gt;       extensions may be permitted upon reapplication);
&gt;
&gt;   (e) the facts concerning all previous applications involving any of
&gt;       the same persons or facilities;
&gt;
&gt;   (f) where the application is for the extension of an order, the
&gt;       results thus far obtained from the interception.
&gt;
&gt;The process of making an application for a court order is further
&gt;restricted by internal procedures adopted by law enforcement agencies
&gt;to ensure that wiretaps conform to the laws and are used only when
&gt;justified.  The following describes the process for the FBI and the New
&gt;York State Police.
&gt;
&gt;2.1.1  FBI Applications
&gt;
&gt;In order for an FBI agent to conduct an interception, the agent must
&gt;follow procedures that go well beyond the legal requirements imposed by
&gt;Title III and which involve extensive internal review.  In preparing
&gt;the affidavit, the FBI agent in the field works with the field office
&gt;principal legal advisor and also with an attorney in the local U.S.
&gt;Attorney's Office, revising the documentation to take into account
&gt;their comments and suggestions.  After the documents are approved by
&gt;field office management, they are submitted to the Department of
&gt;Justice's Office of Enforcement Operations (OEO) in the Criminal
&gt;Division and to the FBI Headquarters (HQ).  At FBI HQ, the documents go
&gt;to the Legal Counsel Division (LCD) and the Criminal Investigative
&gt;Division (CID).  Within the CID, they are sent to the program manager
&gt;of the criminal program unit relating to the type of violation under
&gt;investigation, e.g., organized crime.  The program manager determines
&gt;whether the subjects of the proposed interception are worthy targets of
&gt;investigation and whether the interception is worth doing.  Attorneys
&gt;in the FBI's LCD and the DOJ's OEO further refine the documents.
&gt;
&gt;After the documents are approved by the DOJ's OEO and by FBI HQ, they
&gt;are referred to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General (or above), who
&gt;reviews the documents and signs off on them.  At this point, the DOJ
&gt;authorizes the local U.S. Attorney's Office to file the final version
&gt;of the documents (application, affidavit, court order, and service
&gt;provider order) in court.  The U.S. Attorney's Office then submits the
&gt;documents and the DOJ authorization to a federal judge.  The entire
&gt;process can take as long as a month.
&gt;
&gt;The following summarizes the people and organizations involved in the
&gt;preparation or approval of the application and the issuance of a court
&gt;order:
&gt;
&gt;   1.  FBI agent
&gt;   2.  FBI field office attorney (principal legal advisor)
&gt;   3.  FBI field office management
&gt;   4.  Attorney in local U.S. Attorney's office
&gt;   5.  DOJ Office of Enforcement Operations (OEO)
&gt;   6.  FBI HQ Legal Counsel Division (LCD)
&gt;   7.  FBI HQ Criminal Investigative Division (CID)
&gt;   8.  DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General (or higher)
&gt;   9.  Federal District Court judge
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2.1.2  New York State Police Applications
&gt;
&gt;Within the New York State Police, electronic surveillance is conducted
&gt;by Senior Investigators in the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI).  
&gt;In preparing an affidavit, the investigator works with the District
&gt;Attorney's Office (or, in the case of a federal investigation, the U.S.
&gt;Attorney's office) and with the BCI Captain of the investigator's
&gt;troop.  (Wiretap applications can be made and approved by the State
&gt;Attorney General, but this is unusual.)  The Captain assesses whether
&gt;review by Division Headquarters is necessary and confers with the
&gt;Assistant Deputy Superintendent (ADS) or Headquarters Captain for final
&gt;determination.  If Headquarters review is deemed necessary, then all
&gt;documentation is sent to the ADS along with a memorandum, endorsed by
&gt;the Troop Unit Supervisor and the Troop or Detail Commander, requesting
&gt;approval.  If Headquarters review is deemed unnecessary, then the memo
&gt;is sent without the documentation.  Once the ADS and District Attorney
&gt;(DA) approve the application, the DA submits the application to a judge
&gt;who grants or denies the court order.
&gt;
&gt;2.2  Issuance of a Court Order
&gt;
&gt;Not all judges have the authority to grant court orders for wiretaps.
&gt;In New Jersey, for example, only eight judges are designated as
&gt;"wiretap judges" for the entire state.  These judges are given special
&gt;training to be sensitive to personal rights of privacy and to recognize
&gt;the importance of telephone intercepts for law enforcement.
&gt;
&gt;Before a judge can approve an application for electronic surveillance
&gt;and issue a court order, the judge must determine that:
&gt;
&gt;   (a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is
&gt;       committing, has committed, or is about to commit an offense
&gt;       covered by the law;
&gt;
&gt;   (b) there is probable cause for belief that particular
&gt;       communications concerning that offense will be obtained through
&gt;       such interception;
&gt;
&gt;   (c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed
&gt;       or reasonably appear unlikely to succeed or to be too dangerous;
&gt;
&gt;   (d) there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from
&gt;       which, or the place where the communications are to be
&gt;       intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in
&gt;       connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased
&gt;       to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to showing probable cause, one of the main criterion for
&gt;determining whether a court order should be issued is whether normal
&gt;investigative techniques have been or are likely to be unsuccessful
&gt;(criterion (c) above).  Electronic surveillance is a tool of last
&gt;resort and cannot be used if other methods of investigation could
&gt;reasonably be used instead.  Such normal investigative methods usually
&gt;include visual surveillance, interviewing subjects, the use of
&gt;informers, telephone record analysis, and DNRs.  However, these
&gt;techniques often have limited impact on an investigation.  Continuous
&gt;surveillance by police can create suspicion and therefore be hazardous;
&gt;further, it cannot disclose the contents of telephone conversations.
&gt;Questioning identified suspects or executing search warrants at their
&gt;residence can substantially jeopardize an investigation before the full
&gt;scope of the operation is revealed, and information can be lost through
&gt;interpretation.  Informants are useful and sought out by police, but
&gt;the information they provide does not always reveal all of the players
&gt;or the extent of an operation, and great care must be taken to ensure
&gt;that the informants are protected.  Moreover, because informants are
&gt;often criminals themselves, they may not be believed in court.
&gt;Telephone record analysis and DNRs are helpful, but do not reveal the
&gt;contents of conversations or the identities of parties.  Other methods
&gt;of investigation that may be tried include undercover operations and
&gt;stings.  But while effective in some cases, undercover operations are
&gt;difficult and dangerous, and stings do not always work. 
&gt;
&gt;If the judge approves the application, then a court order is issued
&gt;specifying the relevant information given in the application, namely,
&gt;the identity of the person (if known) whose communications are to be
&gt;intercepted, the nature and location of the communication facilities,
&gt;the type of communication to be intercepted and the offense to which it
&gt;relates, the agency authorized to perform the interception and the
&gt;person authorizing the application, and the period of time during which
&gt;such interception is authorized.  A court order may also require that
&gt;interim status reports be made to the issuing judge while the wiretap
&gt;is in progress.
&gt;
&gt;2.3  Emergencies
&gt;
&gt;In an emergency situation where there is immediate danger of death or
&gt;serious physical injury to any person, or conspiratorial activities
&gt;threatening national security or characteristic of organized crime,
&gt;Title III permits any investigative or law enforcement officer
&gt;specially designated by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney
&gt;General, or the Associate Attorney General, or by the principal
&gt;prosecuting attorney of any state or subdivision thereof, to intercept
&gt;communications provided an application for a court order is made within
&gt;48 hours.  In the event a court order is not issued, the contents of
&gt;any intercepted communication is treated as having been obtained in
&gt;violation of Title III.
&gt;
&gt;In New York State, even an emergency situation requires a court order
&gt;from a judge.  However, the judge may grant a temporary court order
&gt;based on an oral application from the District Attorney.  The oral
&gt;communication must be recorded and transcribed, and must be followed by
&gt;a written application within 24 hours.  The duration of a temporary
&gt;warrant cannot exceed 24 hours and cannot be renewed except through a
&gt;written application.
&gt;
&gt;2.4  Execution of a Court Order 
&gt;
&gt;2.4.1  Installation of a Wiretap
&gt;
&gt;To execute a court order for a wiretap, the investigative or law
&gt;enforcement officer takes the court order or emergency provision to the
&gt;communications service provider.  Normally, the service provider is the
&gt;local exchange carrier.  When served with a court order, the service
&gt;provider (or landlord, custodian, or other person named) is mandated
&gt;under Title III to assist in the execution of the interception by
&gt;providing all necessary information, facilities, and technical
&gt;assistance.  The service provider is compensated for reasonable
&gt;expenses incurred.  In light of rapid technological developments
&gt;including cellular telephones and integrated computer networks, the New
&gt;Jersey statute also requires the service provider to give technical
&gt;assistance and equipment to fulfill the court order.  This requirement
&gt;has not yet been tested in court.
&gt;
&gt;Normally, the government leases a line from the service provider and
&gt;the intercepted communications are transmitted to a remote government
&gt;monitoring facility over that line.  In many cases, the bridging
&gt;connection is made within the service provider's central office
&gt;facility.  Alternatively, a law enforcement agency may request the
&gt;service provider to give the "pairs and appearances" (a place to
&gt;connect to the suspect's line) in the "local loop" for the suspect's
&gt;phone.  A law enforcement technician then makes the connection.
&gt;
&gt;When a suspect's telephone is subject to change (e.g., because the
&gt;person is attempting to evade or thwart interception), then a "roving"
&gt;wiretap, which suspends the specification of the telephone, may be
&gt;used.  In this case, prior to intercepting communications, the officer
&gt;must use some other method of surveillance in order to determine the
&gt;exact location and/or telephone number of the facility being used.
&gt;Once determined, the location or telephone number is given to the
&gt;service provider for coordination and prompt assistance.  The officer
&gt;may not intercept communications randomly in order to track a person
&gt;(random or mass surveillance is not permitted under any
&gt;circumstances).
&gt;
&gt;2.4.2  Minimization
&gt;
&gt;Once any electronic surveillance begins, the law enforcement officer
&gt;must "minimize" -- that is, attempt to limit the interception of
&gt;communications to the specified offenses in the court order.  Prior to
&gt;the surveillance, a federal or state attorney holds a "minimization
&gt;meeting" with the investigators who will be participating in the case
&gt;to ensure that the rules are followed.
&gt;
&gt;Minimization is normally accomplished by turning off the intercept and
&gt;then performing a spot check every few minutes to determine if the
&gt;conversation has turned to the subject of the court order.  This avoids
&gt;picking up family gossip.  Special problems may arise where criminals
&gt;communicate in codes that are designed to conceal criminal activity in
&gt;what sounds like mundane household discussion.  If an intercepted
&gt;communication is in a code or foreign language, and if someone is not
&gt;reasonably available to interpret the code or foreign language, then
&gt;the conversation can be recorded and minimization deferred until an
&gt;expert in that code or language is available to interpret the
&gt;communication.  Should a wiretap fail to meet the minimization
&gt;parameters, all of the evidence obtained from the wiretap could be
&gt;inadmissible.
&gt;
&gt;2.4.3  Recording
&gt;
&gt;All intercepted communications are to be recorded when possible.  As a
&gt;practical mater, law enforcement officers make working copies of the
&gt;original tapes.  In many instances at the state and local level, the
&gt;originals are delivered to the prosecutor's office and maintained in
&gt;the prosecutor's custody.  The copies are screened by the case officer
&gt;for pertinent conversations (e.g., "I'll deliver the dope at 8:00
&gt;pm.").  A compilation of the relevant conversations, together with the
&gt;corroboratory surveillances often provides the probable cause for
&gt;search warrants and/or arrest warrants.
&gt;
&gt;2.4.4  Termination of Electronic Surveillance
&gt;
&gt;Electronic surveillance must terminate upon attainment of the
&gt;objectives, or in any event within 30 days. To continue an interception
&gt;beyond 30 days, the officer, through a government attorney, must apply
&gt;for and be granted an extension based upon a new application and court
&gt;order.
&gt;
&gt;When the period of a court order, or extension thereof, expires, the
&gt;original tapes must be made available to the issuing judge and sealed
&gt;under court supervision.  The tapes must be maintained in such fashion
&gt;for 10 years.
&gt;
&gt;2.5  Notification and Use of Intercepted Communications as Evidence
&gt;
&gt;Upon termination of an interception, the judge who issued the court
&gt;order must notify the persons named in the order that the interception
&gt;took place.  Normally, this must be done within 90 days, but it may be
&gt;postponed upon showing of good cause.  If the judge determines that it
&gt;would be in the interest of justice to make portions of the intercepted
&gt;communications available to the subjects, the judge may do so.
&gt;
&gt;The contents of the communications may not be used as evidence in any
&gt;trial or hearing unless each party has received a copy of the
&gt;application and court order at least 10 days in advance of the trial,
&gt;and has been given the opportunity to move to suppress the evidence.  A
&gt;motion to suppress the evidence may be made on the grounds that it was
&gt;not obtained in complete conformance with the laws.
&gt;
&gt;2.6  Reports
&gt;
&gt;Within 30 days after the expiration or denial of a court order, Title
&gt;III requires that the judge provide information about the order to the
&gt;Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO). Each year the
&gt;Attorney General (or a designated Assistant Attorney General) must
&gt;report, on behalf of the federal government, to the AO a summary of all
&gt;orders and interceptions for the year; reports for state and local
&gt;jurisdictions are made by the principal prosecuting attorney of the
&gt;jurisdiction.  The AO then integrates these summaries into an annual
&gt;report: "Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the
&gt;Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications (Wiretap
&gt;Report)" covering all federal and state electronic surveillance,
&gt;including wiretaps.  The 1992 report is about 200 pages and includes
&gt;information about each interception authorized in 1992, update
&gt;information for interceptions authorized in 1982-1991, and summary
&gt;statistics.  The summary statistics include the following data (numbers
&gt;in parenthesis are the 1992 figures):
&gt;
&gt;   (1) number of interceptions authorized (919), denied (0), and
&gt;       installed (846)
&gt;
&gt;   (2) average duration (in days) of original authorization (28) and
&gt;       extensions (30)
&gt;
&gt;   (3) the place/facility where authorized (303 single family dwelling,
&gt;       135 apartment, 3 multi-dwelling, 119 business, 4 roving, 66
