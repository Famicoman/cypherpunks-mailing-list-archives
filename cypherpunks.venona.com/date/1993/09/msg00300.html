Hm... something weird happened since I didn't send out four copies of
the remailer list.

And a message I sent a while ago hasn't appeared yet...?

First, I've been told that some people are concerned about my
signature appearing on the remailer keys.  I sign every remailer key I
verify, hopefully in addition to the signature already present from
the remailer operator... so if you run a remailer, sign the key if you
haven't, and mail it to me, preferable with your public key because I
don't like "unknown signator" messages.  I will include it in the
pubkeys.tar.gz distribution I put (with Eric's help) on soda.  That
way it won't look like I'm signing every remailer key all by myself :-)

Anyway, this is a remailer I've been using for various testing
purposes, but haven't announced (and you thought I was joking when I
said people are running remailers they haven't announced :-) It is set
up in a friend's account with his permission since he is away working
in NH with no telnet priveleges.

This may become the preferred remailer on rosebud.  I have been told
by a lawyer that running a remailer from an account I no longer have
legitimate access to breaks about three laws in Texas.  :(  Maybe
eventually I'll spring for a commercial setup where I have a little
more say.

My old account (elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu) has been locked since I am
no longer in that graduate group (or at that university for that
matter).  However, the remailer still works, since my directory
structure remains. So, I mailed to two people in charge on rosebud,
and have asked them to get back to me if they want the remailer
cancelled.  I haven't heard back, so maybe they support it!  Actually
though, since the remailer doesn't take up much space nor does it eat
much cpu, they may very well not care.

But my friend's account is still going strong :-)

I've retested the remailing functions, and here is the key (keyid BBC00D)

It isn't the original key since I zapped it when I was shuffling
around directories to support caching (which I have not enabled).
Sorry!
