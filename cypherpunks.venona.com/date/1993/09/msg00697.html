&gt;       combination, 289 other)
&gt;
&gt;   (4) major offenses involved (634 narcotics, 90 racketeering, 66
&gt;       gambling, 35 homicide/ assault, 16 larceny/theft, 9 kidnapping,
&gt;       8 bribery, 7 loansharking/usury/extortion, 54 other)
&gt;
&gt;   (5) average number of (a) persons intercepted (117), (b)
&gt;       interceptions (1,861), and (c) incriminating intercepts (347)
&gt;       per order where interception devices were installed
&gt;
&gt;   (6) average cost of interception ($46,492)
&gt;
&gt;   (7) type of surveillance used for the 846 interceptions installed
&gt;       (632 telephone, 38 microphone, 113 electronic, 63 combination)
&gt;
&gt;   (8) number of persons arrested (2,685) and convicted (607) as the
&gt;       result of 1992 intercepts
&gt;
&gt;   (9) activity taking place during 1992 as the result of intercepts
&gt;       terminated in years 1982-1991, including number of arrests
&gt;       (1211), trials (280), motions to suppress that are granted (14),
&gt;       denied (141), and pending (37), and convictions (1450) (there is
&gt;       a lag between interceptions, arrests, and convictions, with many
&gt;       arrests and most convictions associated with a wiretap that
&gt;       terminated in one year taking place in subsequent years)
&gt;
&gt;Most of the above data is broken down by jurisdiction.  Of the 919
&gt;authorized intercepts, 340 (37%) were federal.  New York State had 197,
&gt;New Jersey 111, Florida 80, and Pennsylvania 77.  The remaining 114
&gt;intercepts were divided among 18 states, none of which had more than 17
&gt;intercepts.  During the past decade, the average number of authorized
&gt;intercepts per year has been about 780.
&gt;
&gt;Individual law enforcement agencies also require internal reports.  For
&gt;example, the New York Sate Police requires that each week, the Troop or
&gt;Detail Captain prepare a report summarizing the status of all
&gt;eavesdropping activity within the unit, including the productivity and
&gt;plans for each electronic surveillance installation and a brief
&gt;synopsis of pertinent activity.  This is sent to the New York State
&gt;Police Division Headquarters Captain who prepares a report summarizing
&gt;the status of all eavesdropping installations.
&gt;
&gt;One of the reasons for the significant amount of post wiretap reporting
&gt;is to provide a substantial record for legislatures when considering
&gt;whether or not to reenact or modify wiretap statutes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;3.  FISA Interceptions
&gt;
&gt;Title 50 USC, Sections 1801-1811, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
&gt;Act (FISA) of 1978, covers electronic surveillance for foreign
&gt;intelligence purposes (including counterintelligence and
&gt;counterterrorism).  It governs wire and electronic communications sent
&gt;by or intended to be received by United States persons (citizens,
&gt;aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, corporations, and
&gt;associations of U.S. persons) who are in the U.S. when there is a
&gt;reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for
&gt;law enforcement purposes; nonconsensual wire intercepts that are
&gt;implemented within the U.S.; and radio intercepts when the sender and
&gt;all receivers are in the U.S. and a warrant would be required for law
&gt;enforcement purposes.  It does not cover intercepts of U.S. persons who
&gt;are overseas (unless the communications are with a U.S. person who is
&gt;inside the U.S.).  Electronic surveillance conducted under FISA is
&gt;classified.
&gt;
&gt;FISA authorizes electronic surveillance of foreign powers and agents of
&gt;foreign powers for foreign intelligence purposes.  Normally, a court
&gt;order is required to implement a wiretap under FISA.  There are,
&gt;however, two exceptions.  The first is when the communications are
&gt;exclusively between or among foreign powers or involve technical
&gt;intelligence other than spoken communications from a location under the
&gt;open and exclusive control of a foreign power; there is no substantial
&gt;risk that the surveillance will acquire the communications to or from a
&gt;U.S.person; and proposed minimization procedures meet the requirements
&gt;set forth by the law.  Under those conditions, authorization can be
&gt;granted by the President through the Attorney General for a period up
&gt;to one year.  The second is following a declaration of war by
&gt;Congress.  Then the President, though the Attorney General, can
&gt;authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes
&gt;without a court order for up to 15 days.
&gt;
&gt;Orders for wiretaps are granted by a special court established by
&gt;FISA.  The court consists of seven district court judges appointed by
&gt;the Chief Justice of the United States.  Judges serve seven-year
&gt;terms.
&gt;
&gt;3.1  Application for a Court Order
&gt;
&gt;Applications for a court order are made by Federal officers and require
&gt;approval by the Attorney General.  Each application must include:
&gt;
&gt;  (1) the Federal officer making the application;
&gt;
&gt;  (2) the Attorney General's approval;
&gt;
&gt;  (3) the target of the electronic surveillance;
&gt;
&gt;  (4) justification that the target is a foreign power or agent of a
&gt;      foreign power (except no U.S person can be considered a foreign power
&gt;      or agent thereof solely based on activities protected by the First
&gt;      Amendment) and that the facilities or places where the surveillance
&gt;      is be directed will be used by the same;
&gt; 
&gt;  (5) the proposed minimization procedures, which must meet certain
&gt;      requirements to protect the privacy of U.S. persons;
&gt;
&gt;  (6) the nature of the information sought and type of communications
&gt;      subjected to surveillance;
&gt;
&gt;  (7) certification(s) by the Assistant to the President for National
&gt;      Security Affairs or other high-level official in the area of
&gt;      national security or defense (Presidential appointee subject to
&gt;      Senate confirmation) that the information sought is foreign
&gt;      intelligence information and that such information cannot
&gt;      reasonably be obtained by normal investigative methods;
&gt;
&gt;  (8) the means by which the surveillance will be effected;
&gt;
&gt;  (9) the facts concerning all previous applications involving the same
&gt;      persons, facilities, or places;
&gt;
&gt; (10) the period of time for the interception (maximum 90 days or,
&gt;      when the target is a foreign power, one year);
&gt;
&gt; (11) coverage of all surveillance devices to be employed and the
&gt;      minimization procedures applying to each.
&gt;
&gt;Some of the above information can be omitted when the target is a
&gt;foreign power.  
&gt;
&gt;Within the FBI, the process of applying for a court order under FISA is
&gt;as exacting and subject to review as under Title III.  The main
&gt;differences are that under FISA, the FBI Intelligence Division is
&gt;involved rather than the Criminal Investigative Division, the DOJ
&gt;Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) is involved rather than
&gt;either the U.S. Attorney's Office or the DOJ Criminal Division, and the
&gt;application is approved by the Attorney General (or Acting Attorney
&gt;General) rather than by a lower DOJ official.
&gt;
&gt;3.2  Issuance of a Court Order
&gt;
&gt;Before a judge can approve an application, the judge must determine
&gt;that the authorizations are valid; that there is probable cause to
&gt;believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign
&gt;power or agent of a foreign power and that the facilities or places
&gt;where the surveillance is be directed will be used by the same; and
&gt;that the proposed minimization procedures meet the requirements set
&gt;forth in the law.  If the judge approves the application, an order is
&gt;issued specifying the relevant information from the application and
&gt;directing the communication carrier, landlord, custodian, or other
&gt;specified person to furnish all necessary information, facilities, and
&gt;technical assistance and to properly maintain under security procedures
&gt;any records relating to the surveillance.
&gt;
&gt;3.3  Emergencies
&gt;
&gt;In an emergency situation, the Attorney General or designee can
&gt;authorize the use of electronic surveillance provided the judge is
&gt;notified at the time and an application is made to the judge within 24
&gt;hours.  If such application is not obtained, then the judge notifies
&gt;any U.S. persons named in the application or subject to the
&gt;surveillance, though such notification can be postponed or forgone upon
&gt;showing of good cause.
&gt;
&gt;3.4  Use of Intercepted Communications as Evidence
&gt;
&gt;Like Title III, FISA places strict controls on what information can be
&gt;acquired through electronic surveillance and how such information can
&gt;be used.  No information can be disclosed for law enforcement purposes
&gt;except with the proviso that it may only be used in a criminal
&gt;proceedings under advance authorization from the Attorney General.  If
&gt;the government intends to use such information in court, then the
&gt;aggrieved person must be notified in advance.  The person may move to
&gt;suppress the evidence.
&gt;
&gt;3.5  Reports
&gt;
&gt;Each year, the Attorney General must give the Administrative Office of
&gt;the United States Courts (AO) a report of the number of FISA
&gt;applications and the number of orders and extensions granted, modified,
&gt;or denied.  In 1992, there were 484 orders.  Since 1979, there has been
&gt;an average of a little over 500 FISA orders per year.
&gt;
&gt;Because intercepts conducted under FISA are classified, detailed
&gt;information analogous to that required under Title III is not reported
&gt;to the AO, nor made available to the public.  However, records of
&gt;Attorney General certifications, applications, and orders granted must
&gt;be held for at least 10 years, and the Attorney General must inform two
&gt;Congressional oversight committees of all surveillance activity on a
&gt;semiannual basis.  These committees are the House Permanent Select
&gt;Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on
&gt;Intelligence.
