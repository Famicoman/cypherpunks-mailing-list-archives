&gt; Ed Carp Said:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It has long been held that there is an exemption to 'patent infringment'
&gt; &gt; for educational or other "non-commercial" uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this just for RSA, or for all patents?  If PKP wanted to forbid
&gt; academic use of RSA (or require a license for it), could they legally
&gt; do so?  Assume for now that the patent is valid, which it may not
&gt; be...

I'm under the impression that it's for any patent, but I'm not a lawyer (I
just play one on the net [grin]).

&gt; I ask all this because I often hear researchers looking for a cure for
&gt; (insert your favorite aliment here) complain that they have to pay
&gt; patent royalties on the gentically-modified animals they use in their
&gt; work, and if, say, two patented rabbits produce offspring, they
&gt; have to pay royalties on each of the offspring as well.  This is
&gt; academic use (to me anyway; I don't know about legally), but requires
&gt; royalties.

I think it's because they are using them to make $$$.  I think.  :)

Here's the README from the RSA folks that I got with RSAREF.  Hope it answers
one or two of your questions. :)

                              RSAREF(TM):
          A Cryptographic Toolkit for Privacy-Enhanced Mail

                           RSA Laboratories
               (A division of RSA Data Security, Inc.)
                            April 20, 1992


This document copyright (C) 1992 RSA Laboratories, a division of RSA
Data Security, Inc. License is granted to reproduce, copy, post, or
distribute in any manner, provided this document is kept intact and
no modifications, deletions, or additions are made.


WHAT IS IT?

RSAREF is a cryptographic toolkit designed to facilitate rapid
deployment of Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) implementations.
RSAREF represents the fruits of RSA Data Security's commitment to the
U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) to provide free cryptographic source code in support of a PEM
standard. RSA Laboratories offers RSAREF in expectation of PEM's
forthcoming publication as an Internet standard.

Part of RSA's commitment to DARPA was to authorize Trusted Information
Systems of Glenwood, MD, to distribute a full PEM implementation. That
implementation will be available this spring.

RSAREF supports the following PEM-specified algorithms:

     o    RSA encryption and key generation, as defined by RSA
            Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

     o    MD2 and MD5 message digests

     o    DES (Data Encryption Standard) in cipher-block chaining mode

RSAREF is written in the C programming language as a library that can
be called from an application program. A simple PEM implementation
can be built directly on top of RSAREF, together with message parsing
and formatting routines and certificate-management routines. RSAREF
is distributed with a demonstration program that shows how one might
build such an implementation.

The name "RSAREF" means "RSA reference." RSA Laboratories intends
RSAREF to serve as a portable, educational, reference implementation
of cryptography.


WHAT YOU CAN (AND CANNOT) DO WITH RSAREF

The license at the end of this note gives legal terms and conditions.
Here's the layman's interpretation, for information only and with no
legal weight:

     1.   You can use RSAREF in personal, non-commercial applications,
          as long as you follow the interface described in the RSAREF
          documentation. You can't use RSAREF in any commercial
          (moneymaking) manner of any type, nor can you use it to
          provide services of any kind to any other party. For
          information on commercial licenses of RSAREF-compatible
          products, please contact RSA Data Security. (Special
          arrangements are available for educational institutions and
          non-profit organizations.)

     2.   You can give others RSAREF and programs that interface to
          RSAREF, under the same terms and conditions as your RSAREF
          license.

     3.   You can modify RSAREF as required to port it to other
          operating systems and compilers, as long as you give a copy
          of the results to RSA Laboratories. Other changes require
          written consent.

     4.   You can't send RSAREF outside the United States or Canada, or
          give it to anyone who is not a U.S. or Canadian citizen and
          doesn't have a U.S. "green card." (These are U.S. State and
          Commerce Department requirements, because RSA and DES are
          export-controlled technologies. Without the export-control
          restrictions, RSAREF would be available by anonymous FTP.)


HOW TO GET IT

To obtain RSAREF, read the license at the end of the note and return a
copy of the following paragraph by electronic mail to
&lt;rsaref-administrator@rsa.com&gt;:

     I acknowledge that I have read the RSAREF Program License
     Agreement and understand and agree to be bound by its terms and
     conditions, including without limitation its restrictions on
     foreign reshipment of the Program and information related to the
     Program. The electronic mail address to which I am requesting
     that the program be transmitted is located in the United States
     of America or Canada and I am a United States citizen, a Canadian
     citizen, or a permanent resident of the United States. The RSAREF
     Program License Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement
     between RSA Laboratories and me relating to the Program, and
     supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and
     any other communications between RSA Laboratories and me relating
     to the Program.

RSAREF is distributed by electronic mail in UNIX(TM) "uuencoded" TAR
format. When you receive it, store the contents of the message in a
file, and run your operating system's "uudecode" and TAR programs.
For example, suppose you store the contents of your message in the
file 'contents'. You would run the commands:

     uudecode contents             # produces rsaref.tar
     tar xvf rsaref.tar

RSAREF includes about 60 files organized into the following
subdirectories:

     doc       documentation on RSAREF and RDEMO
     install   makefiles for various operating systems
     rdemo     RDEMO demonstration program
     source    RSAREF source code and include files
     test      test scripts for RDEMO


USERS' GROUP

RSA Laboratories maintains the electronic-mail users' group
&lt;rsaref-users@rsa.com&gt; for discussion of RSAREF applications, bug
fixes, etc. To join the users' group, send electronic mail to
