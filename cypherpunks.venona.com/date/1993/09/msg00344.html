&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Fellow Linux Users,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have read the messages regarding donations to Linus in order for hime
&gt;&gt; to continue the development of Linux. I will even admit that I am
&gt;&gt; surprised that people are genuinely interested in rewarding the creator
&gt;&gt; of Linux for his contributions.
&gt;&gt; This has moved me in ways I can understand, so I am going to do the
&gt;&gt; following. On Monday, September 13, I will open and deposit $100.00 in a
&gt;&gt; trust account. Anyone interested in contributing to the Linus Dream
&gt;&gt; Machine Fund can send a donation which will be deposited in the account.
&gt;&gt; During this time, we will find out from Linus what his dream machine
&gt;&gt; consists of and figure out the ammount of money needed to achieve this
&gt;&gt; machine. At the time when we receive the amount, a machine will be
&gt;&gt; configured to meet Linus' specifications and sent off to him.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Of course the question will be how can you confirm that I am not taking
&gt;&gt; this money in Linus name and going to have a big party with it. Well, I
&gt;&gt; am hoping that the goodwill of the net will out-weigh any pessimistic
&gt;&gt; views but if not, I have come up with a plan.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All monies received will be amounts will be publicly posted. When money
&gt;&gt; is received, I will send the person a receipt which will be signed with
&gt;&gt; a public key signature of mine (using PGP 2.0). Each week, I will post
&gt;&gt; to the net a total of all monies received, and a person can check to see
&gt;&gt; if his or her name is on the list. The account will be set up as a trust
&gt;&gt; account with myself as administrator limited to withdrawing of funds to
&gt;&gt; be distributed to one Linus Torvald (Sorry, I have the spelling of the
&gt;&gt; name somewhere...) in Finland. So, that will limit the money
&gt;&gt; distrubution. Also to all interested parties in the united States, I
&gt;&gt; will send via e-mail the (800) automated account inquiry number for BoA,
&gt;&gt; as well as account information and any needed access number need to find
&gt;&gt; the status of the account.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As mentioned above, when an amount is reached which will allow Linus to
&gt;&gt; purchase his dream machine (Please bear in mind Linus, that you need to
&gt;&gt; monitor the posting and vary your list according to funds available),
&gt;&gt; BoA will cut a certified funds check to Linus, and only to Linus.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Considering what we have received from Linus, I think that this would be
&gt;&gt; a noble gesture on the part of all of us who without Linus would have
&gt;&gt; been doomed to buying some version of Un*x and paying a stiff prices for
&gt;&gt; all the add-ons which the Linux provides us for free. Furthermore, this
&gt;&gt; would serve to show the goodwill of a community based not on race,
&gt;&gt; color, or creed, but upon content of character. Let's face it, few of us
&gt;&gt; ever get to meet people who post via netnews or write programs which we
&gt;&gt; tend to use day to day. Yet we communicate with each other as if we have
&gt;&gt; known each other for long periods of time. We instruct each other, we
&gt;&gt; learn from each other, we argue (flame) each other, and we grow from all
&gt;&gt; of this. I believe that the Internet serves as a moderator of
&gt;&gt; internation goodwill. Let's see if we can take it one step forward, and
&gt;&gt; see if the goodwill extends all the way to rewarding someone for a great
&gt;&gt; contibution to our community.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If anyone has any suggestions, rebuttals, or general comments on how to
&gt;&gt; make this idea of mine work, please feel free to e-mail me or post for
&gt;&gt; general discussion.
