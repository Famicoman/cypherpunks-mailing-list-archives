Re:  Moby Crypto and the Austin Code Works
 
 
Recently you phoned Maria Guthery at the Austin Code Works (512-258-0785)
to voice your concern about the publication for export
of my product 'Moby Crypto'.
 
As the editor and author of the compilation I made sure not to include
any executable code -- only the algorithmic description in C source code
that can be found (and exported) from scores of books and journals from
the US distributed throughout the world.
 
I believe that this material qualifies for the 'public domain' technical
documentation exception under the current DTR rules.
It seems to me that proscribing the publication of material because it is
conveyed on a magnetic media rather than paper pulp is an NSA initiative
that is both destructive to our basic freedom of expression and to the
trade renaissance that Vice President Al Gore and the Clinton Administration
are trying to foster.
 
Even the Supreme Court recognizes the role of the computer media in
protecting our freedom; beginning this 1993 calendar year all decisions
will be provided in electronic form. Further, as you may know, it was
recently decided that White House records in electronic form must be
protected as a permanent archive of our government.  Clearly, magnetic
media must be treated as a logical extension of the power and fundamental
right of the print media.
 
Please phone, fax, e-mail or post your ideas or any literature to me that
you think useful if I have misapprehended the situation.
 
Of course if you wish I will send you a gratis copy of the software
(about nine megabytes of sources for DES, RSA, IDEA, Lucifer, PGP, SHA,
and so on) for your advice and comments.
 
Very truly yours,
 
 
GRADY WARD
 
 
--------------------- WHAT YOU SHOULD DO ---------------------
 
NSA and the US Treasury has started a new, agressive campaign to
prevent the spread of cryptographic ideas, algorithms, sources,
and documentation.  The subpoena was served on the ACW in the night
because they MIGHT have sold a copy of source code, already available
worlwide, to a foreign national.
 
If you value the freedom to disseminate ideas on both paper and magentic
and electronic media, you should immediately preserve your right to
have such knowledge by obtaining a copy of the source to Pretty Good Privacy
and all other cryptographic materials before a possible complete blackout
of such material is attempted by the US authorities.
 
It is not yet against the law to possess source code to PGP, the world's
foremost encryption application in the United States.  Source is available
for a variety of platforms including MS-DOS, Unix, and Macintosh from
the following sites:
 
soda.berkeley.edu
ghost.dsi.unimi.it
nic.funet.fi
ota.ox.ac.uk
van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca
 
and many other sites
 
For more information about PGP,
send a blank mail message to:
pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk
