OK, here's an *excellent* opportunity to get some cypherpunk exposure
on RISKS. Amazingly, we haven't really been seen there before. I move
that T.C. May or some other prominent cypherpunk write a letter
representative of group interest and ideas on the subject. But anyone
who feels they have something to say on the subject should pass on a
letter to increase our chances of `getting published'. I would, but
offshore data havens are not my niche. 

Everyone, *don't* argue about the specifics of the letter on the list
-- we will never get it sent that way -- but suggestions are OK). then,
in a segue (that's the *correct* spelling, Mr. P. `segway' Ferguson :) 

In the letter, consider talking about the Cypherpunks media exposure in
NYT, Village Voice, Whole Earth, etc.  However, if the c'punk mailing
list is advertised, be *sure* to point out that its up to ~30 messages
a day -- I think this helps alleviate spurious newcomers.

I would recommend that the more anarchic aspects of the issue of Data
Havens be glossed over, such as tax evasion, and just emphasize the
non-threatening aspects such as digital cash, etc. so as not to startle
all the fuddy duddies. I'm sure they will figure out the implications
without any help from us. We do *not* want to come off as a
cyberspatial terrorist organization (however close we may actually be
:)  Definitely, include a pointer to Chaum.

Strike while the iron is hot! this is a mainstream opportunity for
increased press exposure and attention to the cypherpunk cause. You'll
notice the person inquiring is a reporter. chances are the articles he
is referring to were cypherpunk-based. I wonder. Also, he *may* be
writing an article and purposely not mentioning to avoid competition.

Subject: Offshore Data Havens

As a reader of RISKS who combines his vocation, journalism, with his
avocation, computers, I'm writing in with a request.  In the course of working
on an assignment for one of the TV networks, I came across references to
"offshore data havens."  These are data networks, alleged to be in the
formative process, which will glean data by means fair and foul from the
world's legitimate data bases.  The implication is that formerly confidential
information, be it about individuals, corporations or governments, would seep
across networks.  The information would then be available, at a price, to
anyone who wanted it.
 
My questions are:

* Are "offshore data havens" actually being formed, and if so, where?
* What are the inherent problems that come to mind?  Don't be afraid to state
  the obvious; television audiences aren't experts in this area.
 
I'd love to see this become a topic for discussion on RISKS, but would also
appreciate (with thanks in advance) any responses sent to me directly.
