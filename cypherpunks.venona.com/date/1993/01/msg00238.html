&gt;&gt; I am doubtful of the 40,000 figure even with contract employees. That's
&gt;&gt; a small army. What the hell could keep that many people busy? (shudder)

&gt;NSA occupies two very large office buildings, including the longest
&gt;corridor in the world (a mile, if I recall correctly, but my copy of
&gt;"The Puzzle Palace" is not handy). I went and took a look, and can
&gt;confirm the parking lot is _huge_.

As is the case with a good many other gov't. agencies, one can be sure
that all the crew are not 9-to-5ers showing up at one office.

&gt;The 40,000 figure may or may not be accurate, as the NSA won't say.
&gt;Some say the employment is closer to 100,000. Certainly it is much
&gt;higher than that of the CIA.

It has been a good many years since I traveled in the lower strata of
these circles, but it was my information that the NSA, at least at that
time, had a manpower pool "hugely greater than the CIA's."  It is my
understanding that the NSA budget is highly classified - unavailable
even to most members of Congress.

&gt;Bear in mind that they are the nation's
&gt;primary SIGINT facility...

I believe you'll find that the NSA also is involved in SATINT &amp; ELINT
as well.  Never Say Anythings are busy little bees.

&gt;operating the various listening posts in
&gt;conjunction with military personnel (via Army Security Agency, Naval
&gt;Security Group, Air Forc, etc.).

It is my belief from personal experience that the NSA requests &amp;
receives operational assistance from those innocuous agencies in
positions to gather information of use to the NSA in the course of their
routine duties.

&gt;As always, read James Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace," which gets
&gt;referred to a lot on this list.

I've tried to read this famous tome a couple of times, but have been
unable to hack its turgid prose.  Someday. perhaps...

&gt; Public Key: waiting for the dust to settle.

Excuse me, Tim?
