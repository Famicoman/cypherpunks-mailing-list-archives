Hiya....
        I found this post in a newsgroup that I try to follow.  Don't know
about etiquette about how this should have been edited, so it's all here,
headers and all.  Anyway, I would like to know if the info is accurate, bull or
what?
        FYI, the ISA means Internal Security Act (back in Malaysia) and they
have had UUCP for a few years (but UUCP's hardly enough for the kinds of
traffic they are talking about, but then a few private companies *did* have
full Internet, so..... it's possible that the "thingy" was there without public
knowledge....

        sorry about the previous post.  The mailer cut off
everything after any "--" line, which I used to separate the
forwarded message.  Here'e the complete message.

|&gt; Now with Malaysia officially on Internet, I wonder if the ISA patrol
|&gt; will be monitoring this (and maybe s.c.malaysia) newsgroup.  If so, then
|&gt; I guess there'll be no more criticizing the government -- that could
|&gt; get you detained without a trial.  And since posting here could be
|&gt; interpreted as publishing, I guess there'll be no more talk on "sensitive"
|&gt; issues or you'll be in hot soup under the Seditions Act.  Of course, now
|&gt; we can't talk about freedom or basic human rights either because Mr.
|&gt; what's-his-name here has declared that it has no place in Malaysian
|&gt; society; therefore it has no place in s.c.a or s.c.m too!
|&gt;
|&gt; SIGH!  Soc.culture.asean will never be quite the same again...  But hey,
|&gt; look on the bright side... we can always talk about food.

        When in doubt, assume they will (or for that matter, have been).
In fact, Malaysia has *ALWAYS* been capable of monitoring Usenet news since a
long time ago, since Malaysia has long been connected via UUCP, which is
capable of providing a news feed.

        Included below is an article that appeared in alt.bbs.allsysop.
It's source has NOT been validated.   It is included here for your

|&gt; I found the following message on a land line BBS. Since many packet users
|&gt; also have modems and call land line BBSs, and many sysops also run such
|&gt; BBSs I think that the information in the following message is something
|&gt; we should all be aware of.
|&gt;
|&gt;                              ***
|&gt;
|&gt;   As someone involved in the telephone industry on the level of security
|&gt;   and data integrity... I would like to inform everyone that uses modems
|&gt;   and/or are bbs operators of some information.
|&gt;
|&gt;   The first thing that everyone that uses a modem should know is that
|&gt;   every time you fire up your modem your activating monitoring equipment
|&gt;   somewhere in the U.S.  I have worked for several large telephone
|&gt;   networks that routinely monitor and reroute modem and fax transmissions
|&gt;   through devices that allow them to view what is being transmitted and
|&gt;   even decodes encrypted data and fax packets used by major corporations
|&gt;   and governmental agencies.  This is allowed under the heading of
|&gt;   "Maintenance Monitoring" and may be continued for up to 6 months without
|&gt;   the need of any legal paperwork being generated.  Under an obscure
|&gt;   pre-WWII ruling by the agency that is now the FCC... "No information may
|&gt;   be encoded or transmitted over PUBLIC or PRIVATE forms of telephony or
|&gt;   radio with the exception of those agencies involved in the National
|&gt;   Security" a further designation goes on to say "with the exception of
|&gt;   the MORSE system of 'transmittal', any communication that is not
|&gt;   interpretable by the human ear is forbidden and unlawful."
|&gt;
|&gt;   The information gathered goes to 3 seperate database facilities...1 is
|&gt;   codenamed Diana and is located in Brussels, the 2nd is named Fredrick
|&gt;   and is located somewhere in Malaysia, the 3rd is named Elizabeth and is
|&gt;   located in Boulder, Colorado.  The information stored in these systems
|&gt;   is accessable by the US Government, Interpol, Scotland Yard and various
|&gt;   other such agencies.  Your credit rating is also affected by your modem
|&gt;   usage... if you ever get a copy of your credit history and find a
|&gt;   listing that has HN06443 &lt;--= this is a negative risk rating. or a code
|&gt;   87AT4 &lt;---= an even more negative risk rating.... these will usually
|&gt;   have no description on them... and if you inquire about them they will
|&gt;   tell you that it just comes from the system that way.
|&gt;
|&gt;   I am currently working for another major carrier as a consultant and
|&gt;   have been able to watch these systems operate...at one unnamed long
|&gt;   distance carrier here in Columbus Ohio in their NCC, Network Control
|&gt;   Center, you can see several rows of computer terminals which have
|&gt;   approximately 30 to 40 separate windows in each... these windows have
|&gt;   data transmissions that are being monitored... banks of 9 track tapes
|&gt;   are going constantly to record everything.  Everyone should realize that
|&gt;   even if a sysop posts a disclaimer at the beginning of his bbs about no
|&gt;   access to governmental agencies or law enforcement...that it isn't worth
|&gt;   the time it takes to type it in... looking forward to hearing reactions
|&gt;   to this.
|&gt;
|&gt;                              ******
|&gt;
|&gt; I apologize for the length of this message, but it's information that I
|&gt; feel is important, especially for any land-line BBS sysop. Anytime you
|&gt; enter a message, even if it's private, always do it with the assumtion
|&gt; that it's going to be seen by anyone and everyone, everywhere.
|&gt;
|&gt; Tnx
