Oh, come off it.  Your rants under various names (including your own)
are very similar: in tone and style, in topic, in their universal
fixation on PSEUDOSPOOFING, "top cypherpunks", and "cypherpunk
leaders", in time of night sent to the list, in 0 of
punctuation.  Then we have an12070 quoting from private mail to you --
you tried to weasel by saying you'd "communicated with your
colleague", whom you're now calling a "paranoid ranter".  And just
today you made a blatant foul-up in your rant on drug conspiracies:

&gt; said something very bizarre to me, `so Lance, just HOW ARE YOU FEELING
&gt; TODAY?' The strange tone was entirely uncharacteristic of him, and I

Oops.  I find it ironic that for all your rants about PSEUDOSPOOFING,
your practices are the most blatant and long-running example I have
ever encountered.  I would not count your an12070 account as more
than one identity, except that you constantly change the name and
use different ones to contradict others:

   "The Executioner" &lt;an12070@anon.penet.fi&gt;, says:
&gt; I thought that the infamous L. Detweiler had stopped his posting, but it
&gt; appears that he is back, and more neurotic than ever.
   but "S. Boxx" &lt;an12070@anon.penet.fi&gt; says:
&gt; BTW, many thanks to L.Detweiler for his lone help in helping me break a
&gt; corrupt conspiracy and massive cyberspatial hoax.

Enough.

&gt;That's interesting. Perhaps you would like to enumerate these attempts.

You may recall that your very first paranoid claim was that Tim May
and Jamie Dinkelacker were the same person.  You were given the phone
numbers of both -- this was before people became nervous about giving
you any personal information.  Did you ever attempt a reality check?

&gt;If they were,  they would have long ago answered my honest questions in
&gt;a straightforward manner.

Oh, you mean like:
&gt;that by E.Hughes in RISKS, `I have never posted under any other name than
&gt;E.Hughes' obviously do not count, although they may fool some people.

It's not an answer because he didn't ADMIT to his heinous CRIMES, I
guess.  Rot in place, will you?
