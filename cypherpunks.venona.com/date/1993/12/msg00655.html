Once again, we find ourselves facing a new jahre and pondering
the untold wonders of the anarchy of cyberspace!

In celebration of this joyous occasion, I've decided to 
post a compilation of electronic 'zines for your perusal.

I especially like the reference for Practical Anarchy and will
probably send a copy of this message to our old chum, Larry
"the squid" Detweiler.

Enjoy,

- Spooge

This is a summary of electronically-accessible zines.  The format should 
be fairly self-explanatory.  In most cases, descriptions are excerpted from 
the masthead of the zine listed.

[For those of you not acquainted with the zine world, "zine" is short for 
either "fanzine" or "magazine," depending on your point of view.  Zines are 
generally produced by one person or a small group of people, done mostly for 
fun, and often irreverent, bizarre, and/or esoteric.  Zines are not 
"mainstream" publications -- they generally do not contain advertisements 
(except, sometimes, advertisements for other zines), do not have a large 
subscriber base, and are not produced to make money.]

If you have any additions, deletions, or changes to this list, please email
them to johnl@netcom.com.

I will post this list (and/or changes to the list) to various mailing lists 
and Usenet news groups.  It can also be obtained via anonymous FTP from 
netcom.com as "/pub/johnl/zines/e-zine-list", and via email (either single 
issues or subscriptions) from e-zines-request@netcom.com.

If you publish an e-zine, or know someone who does, please send a copy to 
e-zines@netcom.com and I'll add the relevant info to this database.

All comments, suggestions, changes, deletions, etc., are welcomed and 
encouraged.

FUNHOUSE! -- The cyberzine of degenerate pop culture
 "Dedicated to whatever happens to be on my mind at the time I'm writing.  
  The focus will tend to be on those aspects of our fun-filled world which
  aren't given the attention of the bland traditional media, or which have 
  been woefully misinterpreted or misdiagnosed by the same.  FUNHOUSE! is
  basically a happy place, and thus the only real criteria I will try to 
  meet is to refrain from rants, personal attacks, and flames -- and thus 
  FUNHOUSE! is an apolitical place.  Offbeat films, music, literature, and 
  experiences are largely covered, with the one stipulation that articles 
  are attempted to be detailed and well documemnted, although this is no 
  guarantee of completeness or correctness, so that the interested reader 
  may further pursue something which may spark her interest."

  it's far from clear what it might mean to be a "voice" from, or on, the
