``Letters warning `Chuck E. Cheese was nothing compared to this' spur
cancellation of St. Nick''

This is example of the power that can be wrought through more words,
even anonymously. Apparently from no other  cause than a series of
anonymous letters sent to many Colorado malls, many cancelled their
appearances of  Santa Claus. In one mall, a Santa was surrounded by 
undercover police agents and others wore bulletproof vests. I have
been to most of these malls and they are the largest and most
prominent in the entire state.

Anonymous mail carries far more weight today than graffiti sprayed on
a wall! It is an extremely  potent weapon, in the wrong hands! If
this were a prank or hoax (various signs suggest this) it was an
extremely effective and devastating one. And the ultimate goal of
having it all `replayed' back in the media for perverse glee was
achieved spectacularly. It was the front page headline on the
Colorado newspapers.

Merry Christmas, everyone...

===cut=here===

Colorado -- Death threats against Santa Claus have prompted
at least several major malls to cancel their Santas,
disappointing hundreds of children.

Anonymous letters began arriving at malls Dec. 14. The writer
threatened to shoot Santa between the eyes and ``kill more
than an [sic] hundred people.''

Santas at Westminster and Northglenn malls were wearing
bulletproof vests Tuesday, and armed guards were posted
within 10 feet of some Santas.

``Isn't it a shame?'' Westminster Police Chief Dan Montgomery
said. ``Even Santa Claus is a target.''

Monday, malls began receiving follow-up threats from the
writer. Letters declared, ``Time is running out'' and ``Chuck
E. Cheese was nothing compared to this.''

The writer claimed to be a Vietnam veteran angry that Santa
has replaced much of the religious meaning of Christmas. The
typed, identical letters were signed ``Terminator XX.''

``I am filled with much hatred,'' they said. ``You don't know
the horrible things I'm capable of.''

Police said they are taking the threats seriously. The FBI is
investigating.

``What are the chances of it happening?'' Montgomery said.
``Extremely remote. But you have to act as if it's going to
happen.''

The follow-up threats prompted cancellation of Santa at
Southwest Plaza, Cinderella City and the NOrthglenn,
Westminster, Cherry Creek, Aurora, and Southglenn malls.
Officials at other malls are considering the same action.

``We felt it was in the best interests of the public,'' said
Carol Hinson of Aurora Mall.

Some children cried Tuesday when they showed up at Southwest
Plaza and Santa wasn't there.

``This has been a nightmare,'' said manager Eileen Stembler.
``The anger it has caused is phenomenal, that someone would
believe they have the right to take the fantasy out of
Christmas.''

Mall workers posted signs designed to soften the blow. At
Southglenn, a sign read:

``Due to the tremendous amount of gifts Santa must deliver
... Santa and his helpers have gone back to the North Pole to
prepare. Please leave your Christmas wish list at the
Customer Service Center and we will be sure Santa gets it.''

Most of the malls set up tables with pencil and paper so
children could write their Christmas wish lists. Parents who
asked about missing Santas were not informed of the threats.
Some were told that Santa was sick.

The threatening letters were sent to at least five malls,
Westminster, Aurora, Cherry Creek, Northglenn and Southwest
Plaza. They included the line: ``What a sexist thing to
think Santa is a fat man who gives presents to people.''

The letters prompted dozens of metro-area Santas to quit,
forcing malls to scramble for replacements.

Susen Mesco, head of American Events and Promotions, said the
threats prompted 25 of her company's 50 Santas to quit. They
earn $6 to $40 an hour.

``Some of their wives didn't want them to work,''' Mesco
said. ``It's not worth a part-time job. It just isn't.''

Those who stayed half-seriously asked for raises, Mesco said.

``I'm just trying to keep a positive attitude about this,''
said Tony Ratcliff, a 38-year-old Santa who stayed on the
job.  ``The authorities [have] already taken all the
precautions.''

Before Santa was canceled at Southwest Plaza Tuesday, parents
and children waited 45 minutes as he was moved to a
sequestered room on the second floor. When Santa arrived, he
was surrounded by five security guards.

``This set-up, it ruins Christmas,'' said teen-age shopper
Brian Garramone.

At Northglenn Mall last Tuesday night, Santa was surrounded
by undercover security guards and was not allowed to leave
Santa Land. Mall officials said he will not be there today.

Last week, a radio communications system was installed in
Santa Land so Santa and his elves could call for help, said
the mall's attorney April Bennet Stone.

Throughout the Denver area, people were wondering what kind
of person would do this.

``This, unfortunately,'' Mesco said, ``is somebody who
didn't get enough hugs as a child.''
