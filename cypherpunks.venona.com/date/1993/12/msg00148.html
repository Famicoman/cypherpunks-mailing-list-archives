&gt; This would have thwarted the police. Of course you may say,
&gt; how many encrypted cellular conversations take place in that
&gt; part of Columbia, and the answer would probably be close to
&gt; zero if not zero. So just modify the equipment to recognize
&gt; encrypted/scrambled speech or whatever and locate the source.
&gt; Fine, but if Escobar has so much money and so many allies,
&gt; why not buy many encrypted cellular set-ups and distribute
&gt; them to his people (paying them of course) to move
&gt; throughout the region constantly and make cellular encrypted
&gt; phone calls at random?
&gt; 
&gt; Now, tying this in with the 'ol Clipper-chip debate, if
&gt; Escobar who is worth billions of dollars, is smart, and is
&gt; considered one of the biggest drug kingpins in history does
&gt; not use encryption, how many lower-level criminals, who
&gt; don't have the financial resources nor the intelligence will?

Good questions.  The answers are varied.  But, basically, it comes down
to this: Just because the technology is availiable, it doesn't mean
Escobar was aware of it.  There just isn't enough recognition among the
general public of what technology is availiable.  Certainly, there were
a lot of things he could have done to defend himself better.  I don't
think lack of inteligence was Escobar's nemisis, but simply that he did
not have good technical advisors availiable to him, and wasn't aware of
the technology.  There is a lot more necessary than to just say "he
should have used encryption".

First of all, you can't make an encrypted cellular call so easily. 
There do not yet exist many widely availiable systems which can compress
digitized sound in real time to fit within the bandwidth limitations of
cellular telephone technology or most wireline telephone channels. 
We've been over this in our discussions of building secure telephones;
it's not easy, and radio noise caused by cellular makes it even more
difficult.  Even if Escobar had such technology availiable to him, the
person he was calling would also have to have the same encryption
hardware.  I suspect that given the situation, this might not be
possible.  But - if Escobar had high-tech computerized/digital
encryption technology, why would he be using cellular at all?  A
high-speed radio modem would have worked well for encryping all his
communications.  Still, the fact that while all of us cyberwizards here
can talk about what would be possible, building a encrypted
communications network takes a lot of work.  Escobar probably would have
needed to enploy a team of cyrptographers and computer/radio experts -
and they're not easy to find in rural Colombia.
