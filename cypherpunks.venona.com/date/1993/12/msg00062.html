&gt; This is beginning to kill me!  This guy comes from the cmu.edu
&gt; domain and obviously has never tried to get an account on a
&gt; system outside of his institution.  Much less on one of the
&gt; "expensive on-line services", as he put it.

ha ha ...  BTW: I did get an internet mail address not in the cmu.edu domain.

&gt; Here's some news!  Currently the Delphi service offers full
&gt; Internet connectivity (e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher, News)
&gt; for $20 a month for 20 hours of access.  Delphi can be accessed
&gt; through SprintNet which means that most metropolitan areas
&gt; will have a local dial in point.  In the near future America
&gt; On Line has stated that in the near future they too will go
&gt; full connectivity, they charge $9.95 a month for 4 hours
&gt; worth of access.  AOL currently has e-mail available.  That's
&gt; just two of the services that can be accessed from just about
&gt; any city of any real size in the states.

True.  But I could just as well set up my own BBS for about the same price.

&gt; Now, let's talk about those sysops that want to get connected
&gt; to the Interet.  Here in Waco, Texas (a city of about 150,000
&gt; people... 250,000 people if you count all the outlying cities)
&gt; to get a 56K dedicated Internet connection would cost
&gt; something like...
&gt; 
&gt; 	$ 3000.00	Router
&gt; 	$ 1500.00	CSU/DSU
&gt;    	$  600.00	Local Loop Termination/Installation
&gt; 	---------
&gt; 	$ 5100.00	One-time costs.
&gt; 
&gt; 	$   75.00	Regional Network membership fee
&gt; 	$  250.00	Local Loop Charge
&gt; 	---------
&gt; 	$  325.00	Monthly costs.
&gt;
&gt; These figures are ballpark, and some are gueses based on
&gt; experience in dealing with the regional networks here
&gt; in Texas.  I know several sysops here that would easily
&gt; spend $5000.00 on their board in one shot, and could
&gt; easily spend the $300.00 a month for the connection.
&gt; On top of all that, it is a proven fact that people will
&gt; *pay* for Internet connectivity.

Yes, I know there are sysops who could afford this, but the vast
majority couldn't.  I know it's certainly over my budget.

&gt; These costs are based on a dedicated 56K connection.
&gt; A 14.4 or 19.2K SLIP connection would probably be
&gt; *much* less!
&gt; 
&gt; And, as Duncan and so many others are so fond of
&gt; pointing out.  If the gummint would get out of the
&gt; way and let competition happen for the
&gt; local loop these prices would drop dramatically.

Of course... Isn't this what cypherpunks have been wishing for all along?
