<PRE>
I am cleaning out my archives of past mail to respond to. Some people
still persist in believing that absolutely no pseudospoofing is
occuring on behalf of the Cypherpunks. I have over a thousand 
messages that suggest quite to the contrary. Below is one of my
favorites. E.Brandt, a longtime cypherpunk list subscriber, explains
to me that he is Medusa. If anyone wishes to debate my claims on the
existence of pseudospoofing, please do your homework and email Mr.
Brandt to determine the meaning of his message below. I will be most
amused if you get no response, one that complains that he was being
facetious, or one that complains his privacy has been violated. I
would be further amused at anyone's attempts to determine any aspect
of Mr. Brandt's life that suggests he is a real human being.

In the letter, We have the familiar techniques of the ad hominem
attack on S.Boxx (Mr. Brandt is definitely dragging down his
preeminent reputation by claiming that he is in some way affiliated
with me &lt;g&gt;). This is the mandatory `pseudonymity is OK as long as it
glorifies us' hypocrisy of the cypherpunks. The letter also has a
manifestation of Medusa's uncommonly noxious arrogance. She cannot
help but to brag, ``I AM MEDUSA, CONTROLLER OF ALL TENTACLES!''

But the unusual aspect of this message was that exhibited a strong
degree of desperation on the part of Medusa. She actually offered to
apologize if I could reveal how I identify tentacles! Again, we have
the Hughes-May-Gilmore idea that `if there is no evidence, there is
no crime.'  Unfortunately for Medusa, obviously I cannot reveal this
sensitive information. Medusa went away quite upset despite
initiating this conversation,  asking me and my postmaster not to
send any more mail. Mr. Brandt, if you don't want me to send *you*
mail, don't send *me* any.

The source of the desperation was probably due to the increasing 
attention and exposure to cypherpunks `out there' on other mailing
lists and in the newsgroups, which is obviously getting more
difficult to maintain with all the tentacle damage control. They
think that the cascades beneath every new message saying
``L.Detweiler is insane'' effectively nullify the damaging truth and
publicity of the messages. The cypherpunks don't understand that
sometimes when people are most influenced, they are  at first silent.
Damage control by `lackeys' is not effective when the leaders 
themselves are challenged.

Cypherpunks and your leaders, if you wish to convince me or anyone
else that you are not pseudospoofing, you should definitely avoid 
sending anyone a letter like this.
