check out this load of bull that I pulled off of alt.privacy today. 
Reminds me of those chain letters....


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        A lot of people think that PGP encryption is unbreakable and that the
&gt;NSA/FBI/CIA/MJ12 cannot read their mail. This is wrong, and it can be a deadly
&gt;mistake. In Idaho, a left-wing activist by the name of Craig Steingold was
&gt;arrested  _one day_ before he and others wee to stage a protest at government
&gt;buildings; the police had a copy of a message sent by Steingold to another
&gt;activist, a message which had been encrypted with PGP and sent through E-mail.
&gt;
&gt;        Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to 
&gt;allow the NSA to easily break encoded messages. Early in 1992, the author, 
&gt;Paul Zimmerman, was arrested by Government agents. He was told that he 
&gt;would be set up for trafficking narcotics unless he complied. The Government 
&gt;agency's demands were simple: He was to put a virtually undetectable 
&gt;trapdoor, designed by the NSA, into all future releases of PGP, and to
&gt;tell no-one.
&gt;
&gt;        After reading this, you may think of using an earlier version of 
&gt;PGP. However, any version found on an FTP site or bulletin board has been 
&gt;doctored. Only use copies acquired before 1992, and do NOT use a recent 
&gt;compiler to compile them. Virtually ALL popular compilers have been 
&gt;modified to insert the trapdoor (consisting of a few trivial changes) into 
&gt;any version of PGP prior to 2.1. Members of the boards of Novell, Microsoft, 
&gt;Borland, AT&amp;T and other companies were persuaded into giving the order for the 
&gt;modification (each ot these companies' boards contains at least one Trilateral
&gt;Commission member or Bilderberg Committee attendant).
&gt;
&gt;        It took the agency more to modify GNU C, but eventually they did it.
&gt;The Free Software Foundation was threatened with "an IRS investigation",
&gt;in other words, with being forced out of business, unless they complied. The
&gt;result is that all versions of GCC on the FTP sites and all versions above 
&gt;2.2.3, contain code to modify PGP and insert the trapdoor. Recompiling GCC
&gt;with itself will not help; the code is inserted by the compiler into
&gt;itself. Recompiling with another compiler may help, as long as the compiler
&gt;is older than from 1992.
