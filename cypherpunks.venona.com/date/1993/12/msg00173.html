How do you explain your statements I analyzed in RISKS 15.27, where you
posted to cypherpunks promoting your sophisticated pseudospoofing techniques? 
Multiple posting sites, countermeasures and contempt for `opponents' who 
attempt to determine whether your tentacles are who they claim to be.

Frankly, I think you are a baldfaced liar. Are you intellectually challenged
or am I going to have to go root up all the archives to prove it?

You cryptoanarchists are so arrogant. it will be your downfall.

hee, hee, once P.Metzger complained in his typical searing flame fashion
on the cpunk list that the word `cypherpunk' was just too darn subversive
sounding. Mr. Metzger is another classic cryptoanarchist. Hey Perry, could
you send me another mailbomb for tweaking your nose?

let the record show I am in no way agreeing with S.Sternlight &lt;g&gt;

people interested in civilizing cyberspace and repressing the cryptoanarchist
scum should send `subscribe cypherwonks' to majordomo@lists.eunet.fi.
Electronic Democracy is on it's way!

ha, ha, cryptoanarchists beware.

: and for "heavy loads" that strain network resources. And occasionally
: they'll stop and help a stranded Internetter.

and the cryptoanarchists like you will call them `pigs' and resent them
for promoting law and order where you previously had your delightful
lawless anarchy.

: Will President Reno send them in to raid the Cyber-Waco havens?

I dunno, but I hope she cracks down on the cryptoanarchist terrorists like
you.

: I was writing an essay for the Cypherpunks mailing list on the way

: cypherspace, is only a phone call through some digital mixes away). It
: became clear to me that the authorities will hardly countenance the use
: of the Data Highway---the taxpayer's NII--for such uses. 

yes, the cryptoanarchists will be quite at home when it is possible and
rampant. The Cyberspatial Mafia. complete with corruption, bribery, and
hit men.

: (And a lot of other "interesting" uses I could describe. If
: interested, join the Cypherpunks mailing list by sending a request to
: "cypherpunks-request@toad.com".  We were featured on the cover of the
: second issue of "Wired" and in the Summer, '93 issue of "Whole Earth
: Review," etc. An interesting bunch of folks.)

Warning: join the cypherpunks only if you are interested in cryptoanarchist
brainwashing from multiple fake identities, many of them from the leaders
themselves. `An interesting bunch of folks'. Hee, hee. more like 
cryptoanarchists and cyberspatial terrorists and guerillas, masters
of subterfuge and sabotage, gaining increasing respectability and influence
every day. You guys own a congressman yet?

: No, the Data Highway won't likely tolerate "sealed loads" that might
: be accessing offshore gambling dens, kiddie porn rings, or weapons
: secret information markets (not to mention the ever-worrisome
: anonymous markets for assasinations...child's play with digital
: remailers and digital cash).

Poor timmy and your cryptoanarchists, what are you going to do, given that
your favorite black uses are barred and illegal?

: rules and regulations for "fair access," for the allowable data
: packets that can travel on it, and for taxation of the explosion in
: commercial traffic which will inevitably come.
: Hence, the Data Highway Patrol.
: Or maybe they'll call it the "CyberSpace Patrol."

who will prevent people like you from building up arsenals of fake identities
to deceive others. 

: Personally, I hate government programs. I don't want the government
: "helping" with networks, and I don't want a streamlined data highway.
: I like the developing system we've got of zillions of cables,
: satellites, fiber optics, and the like, With lots of suppliers of
: services and lots of rerouting of packets, it makes it real hard to
: enforce the kind of restriction cited above.

poor timmy and his cryptoanarchists don't understand the world they live in.
they are outcasts and misfits who think that all forms of Government and
even Democracy are Orwellian oppressions. they will criticize any system
that attempts to put together secure email, that prevents forgery at the 
protocol level, as Orwellian.

You forgot tax evasion, black marketeering, drug trafficking, pornography,
distribution, espionage, overthrow of governments. When are you going to
update your .sig?

Delightful!
