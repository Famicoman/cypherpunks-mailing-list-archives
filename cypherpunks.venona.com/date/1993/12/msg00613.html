Subject: Unfairly banned from #anime!
From: Casca, bertishg@db.erau.edu

In article &lt;2fkh6v$2f4@scorpius.db.erau.edu&gt; Casca, bertishg@db.erau.edu writes:
&gt;
&gt;On Friday, the 24th of December, I logged on to IRC. I joined #anime! 
&gt;to find that there were only two other people on, [Starman] and Ichijyo.
&gt;I did not find this unusual because it was around 12:00 pm Eastern Time.
&gt;
&gt;I attampted to engage in communication with [Starman] and Ichijyo, but they
&gt;were asleep on channel, meaning that they were logged in, but not doing
&gt;anything, and were not marked as being away. I left to find better company.
&gt;
&gt;During the course of the day I joined and left #anime! several times, both
&gt;as Casca and in another persona I have for another channel, #vampires, as
&gt;Brujah.
&gt;
&gt;During one of the times I joined as Brujah, I attempted to stimulate 
&gt;conversation, the lifeblood of IRC. This is what I did: 
&gt;
&gt;*** Brujah (bertishg@db.erau.edu)  has joined channel #anime!
&gt;
&gt;&lt;Brujah&gt; hey all
&gt;
&gt;                       ** no response **
&gt;
&gt;* Brujah slaps [Starman] around for a bit
&gt;
&gt;&lt;Brujah&gt; Dammit, if you're going to log on channel, either do something or
&gt;+ don't bother joining at all! 
&gt;
&gt;&lt;Brujah&gt; shit....
&gt;
&gt;*** Brujah has left channel #anime!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is, to the best of my recollection, what occured. I did not have a log
&gt;file
&gt;running, but with the exception of some of the words not being verbatim, 
&gt;this is a correct account of what happened.
&gt;
&gt;I admit that my language was a bit salty. This is due to the fact my Brujah
&gt;persona talks like this frequently, and also because I was irritated that these
&gt;people were sleeping on channel.
&gt;
&gt;I then left for greener pastures for a few hours.
&gt;
&gt;I returned when I noticed that #anime! was beginning to fill with other people.
&gt;I logged in, with my nick still Brujah, having forgotten to change it.
&gt;
&gt;Immediately after logging, on [Starman] confronted my thusly:
&gt;
&gt;&lt;[Starman]&gt; Hey Brujah, remember this shit?
&gt;
&gt;and he played the segment of his log where I slapped him around, then made
&gt;my statement.
&gt;
&gt;I was then promptly kicked and banned, without even being given the opportunity
&gt;to present my case. I was then messaged by [Starman] as such:
&gt;
&gt;*[Starman]* I don't know who you are, but you aren't welcome here.
&gt;
&gt;*[Starman]* BTW, all your msg's are being ignored.
&gt;
&gt;Again, this is as close as I can remember it.
&gt;
&gt;I then attempted to communicate with other members of the channel, and finally
&gt;my friend Prisoner was able to gain ops and unban me. [Starman] had left by 
&gt;this time.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thinking this incident was over, I again attempted to join #anime! on 25 Dec, 
&gt;at app. 1:30 pm EST, as Casca. 
&gt;
&gt;I was kicked as soon as I joined. I rejoined, only to be kicked again. Then
&gt;I was banned.
&gt;
&gt;I then formed the alternate channel #anime in an attempt to begin communication
&gt;with [Starman]. I invited my friend Sonida to my channel and explained my case.
&gt;He agreed with me. I then invited [Starman] to join in an effort to solve this
&gt;dispute in a civilized manner. I was ignored.
&gt;
&gt;Sonida also tried, and was also ignored.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Therefore, all attempts at private resolution of this matter have failed. I 
&gt;have therefore decided to let popular opinion judge this matter. 
&gt;
&gt;I have mailed copies of this letter to everyone I know, and also posted a copy
&gt;to USENET rec.arts.anime in an effort to reach those whom I do not know.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My logic is this:
&gt;
&gt;IT WAS JUST A JOKE, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!
&gt;
&gt;Anybody who has seen me spar with Asrial on channel knows I do these actions
&gt;only in jest, and I have done far worse to her (I've dropped meteors on her, 
&gt;thrown her into acid, etc.). But we still remain friends. In fact, I only do
&gt;these to those people I feel I have known long enough to be able to goof around
&gt;with.
&gt;
&gt;I could understand this if I had insulted [Starman] or his mother, but for
&gt;virtual actions which harm no-one? For attempting to start a conversation on
&gt;a chat channel?  
&gt;
&gt;Doesn't this seem like over-reacting to you???
&gt;
&gt;Therefore, I bring this before a forum of all those who attend #anime!
&gt;regularly, semi-regularly, or those who have only joined once.
&gt;
&gt;I believe that [Starman] has over-reacted and is acting immaturely by kicking
&gt;and banning me without even attempting to work this out.
&gt;
&gt;I wish to have the ban dropped and be re-admitted to #anime!, for I feel I have
&gt;commited no crime.
&gt;
&gt;My e-mail address is bertishg@db.erau.edu
&gt;
&gt;[Starman]'s e-mail address is ~render1@teak.njit.edu
&gt;
&gt;Please do not hesitate to email me or post your feelings on the matter.
&gt;
&gt;I wish this problem resolved in a civilized, mature manner.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your time.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely, 
&gt; 
&gt;-- Casca

&gt;Actually, net-ettique should be observed.  Regardless of your persona, you have
&gt;no right to insult a person or make a joke of a person who happens to be idling
&gt;on an IRC channel.  I may not know a lot about IRC stuff, but as a MUCK Wizard,
&gt;I don't go around insulting people who are sleeping on their character.  Even
&gt;if you want to liven things up, you could leave a question and get a response
&gt;later.  What you do, gave Starman a justifiable reason to ignore you, because
&gt;you 'attacked' him without provocation and without justifyable means other than
&gt;him idling on a channel.  There is no law against him doing that, but there is
&gt;some common decency about being rude to a person who is not on-line.
