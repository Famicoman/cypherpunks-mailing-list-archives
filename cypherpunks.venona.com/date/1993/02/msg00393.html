&gt; &gt; Neither do I. But many of the users of anon.penet.fi are
&gt; &gt; not very computer-and-email-literate, and they have been using other
&gt; &gt; services, providing double-blind. Unfortunate, but too late to change now..
 &gt; .
&gt; 
&gt; Can you elaborate on those other services?  The Finnish remailer is the
&gt; only one I'm aware of.

The operating principles (and the early code) was copied from the
general service Karl Kleinpaste was running at godiva. There has been
two long-running servers serving some alt.* groups (alt.sex.*,
alt.sexual.abuse.recovery) for years.

&gt; Also, I'm confused about these "not very computer-and-email-literate"
&gt; users -- aren't they forced to use an X-Anon-Password header?

No. Not until now. And you can still post withaout it, and answer
anonymous mail without it, and of course set the password to "none", 
disabling passwords altogether.

&gt; I'm surprised there hasn't been more ruckus about the default
&gt; behavior.  There must be many folks whose identities have been
&gt; inadvertantly exposed.

I know, looking at the error messages and missent mail, that there would
have been hundreds of persons exposed without the default double-blind.

&gt; &gt; What we can do is to provide better ways for those who *are* computer
&gt; &gt; literate enough to use extra headers etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think this will help.  With my mail environment, I have to go
&gt; to lengths to send an anonymous message, concocting X-Anon-To and
&gt; X-Anon-Password headers.  It's worth the effort, since this helps to
&gt; preserve the secrecy of my pseudonymous identity.
&gt; 
&gt; But the first time I mess up, and send an unfettered message to an
&gt; anon.penet.fi client, I am unmasked.

No, once you set a password, the server won't let your message through
unless it's OK!

&gt; And I still don't understand how the unfettered message gets past the
&gt; X-Anon-Password filter.

Can you elaborate? I don't understand your question. Sorry, my english
isn't what it ought to be...

&gt; &gt; But in this case I feel the principle of least astonishment is overruled
&gt; &gt; by the principle of least risk of accidental exposure.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the risk of accidental exposure is heightened by the default
&gt; behavior of the Finnish remailer.  Maybe we're using the same words to
&gt; describe different things.

I beg to disagree.

&gt; &gt; I think that hornet's nest needed to be kicked. But I am also
&gt; &gt; disappointed that not enough people defend the need for anonymity in
&gt; &gt; places like news.admin.policy.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of us gave up on USENET policy long, long ago.  Personally, I stick
&gt; to the alt.* groups.

Right. Unfortunately. Because had you followed the discussion in
news.admin.policy you would have realized thet sticking your head in the
bush isn't going to help.
