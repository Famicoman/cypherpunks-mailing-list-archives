 BK&gt; Currently, Jock Gill is
 BK&gt; working in an office located in the Old Executive Office Building
 BK&gt; across the street from the White House.  At this point, he is
 BK&gt; working alone, without a staff.
 
This week's news indicates to me this will probably not improve.
 
 BK&gt; The White House itself employs a large
 BK&gt; staff to handle snail mail.
 
According to Monday night's news, this is from where these vaunted
"symbolic" 25% White House staff cuts will come.
 
 BK&gt; All things in their time.  Once the
 BK&gt; E-mail address was circulated together with the heading the "White
 BK&gt; House", everyone understandably believed a real system was up  
and
 BK&gt; running.
 
Yes, silly us...to say nothing of the "CLINTON" AOL address
 
 BK&gt; SUGGESTION:  Use the compuserve address you have judiciously,
 BK&gt; reserving it for absolutely vital contacts.
 
Oh, yes, _certainly_!  The _vital_ stuff should go into a nonexistant
system.  Naturally!
 
 BK&gt; Until such time that a
 BK&gt; real public access White house E-mail system is operational,
 BK&gt; consider relying on the traditional means of contacting the
 BK&gt; administration.  Given what they had to start with from the
 BK&gt; previous administration (scratch), I have every reason to expect
 BK&gt; that Jeff Eller and Jock Gill will work well--and as quickly  
as
 BK&gt; possible--to get an interactive system up and running.  But it  
will
 BK&gt; take time and patience.
 
Can anyone say, "VAPORWARE"?
 
 BK&gt; We can all help them achieve that effort
 BK&gt; best if we refrain from acting as if that non-existent system  
were
 BK&gt; already in place.  PLEASE HELP RELAY THIS CONTEXT AND SUGGESTION  
TO
 BK&gt; OTHER NETWORKS AND INDIVIDUALS.  Thanks.
 
Pass it around?  You bet.  It's f*cking _hilarious_!  My guess is  that
this gaffe will (or at least ought to) get Gill fired, assuming he
survives this "symbolic" staff downsizing.  I might add that nothing
could be more "symbolic" than the announcement that the cuts will  come
from those who actually respond to public input.  This "go away &amp;  don't
bother us" move on the part of the Clinton administration indicates  that
it obviously doesn't care _what_ America thinks.
.   There is a _bright side_ to this, however:  Would such an
indifferent administration spend resources trying to break our codes
when it doesn't care what we have to say anyway? 8-)
        JN
 
... We want information./You won't get it!/By hook or by crook, we  
_will_!
