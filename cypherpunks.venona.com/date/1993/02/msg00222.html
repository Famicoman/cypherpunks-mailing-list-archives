Kelly Goen expresses his outrage about the powerfreaks controlling the
police/spy/military agencies and encourages us to help spread encryption
and privacy technology to the groups figthing the government:

&gt;and company and changes in their tax status. These were and are the same
&gt;people suing the CIA over the La-penca bombing in honduras of
&gt;Journalists during the times of the contras in Nicgura. They while their
&gt;agenda is a good bit more political than ours have been the only ones for years
&gt;keeping the federal government at bay by lawsuit.
&gt;They need technical assistance, hookins to peacenet and Econet and general
&gt;help,
&gt;considering the widespread nature of the problem
&gt;we are fighting here maybe we should consider very actively
&gt;promultagating PGP and DC style anoymous networks among the
&gt;pease/political/human rights group. It would provide
&gt;convenient crypto-noise of PGP messgaes and greatly increase
&gt;the amount of money that the federal government has to spend investigating and
&gt;force them to spread themselves even more thinly...:)

I agree completely.

Even though I'm a libertarian (small "l") anarchocapitalist who happened to
vote for Perot (who has his defects!), I support some (but not all) of the
liberal agenda. Especially as regards getting the government out of our
lives. (And where I part company with many on the left is in the areas of
interference in free markets, anti-discrimination laws, and other statist
invasions of freedom and privacy.)

From the Cypherpunks I have met, either at the physical meetings or at
places like the Hackers Conference, I would say that about 50% are strongly
libertarian/anarchist, about 20% are liberal/leftist, and the rest I don't
know about.

What's the point? That we should follow Kelly's advice and make some
contacts with those in other movements. I suspect this may be happening
anyway, as Phil ZImmermann has said he wrote PGP partly to help peace
activists and the like.

Just my opinion, of course.
