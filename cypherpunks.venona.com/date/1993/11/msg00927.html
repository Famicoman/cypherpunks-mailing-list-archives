  &gt; From: baum@newton.apple.com (Allen J. Baum)
  &gt; But, there is one thing that is true about NSA's ability to crack it:
 &gt;  they won't give you cause to know whether they can or not.

This statement, like the following, is like a rich vein of 
valuable insight into the extra-technical aspects of the issue.

I found myself reading this next part over several times, and each pass
I found that I associated what I understood to other unspoken questions I have.

 &gt; e.g., if they can, and they read some mail of yours that you REALLY don't
 &gt; want them to read, they won't act on that information in such a manner that
 &gt; you can determine that they cracked the code for your message. They
 &gt; couldn't use it on a warrant, &amp; they couldn't testify as to its contents in
 &gt; court. To do so would advertise their capabilities, which is a no-no for
 &gt; them. (they might, of course, use that information to point people in the
 &gt; right direction so they can attribute information to an anonymous tip, but
 &gt; they have to be careful even there)

and thus revealing that if you become a target of genuine scorn from that
corner, it will operate from a position which is beyond accountability itself.

I think that Doug Barnes hit the nail on the head by pointing out
that sheer volume of stuff to filter through has the potential of 
affording us an edge.

 &gt; Even now, when it's pretty certain they could crack DES, you won't
 &gt; find them doing it for a law enforcement agency that asks; it gives away
 &gt; too much.
 
Anything you are *required* to keep secret, is more valuable to the 
*requiring agency* than to you.

Anything you are expected to accept on faith, can't be proven.
