&gt; Seriously, Mike's comments about cable being a "vaster wasteland" (a
&gt; nice EFF paraphrase of the famous FCC Commissioner's comments in the
&gt; 60s), is important.
 
I proudly take credit for "a vaster wasteland"--a phrase that occurred to
me in a flash of insight as I was doing a revision of the Open Platform
paper. I hope that if I repeat it a lot, it will become a
self-perpetuating meme.

&gt; Does anyone expect the NII will offer hard-core porn on its networks? 
 
In the long run, I expect it will, yes. On a properly designed NII, it
would be impossible to prevent, although of course anyone could bar it at
his or her home.

&gt; I don't know what the solution is, except that I'm naturally skeptical
&gt; about the government having _anything_ to do with it. (I've read the
&gt; CPSR pitch on NII and it scares the crap out of me. I've read the NII
&gt; articles in "Whole Earth Review" and elsewhere and I have the same
&gt; reaction. I've read the Open Platform proposal from EFF and find it
&gt; better, but still overly oriented toward government solutions.

Well, we knew we weren't going to please the purest Libertarians, but we
did try to make it palatable to them--after all, we have genuine
entrepreneurs on our Board of Directors, and they *do* believe in free
markets. Open Platform is our way of getting there from here.

&gt; Finally, I'm still trying to dig out the NII docs themselves, the ones
&gt; Tom Kalil has pointed us to.)
 
Did he say they were online? If this has been discussed before, I missed
it.

&gt; Strong crypto fundamentally collides with many of the stated public
&gt; policy goals surrounding the National Information Infrastructure.

I don't think it collides with EFF's public policy goals, although it may
collide with Tom Kalil's.
