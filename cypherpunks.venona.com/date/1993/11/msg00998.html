Here's a little document I threw together this morning to describe
the PGP multi-precision routines.  After reading about Henry Strickland's
work making TCL interfaces for various crypto functions, I've been
putting together a similar interface for PGP's mp library.  This is mostly
to teach myself TCL.  But I have developed some familiarity with PGP's
mp library as a result, so here is some information that will hopefully
be helpful.

PGP Multi-Precision Library Functions			Nov 26, 1993

Overview
========

PGP contains a multiple-precision math library to implement its
cryptographic functions.  This library is largely self-contained
and is suitable for use in other applications.

PGP's library is quite portable, working on both big- and little-
endian machines, as well as machines with both 16- and 32-bit integers.
It can be compiled in a mode which relies only on C code, or it can
be linked with an assembly language module customized for the particular
target machine to provide higher speed.  Assembly language modules
ship with PGP for a variety of targets.

The library uses fixed-size buffers for its calculations.  This means
there is a ceiling on the size of the numbers which can be used.  This
ceiling is determined at compile time, though, so special applications
can build the library with large ceilings if desired.

PGP's library and its source code in general is not public domain; it is
copyrighted by Philip Zimmermann, reachable at &lt;prz@acm.org&gt;.  PGP is
released under licensing terms which, I believe, allow use of the source
code for non-commercial purposes.  It would be a good idea to talk to Phil
before using the code in any product destined for widespread release.

The Library
===========

PGP's mp library is largely contained in the module mpilib.c.  This module
requires mpilib.h, usuals.h, and platform.h when it compiles.  The simplest
use of mpilib is to link it with your application, compiling with -D flag(s)
appropriate for your target machine.  (More information on the choice of
flags is below.)

Any module which will use the mp functions should also include mpilib.h.
All of these modules will also have to be compiled with the -D flag(s) used
by mpilib.c.

Compiling
=========

Compiling mpilib.c and other modules which include mpilib.h requires the
proper choice of -D flags.  The simplest case is if the target machine is
one of the ones for which explicit defines exist in platform.h.  In version
2.3a, these are: MSDOS, VMS, VAXC, mips, i386, sparc, mc68000, mc68020.
In each of these cases, an assembly-language module exists in the PGP
distribution to implement selected mp functions.

If you have one of these targets, add a -D flag for the symbol from the
above list to your compile command line.  For example, on an MS-DOS machine,
add -DMSDOS to the command line.  (Actually, in most cases these symbols
will be automatically defined by the target's compiler or pre-processor.
But it doesn't hurt to define them explicitly.)  Then you should also assemble
the corresponding assembly language file.  For MS-DOS it is 8086.asm;
the proper choice for the other targets should be obvious from the filenames.
Link the assembly language object module along with mpilib's object module
into your application.

If you don't have one of these targets, mpilib.c can be built in a "portable"
mode which will implement all functions in C.  To do this, define
-DPORTABLE and -DMPORTABLE on the command line.  In addition, if you are on
a big-endian machine (such as a sparc or 68000-based machine), you must
define -DHIGHFIRST as well.  Little-endian machines don't need an explicit
define for endianness.

In portable mode, PGP will default to 16-bit units.  If your target has
32-bit ints, you can define -DUNIT32 to get considerably more efficient
code.

Remember that these defines must be added to all modules which include
mpilib.h, in addition to mpilib.c.  (Note: in the PGP makefile you may
also see other defines, -DDYN_ALLOC and -DSMALL_MEM.  These are not relevant
to the mp library and are not necessary for this application.)

**** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ****

PGP has many alternate forms of multiple-precision multiplication and
division; the appropriate one is chosen based on your particular machine.
The default choice is SMITH, because that is usually the fastest.  However,
the SMITH algorithm has the deficiency that it does not (in version 2.3a)
work correctly for small numbers.  (This is not a problem for PGP because
it works with large numbers of hundreds of bits.  But for a general-purpose
library it is not adequate.)

A better choice is UPTON for the purposes of a general-purpose library.
You should edit mpilib.h to have it define UPTON instead of SMITH for your
particular target architecture if you are using one of the pre-defined
targets.  If you are building with -DPORTABLE, you can either edit mpilib.h
to change the default choice, or you can define -DUPTON on the command line.

Using the Library
=================

Before use, the MP library must be initialized.  Presently the only
initialization needed is to set the precision value, which tells how many
"units" (a unit is typically an int on the target machine) long the
fixed-size mp buffers are.  This is done by calling:

	set_precision (MAX_UNIT_PRECISION);

To use the mp library, include mpilib.h in your module.  Multi-precision
variables should be declared as follows:

	unit temp[MAX_UNIT_PRECISION];

This declares a variable "temp" suitable for holding a multi-precision
value.  I like to do:

	typedef unit unitarr[MAX_UNIT_PRECISION];
	unitarr temp;

which has the same effect.

MP variables may either be declared locally or as global variables as with
other types of C variables.

PGP's mp library functions need to be called with the address of a mp
variable.  Since mp variables are declared as arrays in C, this means
you can just pass the variable name.  For example, to add x2 to x1, you
could do:

	unitarr x1, x2;
	mp_add (x1, x2);

mpilib.h defines unitptr as a pointer to a unit.  If you write functions
which take MP values as parameters these should be declared as unitptr's.
For example, a function to add three numbers and return a result might be:

void mp_add3 (unitptr rslt, unitptr arg1, unitptr arg2, unitptr arg3)
{
	mp_move (rslt, arg1);
	mp_add (rslt, arg2);
	mp_add (rslt, arg3);
}

Make sure you don't make the mistake of declaring a local and global variables
as unitptrs and passing them to mp functions.  You need to allocate space
for them by declaring them as unit arrays.

Library Functions
=================

Most of the library functions are conceptually simple.  The one exception
is modular multiplication.  This performs the function A*B mod M.  PGP
requires this to be done via two calls.  First you tell it the modulus
M with the stage_modulus call.  Then you do the multiplication with
mp_modmult.  This is code to do rslt = arg1*arg2 mod m:

	unitarr rslt, arg1, arg2, m;
	stage_modulus (m);
	mp_modmult(rslt, arg1, arg2);

If you are doing a series of multiplications with the same modulus you
can call stage_modulus just once and then call mp_modmult repeatedly.
Be aware that mp_modexp calls stage_modulus internally so that function
will overwrite the saved modulus value.

PGP is missing a few functions that you would expect.  It does not have
modular addition and subtraction.  These should basically do A+B and then
test for the range 0..(M-1), and if out of range add or subtract M once
to bring it back into range.  Perhaps these will be added to a future version
of PGP.

Some mp functions have parameters that are both inputs and outputs (e.g.
mp_inc(r) increments r).  In other cases, though, the inputs are separate
from the outputs.  In those cases you should not pass the same variable
as both an input and an output parameter.  For example, you should not do
mp_mult (a, a, b) to get a *= b, because a is being used as both an input
and an output parameter.  Instead, you should do mp_mult (temp, a, b) and
then mp_move (a, temp).

Here are some useful PGP mpilib functions and what they do.  The MP numbers
are r, r1, r2, etc; non-MP integers are i, j, etc.


Non-modular MP functions:

mp_move(r1,r2)			r1 = r2

mp_add(r1,r2) 			r1 += r2

mp_sub(r1,r2)			r1 -= r2

mp_compare(r1,r2)		-1,0,or 1 depending on (r1&lt;r2),(r1=r2),(r1&gt;r2)

mp_mult(r1,r2,r3)		r1 = r2 * r3;

mp_udiv(rem,rquot,rdend,rdor)	unsigned rdend/rdor;rem=remainder,rquot=quotient

mp_div(rem,rquot,rdend,rdor)	signed rdend/rdor; rem=remainder, rquot=quotient

mp_mod(rem,rdend,rdor)		rem = rdend % rdor  (unsigned)

mp_abs(r)			r = absolute value of r

mp_inc(r)			r += 1

mp_dec(r)			r -= 1

mp_neg(r)			r = -r

mp_square(r1,r2)		r1 = r2 * r2

msub(r,r1)			if (r&gt;=r1) r -= r1


Modular mp functions:

stage_modulus(rm)		set rm as modulus for mp_modmult

mp_modmult(rslt,r1,r2)		rslt = r1 * r2 mod stage_modulus value

mp_modsquare(r1,r2)		r1 = r2 * r2 mod stage_modulus value

mp_modexp(rslt,r1,r2,rm)	rslt = (r1 to the power r2) mod rm


MP/Integer interface functions:

mp_init(r,i)			mp value r = integer value i

mp_burn(r)			r = 0  (for erasing sensitive data in memory)

testeq(r,i)			True if mp value r == integer value i

testne(r,i)			True if mp value r != integer value i

testge(r,i)			True if mp value r &gt;= integer value i

testle(r,i)			True if mp value r &lt;= integer value i

significance(r)			returns number of significant units in r

mp_shortdiv(rquot,rdend,i)	rdend/i; rquot=quotient, returns int remainder

mp_shortmod(rdend,i)		returns rdend % i  (unsigned)


I/O of MP Values
================

The PGP module mpiio.c has some routines for I/O of mp values.  This module
includes pgp.h (which includes a lot more files) but that is not really
necessary.  I advise commenting out the include of pgp.h in that module.
Then you will only need to add mpiio.c and mpiio.h to your program
directory.

To get access to the more general I/O functions in mpiio.c you must compile
it with -DDEBUG.  This will allow you to call:

str2reg(r,str)			Convert string str to mp value r

The string passed to str2reg will be assumed to be in decimal.  To pass
a hex string it must end in 'h'; binary strings should end in 'b', and
octal strings in 'o'.  Decimal strings may optionally end in '.'.  (These
terminating characters could be added by a pass before str2reg is called
if you don't want to require them from the user or file.)

display_in_base(str,r,irad)	Display string r in base irad, preceded by str

This will print mp value r on standard out, using base irad.  It will
precede it by the string str.

mp_display(str,r)		Display string r in hex, preceded by str

This always displays in hex, and is somewhat faster than display_in_base.

One function which is lacking is something to convert an mp value to a
string in memory.  display_in_base and mp_display always write to standard
output.  These routines can be fairly easily modified to output to an
incrementing pointer (*bp++) to get this effect if necessary. 

Other PGP MP Functions
======================

The module genprime.c has several useful mp functions.  Unfortunately,
since the focus of this module is generating PGP random keys, it has
links to other parts of PGP, such as the random number generation.  It
is probably best to extract source routines from this module on a
selective basis.  Among the routines which would be of general use are:

mp_gcd(rslt,r1,r2)		rslt = greatest common divisor of r1 and r2
mp_inv(rslt,r1,r2)		Compute rslt such that rslt*r1 mod r2 is 1
nextprime(r)			Finds the next prime above r, returns in r
slowtest(r)			True if r is a probable prime
primetest(r)			Sieve then slowtest r, true if probable prime

nextprime is fast, using a combination of sieving and probabilistic
primality testing.  It is what is used by PGP for its RSA key generation.
slowtest is used by nextprime; it applies the Fermat test with the first
four primes as test values.  primetest first checks r against a list of
small primes for divisibility, then calls slowtest to test it.

There are also some other calls in mpilib.c which I did not document
above.  They are somewhat lower-level, mostly, but they might be useful
for some purposes.  A little study of the code will reveal these routines.
