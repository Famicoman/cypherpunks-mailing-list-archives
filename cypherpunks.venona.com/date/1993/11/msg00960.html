Hey, I heard about a new mailing list some people here may be
interested in. Pseudospoofers need not apply. (If you do, fair warning,
you will be hunted down...)

===cut=here===


Postings to everyone on the cypherwonks list go to 
cypherwonks@Lists.EUnet.fi.

Commands to the MajorDomo mail server go to &lt;Majordomo@Lists.EUnet.fi&gt;
in the message body. Basic commands are HELP, INFO, SUBSCRIBE, etc.

The Cypherwonk Charter, by L. Detweiler, Cypherwonk Janitor

The cypherwonks are a splinter group from the cypherpunks also
interested in promoting and implementing cryptographic technology.
However, we have unique ideas on how to successfully implement these
radical new capabilities to ensure privacy without encouraging criminal
behaviors like forgery and `online predation'. We are also interested
in a far more ambitious goal of `technological progress' that
transcends a mere obsession with privacy and anonymity. The cypherwonks
believe that many aspects of a identification and government are
necessary and crucial for any social stability (particularly related to
judicial and law enforcement systems), and are quite alarmed at talk
about a `cryptoanarchy' resulting from the mere implementation of
software protocols -- although we realize that radical new forms of
government may appear with these new technologies, embodied in one term
`Electronic Democracy'.

We believe that while sometimes the `majority' can become a `tyranny',
in general the idea of voting as a civilized way of resolving proposals
and `one person, one vote' are sacred, and we are interested in
implementing systems that promote interaction and collaboration among
motivated and enthusiastic members, whether within the cypherwonk
organization or within their nations (cypherwonks, of course, try to
think free of local prejudices, and globally).

Cypherwonks understand that *trust* and *honesty* are inherent in all
human endeavors, *particularly* communication. We recognize that people
trust others not to reveal our private email unless given permission,
we trust others not to use information from our mail or about their
identities to adverse aims, we trust that systems delivering mail will
not be corrupted by criminals, or if they get caught there will be
serious consequences, and many other explicit and implicit variations.
We know that there are many ingenious ways of minimizing the amount of
trust required in unknown components such as with the use of
cryptography or pseudonyms, and we seek passionately to invent and use
them, but at the root level, email is an exchange between human beings
who trust each other. Therefore, we hold a sense of ethics and morality
in strong reverence, and even though we're not always precisely sure
what they entail, we know that they exist and we strive for the right
ideal. We abhor the idea that `it's not wrong if you can get away with
it' or other variations of moral relativism. We also subscribe to the
idea that if you breach ethics, you should be prepared to forfeit some 
rights, like your `right to privacy'.

Cypherwonks are also extremely interested in promoting and implementing
`digital cash', but believe that while invariably the state's taxes
tend to become burdensome, few civilized, technological societies are
free of them, and certainly we do not advocate tax evasion, `black
marketeering', or any other subversive or illegal activities through
cryptographic techniques, and even beyond this we seek design protocols
that discourage these subversive aims in general, because of their
toxic, fragmentary effect on social unity.

Cypherwonks recognize that our mailing list is extremely critical in
coordinating our movement and our fellow members. It is our central
nervous system. While the list is informal, we demand a professional
atmosphere, and will privately object to people who are publicly rude
or belligerent. But we are also extremely careful about what we say to
each other in private, because people can be extremely influenced by
what they receive in mail. We would be aghast and horrified to find
that somebody viciously criticized someone in private mail based on
public postings, for example. We place high value on being courteous to
each other and minimizing disagreement where possible, forging
consensus, and the art of diplomacy in surmounting political barriers.
We trust each other on the list and in personal email. We wish to have
an open, uplifting, inspiring, honest, representative, polite,
respectful, egalitarian dialogue. We will never use the mailing list
for personal or selfish reasons -- we strive to serve our fellow
cypherwonks through our postings. We are what we claim to be. We abhor
secrecy, `security through obscurity', and conspirational cliques.

Cypherwonks are extremely interested in promoting some forms of
anonymity. However, we do not necessarily believe that others are
required to read anonymous postings. To the contrary, we believe that
the individual should have the tools and freedom to filter his or her
own mail based on real identities. In particular, we condemn the
practice of `pseudospoofing,' the dangerous deception where a person
builds up a pseudonym and misrepresents it as being that of a real
person's identity. We police each other on the list to prevent it, and
require a promise that our members refrain from it. While our trust can
be betrayed, only those that are honest are true cypherwonks, and
anyone who betrays our trust we consider a dishonest hypocrite, or worse, 
a traitor.

Cypherwonks are extremely interested in building tangible systems.
Engineers who love to discuss the nitty-gritty details of some scheme
are at home on the cypherwonks list. We like to impress each other with
our knowledge but at the same time state it in relevant and humble
terms. We are not trying to win popularity contests with our postings.
We are trying to accomplish ambitious endeavors. We are especially
ecstatic to make connections with other cypherwonks interested in the
same projects we are, and cooperating to build useful tools. We like to
give status reports of our intermittent real-world meetings and
progress to other cypherwonks. We do this to inspire and encourage
others, not to assuage our egos or flaunt our power. We recognize that
this is the true spirit of the Internet embodies in the volunteerism
that build the impressive RFC and FAQ repositories. In fact, we are
very fond of writing RFCs and FAQs. We keep track of all the things we
have accomplished, and are very proud of this group resume, and delight
in adding new items.

The Cypherwonks are more inclusive than exclusive. We try to
accommodate the interests of others. We consider it a high crime to
`flame newbies'. In fact, we go out of our way to encourage greet new
members with smiles in email. We especially like to have reporters on
the list, and treat them like royalty. But we also make sure that no
one is hogging the spotlight. We try to match up reporters with
different people on the list. Some people are naturally `leaders',
particularly the list moderator J. Helsingius, but in general we don't
lionize or deify anyone. The greatest cypherwonk is always the last
person who posted the most interesting, relevant, and useful article.

While we thrive on the Internet, and greatly admire the system, we also
realize the structure of the Internet is evolving and growing. We tend
to distrust `authorities' regulating the Internet, but at the same time
we recognize that the Internet exists and is popular because of a
strong community feeling with a `netiquette' that places a strong taboo
on things like censorship, cracking, and pseudospoofing and a strong
interest in individual effort and innovation.  In short, we are
interested in `civilizing cyberspace' with the powerful new
technological tools like cryptography and digital cash that are
available but unimplemented. We believe that the current Internet is a
bit raw and untamed in places, like a frontier, and just a `glimmer in
the eye' of future cyberspace, and we seek to smooth out the rough
spots, build elaborate and hospitable castles to live in, and invite
all of humanity here to join us for a party. 

(In case you are wondering, the word `wonk' is slang for a `meticulous 
detail person'.)

The Cypherwonk Code of Ethics (Including Pseudospoofing and Privacy)
By L. Detweiler, Cypherwonk janitor

Cypherwonks owe no courtesy to someone who forfeits any expectation of
respect from atrocious misbehavior. This is as simple as the maxim, 
if you are a criminal you forfeit your `rights' in a civilized society.

If you mailbomb a cypherwonk, you have forfeited your `right to 
privacy'. 

If you email a cypherwonk's postmaster or colleagues in an attempt to 
censor or intimidate a cypherwonk, especially before consulting that
cypherwonk, but not necessarily, you have forfeited your `right to 
privacy'. 

If you lie to a cypherwonk, you have forfeited your `right to privacy'. 

If you fail to adequately respond to personal accusations of impropriety 
or criminality, especially meeting them with evasion or stonewalling, you 
have forfeited your `right to privacy'.

If you have ever sent a cypherwonk mail under a pseudoanonymous identity, 
you have forfeited your `right to privacy' -- under ALL your pseudonyms 
and identities. 

If you advocate violations of ethical or legal behavior to a cypherwonk, 
you forfeit your `right to privacy'.

Cypherwonks, even highly reputable ones, may attempt to shame you into
embarrassment or repentance for violations of ethical behavior by 
ridiculing you in front of people who appear to be your friends and 
community, if all other measures have failed. In extreme cases, even 
this may be ineffective, but if you have no shame, you have no humanity.

List topics (not exhaustive)

-Projects (secure phones, etc.)
-Cryptographic techniques (RSA etc.)
-Anonymity
-International news events in privacy/anonymity
-Identity issues such as databases and pseudospoofing
-Clipper
-real world meetings (others and our own)
-etc.

Posting guidelines: we wish to minimize the number of postings to the
list so as to attract the busy, influential people that get things done. Please 
refine your postings highly. We especially appreciate the consolodation
of topics with summaries, `tables of contents', headings, etc. where
appropriate. At all times, we seek to build consensus and look down on
grouchy postings that do nothing but criticize. The list should be 
regarded as a stepping stone to `getting things done' or `resolving 
conflicts' in email.

The Cypherwonk Resume

J. Helsingius has built the most popular and global anonymity server on 
the Internet, with thousands of active users daily.

L. Detweiler has compiled a wide variety of FAQs on Internet subjects.

(updates to ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu)

* * *

Most Wanted List

- key servers that are dedicated only to `true identities'. People who 
submit their keys promise the keys are that of their real identities and 
that no one else will ever post under their identities. Penalty is 
public exposure and stigma if caught. The protocols might also include
mechanisms for `challenges' and `resolutions'.

- reputation based mailing list software. One idea: people rate each other's
postings in different categories. Server tracks everyone's ratings. People
can screen mail based on accrued credit.

- electronic democracy software (especially tied to reputations). 
protocols for propositions, resolutions, voting, etc.

- other identity servers to prevent pseudospoofing. possibly hooking up 
with existing government databases.

- pseudonymity servers like anon.penet.fi with public key encryption.

- support of the Bunyip project for automated Internet resource 
tracking, including mailing lists.

- support for distributed hypertext systems and protocols like XMosaic.

- resume &amp; reputation servers. a very premature idea, but these would 
help track people's accomplishments and reputations in different forums,
perhaps even by cross indexing their postings.
