Page 93:  "Blind Signatures," first line.  "An essential
in all" should be "An essential feature in all".

Page 98:  First paragraph after protocol, fourth line. 
"to determine the DES key with the other encrypted
message" should be "to determine the DES key that the
other encrypted message was encrypted in."

Page 131:  Fifth paragraph.  "each capable of checking
265 million keys" should be "each capable of checking
256 million keys".

Page 141:  "Reduced Keyspaces," last sentence.  "don't

short keys to stand up".

Page 157:  Figure 8.2.  "IO" should be "IV".

Page 159:  Figure 8.3.  "IO" should be "IV".

Page 164:  Figure 8.7.  "IO" should be "IV".

Page 165:  Last equation.  There should be a "(P)" at
the end of that equation.

Page 178:  Figure 8.20.  In "Node 2", the subscripts
should be "D_2" and "E_3".

Page 191:  First paragraph.  "EBCDIC" should be
"BAUDOT".

Page 198:  Fourth paragraph from bottom, second
sentence.  "If a and b are positive and a is less than n,
you can think of a as the remainder of b when divided
by n" should be "If a and b are positive and b is less
than n, you can think of b as the remainder of a when
divided by n".

Page 199:  Middle of the page.  In the sentence
"Calculating the power of a number modulo a number",
a should not be italicized.

Page 202:  Middle of the page.  In the sentence "Now,
how do you go about finding the inverse of a modulo

Equipment," first line.  "As part of the standard, the
DES NIST" should be "As part of the DES standard,
NIST"

Page 228:  Fourth paragraph, last line.  "0 to 16"
should be 0 to 15".

Page 229:  Fifth paragraph should read:  "For example,
assume that the input to the sixth S-box (that is, bits 31
through 36 of the XOR function) are 110010.  The first
and last bits combine to form 10, which corresponds to
row 3 of the sixth S-box.  The middle four bits
combine to form 1001, which corresponds to column 9
of the same S-box.  The entry under row 3, column 9
of S-box 6 is 0.  (Remember, we count rows and
columns from 0, and not from 1.)  The value 0000 is
substituted for 110010.

Page 238:  Last line before "Additional Results." 
"NSA" should be "IBM".

Page 238:  "Differential Cryptanalysis," third
paragraph.  "(1/16)^2" should be "(14/16)^2" and
"5%" should be "77%".

Page 250:  The two functions should be:
   S_0(a,b) = rotate left 2 bits (a+b) mod 256)
   S_1(a,b) = rotate left 2 bits (a+b+1) mod 256)
Note the difference in parentheses.

four 8-bit substrings, a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4.

Page 251:  Figure 11.6.  The definitions for S_0 and
S_1 are incorrect.  See corrections from previous page.

should run from the symbol where Z_5 is multiplied
with the intermediate result to the addition symbol
directly to the right.

Page 265:  Figure 11.10.  There is a line missing.  It
should run from the symbol where Z_5 is multiplied
with the intermediate result to the addition symbol
directly to the right.

has been broken.  Do not use this algorithm.

Page 267:  Sixth line from bottom.  Footnote should be
"[255]".

Page 269:  "Skipjack."  First paragraph.  Footnote
should be "[654]".

Page 271:  Middle of the page.  "(for example, MD2,
MD5, Snefru" should be "(for example, MD2, MD4,
Snefru".

Page 272:  Second to last line.  "But it is be analyzed"

Page 306:  Fourth paragraph.  Delete the word
"cryptographers".

Page 307:  "Description of the Algorithm."  "p = a
prime number 2^L bits long" should be "p = a prime
number L bits long".

Page 330:  Definitions of FF, GG, HH, and II.  In all
of them, "a = b +" should be "a = a +".

Page 347:  Second paragraph.  "(For example, m
should be chosen to be a prime number.)" should be
"(For example, c and m should be relatively prime.)"

Page 351:  Second line of text.  "they hold current"
should be "they hold the current".

Page 353:  Second paragraph.  "are often used from
stream ciphers" should be "are often used for stream
ciphers".

Page 356:  Source code.  "ShiftRegister =
(ShiftRegister ^ (mask &gt;&gt; 1))" should be

A" and vice versa.  The second "a(t+n-1)" should be
"a(t+n)", and the second "b(t+n-1)" should be
"b(t+n)".

Page 365:  "Blum-Micali Generator."  In the equation,
"x_i" should be an exponent, not a subscript.

Page 391:  Second protocol, step (1).  "in his
implementation of DES" should be "in his
implementation of DSS".

Page 436:  "Pretty Good Privacy."  Third paragraph. 
Delete third sentence.

Page 437:  "Clipper."  Second paragraph:  foonote
should be "[473]".  Fourth paragraph:  footnotes should
be "[473,654,876,271,57]".

Page 438:  Middle of page:  footnote should be
"[654]".  "Capstone," first paragaph:  footnote should
be "[655]".
