Um, not really.  It is usually caused by sexual abuse and/or severe 
psycological trauma.  When someone is abused repeatedly, they will sometimes 
create another personality to take the abuse so that they don't have to.  The 
problem is that it becomes an uncontrolled escape mechanism for dealing with 
problems, which can be very damaging.  Kinda weird tho when you think about 
it.
