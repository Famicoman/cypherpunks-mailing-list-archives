S.Boxx:
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt; nobody is interested in preventing pseudospoofing here. the
&gt; people who have most maneuvered themselves into a position to aid
&gt; future cyberspace are instead constraining it. that's the point, isn't
&gt; it? gosh, how could I have been so blind...

T.C.May:
&gt;I think its because we don't see pseudospoofing as a "danger" like you
&gt;do.  Personally, I consider it a necessity.  I like being able to hide
&gt;behind an anonymous identity (not that I do, mind you).  I don't see
&gt;pseudospoofing as "constraining".  On the contrary, I see it as
&gt;freeing us.

E.Hughes, on Pseudospoofing software
&gt;No the software isn't mine, but I consider myself it's God Father.
&gt;Tim May and I were talking about this a long
&gt;time, and he just beat me to learning enough PERL to write the thing.
&gt;But I'd like to think that the two of us did most all of the design of
&gt;it.  So, in a way, it is my software.

Nick Szabo:
&gt;As an example, look at Ender's Game, where Ender's brother and sister
&gt;get on the net under pseudonyms, and get treated just like everyone
&gt;else.  There is no biases.  People are judged on their actions and
&gt;words, not by who they are, how old they are, what they look like, or
&gt;anything like that.  Maybe you are blind, I don't know.  I've never
&gt;met you.

Arthur Chandler:
&gt;And, as I said, it is not the job of the Keyserver to provide any sort
&gt;of policy.  The job of the Keyserver is to distribute keys.  Nothing
&gt;more.  Nothing less.  The job of identifying True Names is solely a
&gt;job for Digital Signatures, not a job for the Keyserver.  

Jamie Dinkelacker:
&gt;I oppose using it in a bogus fashion because the software is not
&gt;designed for such a use, there is absolutely no protection for it (any
&gt;key can be added), because I, and all the other Keyserver admins,
&gt;believe that all the keyservers should be interconnected, and because
&gt;I feel the job for determining a True Name on a key is a job for
&gt;Digital Signatures, not for the Keyserver.  

Perry Metzger:
&gt;I am a cypherpunk.  I don't believe in trusting something on faith
&gt;alone, but you seem to be asking for that.  There is no way to protect
&gt;such a reckless use of the Keyserver.  The only way to provide a
&gt;secure way for True Names is to Cryptographically identify them.

Hal Finney:
&gt;So, Mr. Detweiler, why do you oppose using Digital Signatures to
&gt;verify True Names?  I mean, besides that you consider yourself a
&gt;Cypherpunk? ;-)
