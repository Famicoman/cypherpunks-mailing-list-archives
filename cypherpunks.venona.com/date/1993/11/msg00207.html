Cyphertentacles,

A couple of you have asked about "Wired" and the availability of the
new issue, 1.6. Especially as the first "monthly" issue, 1.5, has only
been out a few weeks. (And it mentions a strange thing called
"BlackNet" on page 32, as sharp observers have noted.)

I've been told by Sandy Sandfort that the issue is not yet on the
newstands, and may not even be sent out to contributor and subscribers
for a couple more weeks....so no point in looking for it now. How'd I
get one, then?

Well, we found hundred of copies of 1.6 on our dinner tables Friday
night at the Hackers Conference. The FinCEN article that I mentioned
was thus a fine preparation for the Crypto panel later that evening.

Speaking of which, it went quite well. Personally, I liked the panels
on "agents and agoric computing," the talk on "algorithmic investing,"
and the demoes of some truly impressive virtual reality work at Sun.
Maybe the crypto stuff is old hat to me. 

But lots of folks were extremely interested, many even claiming it was
their favorite panel. 

The panelists were Peter Honeyman, Phil Karn, Eric Hughes, Mike
Godwin, and John Draper, with me nominally as the moderator.

A "BOF" ("birds of a feather," a SIG by another name) session was held
in the early hours of Saturday, with even more interest. We may get
another wave of new members on the list.
