What follows is a private e-mail exchange with Burt Kaliski (posted with
his permission), where he clarifies the 'hole in MD5' and shows that it
does not afford the attack I described previously.

Mike Ingle:
  &gt;Recently there was a message here about MD5 having a hole in it.
  &gt;Maybe this is what the person was talking about...

Bruce Schneier:
  [ describes Bart Preneel's Ph.D. thesis, which cites the work of
  den Boer and Bosselaer ]

Burt Kaliski:
  [ a LaTeX document noting the implications, or lack thereof, of den Boer
  and Bosselaers' work ]

Scott Collins:
  [ describes an attack on (e.g.) Bellcore's timestamp system; wonders
  if den Boer and Bosselaers' work makes this attack possible ]

Burt Kaliski (private response):
  &gt;When operating on single blocks, MD5 computes a function z = f(x,y0), 
  &gt;where x is the 512-bit message block, y0 is a fixed 128-bit value, and 
  &gt;z is the 128-bit message digest.
  &gt;
  &gt;den Boer and Bosselaers found a way to construct a triple (x,y1,y2) 
  &gt;such that f(x,y1) = f(x,y2). The y1 and y2 values are not the same as 
  &gt;the fixed y0, so clearly this is different than an MD5 collision, 
  &gt;which would have different message blocks.
  &gt;
  &gt;I'm not sure how this relates to the attack you have in mind, although 
  &gt;I'd be interested in more details. Also, the attack you describe is 
  &gt;"after-the-fact" in the sense that the target value h_N is already 
  &gt;published. To forge a time-stamp at that point, what I need is not a 
  &gt;collision, but an inversion. (I have to find something that hashes to 
  &gt;h_N.) Collisions play a greater role "before-the-fact," where I might 
  &gt;give Eve something to sign, where I happen to know another message 
  &gt;with the same digest.

Scott Collins:
  &gt; [ ... ]
  &gt;
  &gt;Ahh. This is not (even close to) a big enough foothold to support my 
  &gt;attack.  :-)
  &gt;
  &gt; [ ... ]
  &gt;
  &gt;The attack does, in fact, require inversion.  Since the verifier can't 
  &gt;compare the depth of the alleged hash tree to the actual one, the attack is 
  &gt;still possible even when only _some_ inversions are possible, as long as 
  &gt;the attacker can find one along the actual path to the root (the degenerate 
  &gt;case being when the attacker can find an inversion for the root itself).
  &gt;
  &gt;The attack only came to mind because the the depth cannot be verified, and 
  &gt;so the attacker is not limited in the number of steps (in case she can only 
  &gt;find inversions of a special form); the intermediate hash values are all of 
  &gt;minimal size; the intermediate hash values are expected to be 'random', and 
  &gt;so there is no constraint requiring human-readable inversions.  Thus, it 
  &gt;seemed that if an the hash could be usefully inverted, this would be the 
  &gt;situation that allowed it.
  &gt;
  &gt;Thanks for the clarification.  May I repost your answer, or at least _this_ 
  &gt;message which quotes it, to the original distribution list of my question?
