Here is some information about LanCrypto, a Russian public-key
encryption program. This one sounds interesting.

From:   IN%"alex@crypto.msk.su" 20-OCT-1993 14:36:24.72


                               CRYPTO  BANK

            System of programms of encryption (decryption) of files


             To work all users must have the files:

        afina.exe - programm for generation of new public and secret keys
        afinall.exe - programm for creation of a common list of public keys
        vesta.exe - programm for encryption/decryption of file
        NNNNN.pbl - file contains a new public key,NNNNN is a number of user
        secret.new - file contains a new secret key
        secret.key - file contains an old secret key


         FIRST stage. Generation of new secret and public keys by user

             User runs prigramm:

                                   afina.exe

             A message apears on the screen:

                                 Press any keys


             User begins to strike rand set of  keys.A  new  secret  key
        writes to floppy diskette A to file sekret.new.
             A public key writes to the current directory  in  the  file
        NNNNNN.pbl (NNNNNN is a number of user).
             If you want to write  your  secret  key  on  hard  disk  in
        current directory you run:

                                  afina.exe /k

             Then all  users  of sistem exchange their public keys(files
        NNNNNN.pbl.).We recommend thate users organise  a  CENTER  .(The
        CENTER  collects all public keys,creates a common list of public
        keys and sends it to users.)


           SECOND stage. Creation and sending a list of public keys.

             After exchanging  of  the files NNNNNN.pbl,  user( CENTER )
        has the files, received from his partners:

               N1.pbl
               N2.pbl
               ...
               NM.pbl

             To create common list of public keys ,  user( CENTER ) runs
        the programm

                    afinall.exe . (dot in the end)

             if files * .pbl lokate in current directory

                               afinall.exe [path]

             if files *.pbl lokate in other directory.
             Programm creates  a  common  list and writes it to the file
        publall.key.


                       THIRD stage. Encrypting of a file.


             If user number NNNNN encrypts file for  user  number  LLLLL
        ,user number NNNNN runs :

          vesta.exe  [path\]file_name  LLLLLL  [\k]                (1)

             (\k is  a parametre,  the programm vesta.exe finds a secret
        key  in   a   current   directory,   ;if   you   run   vesta.exe
        [path\]file_name  LLLLLL  ,the programm vesta.exe finds a secret
        key in floppy diskette )
             During the  process  of its work vesta.exe takes the secret
        key of user number NNNNN (from current directory(if you use  \k)
        or  from  ffloppy diskette),  takes the public key of user LLLLL
        (from file publall.key).Useing a secret key of user NNNNN and  a
        public  key  of  user  LLLLL  vesta.exe  creats  a common secret
        key.Then vesta.exe generates a rand session  key,useing  it  and
        the  comman secret key vesta.exe creats a secret session key and
        encrypts the file.  The rand session key is not secret ant it is
        added to the file.


                       FORTH stage. Decrypting of a file


             Encrypted file may be decrypted by two ways:
             1. by user NNNNN, if he repeats programm (1);
             2. by user LLLLL, if he runs :

                    vesta.exe  [path\]file_name NNNNN  [\k]


              EXAMPLE 1 ( We have user 000(CENTER)  and user 001):


             User 001  runs  afina.exe  \k.User 001 has files secret.new
        and 001.pbl in the current directory.
             User 001 sends 001.pbl to user 000(CENTR).
             User 000 runs afina.exe \k.User 000  has  files  secret.new
        and 000.pbl .User 000 receivs a file 001.pbl.He has:

                afinall.exe
                000.pbl
                001.pbl

             User 000 runs afinall.exe . (dot in the end ).He has:

                afinall.exe
                000.pbl
                001.pbl
                publall.key

             The file publall.key user 000(CENTER) sends to user 001.

                User 000 has :                !      User 001 has :
                                              !
                      vesta.exe               !      vesta.exe
                      publall.key             !      publall.key
                      000.pbl                 !      001.pbl
                      secret.key              !      secret.key
                      secret.new              !      secret.new
                      test0.txt

             User 000 encrypts file test.txt for user 001 .He runs :

                           vesta.exe test0.txt 001 /k

             User 001 receivs test0.txt and decrypts it :

                           vesta.exe test0.txt 000 /k


             User 001 encrypts file test1.txt for user 000.He runs :

                           vesta.exe test.txt1 000 /k

             User 000 receivs test1.txt and decrypts it:

                           vesta.exe test1.txt 001 /k



                  SIGNING AND CHECKING  OF ELECTRONIC MESSAGE

          To sign a message you must do:
                      sign.exe file
          To check yoy must do:
                      notary.exe file


          NOTALL.EXE  makes men.cat(list of all public keys of signatures )

                      PUBLIC KEY GENERATION SYSTEM


     AFINA is  a unique package of programs for automatic generation
of a common private key for a specific commynication session  between
two users.

     AFINA canbe  used  in  any  data   transmission   system   with
cryptographical protection.  It  rules  out  the  need  for  a  prior
distribution of private keys to users.


    AFINA uses  the  best  methods of public key generation between
two users that  have  been  tested  and  widely  aookied  by  Western
governments and commercial ventyres.

     Oyr original algorithm and programs have a four-fold increase in
the speed of generating a public  key  compared  to  the  best  known
standards while also improving data protection 100-fold.

     Having purchased  the  AFINA  program,  you  will  become fully
independent of  any  key  supplying  service.  AFINA   automatically
generates common private key for communication sessions with any user
in several seconds. You can choose the key length.

     It will take two users less than 3 seconds to generate a  common
private key of 256 bits useng an AT 286 pc operating at 16 MHg.

     AFINA uses  the  disk  operating system MS DOS 3.30 + and needs
32K of RAM memory. Any CGA, EGA or VGA graphic adapter can be used. A
hard disk is desirable to speed up processing.

     Delivery: AFINA  software  on  5.25  DS/DD  or  installation by
LAN-Ctypto. LAN-Cryoto provides guides and after-sales (warranty  and
post-warranty) service  of  the installed products as well as uodated
versions and supplies them on favourable terms.


                                 V E S T A
                           File encryption system

     VESTA is a package of programs providing the encryption of files
on a user's disk.

     VESTA employs  the  most  secure  methods  of cryptographic data
protection such as the Data Encryption Standart (DES),  a universally
recognized system  endrosed  by  Western  goverments  and  commercial
institutions, GOST 28147-89,  national data encryption  standards  in
computer networks  as  well  as  two  LAN-Crypto  algorithms for data
encryption providing processing speed of 200 Kbyte/sec. on AT-286 (12
Mhz) PC. This is a record time for encryption programs.

     VESTA will allow you to assure your PC's data integrity, provide
raw a "transparent"  mode  of  exchange  with  a  hard  disk  without
delaying data   processing.   By   choosing   the  appropriate  VESTA
encryption algorithm,  you will be able to have  secure  exchange  of
information with  most  encryption programm users in this country and
abroad. Encryption key input can be carried out  both  from  magnetic
mediums or keyboard.

     The number of keys of VESTA for cryptographic algorithms:
                            18
     - DES                10
                            77
     - GOST 28147-89      10
                            77
     - VESTA 1            10
                            77
     - VESTA 2            10

     The low boundary of the encryption security is determined by the
DES algoritm.
     For users   of   IBM   PC  ,  and  compatibles,  VESTA  provides
man-machine communicatin through the Disk  Operating  System  MS  DOS
3.30+.

     Program size of VESTA package:
     DES              - 6 Kb
     GOST 28146-89    - 2 Kb
     VESTA 1          - 2 Kb
     VESTA 2          - 2 Kb

     VESTA provides friendly interface and detailed help.

     DELIVERY: VESTA  software  on  5.25  DS/DD  or  installation  by
LAN-Crypto, guides.

     LAN-Crypto provides  after-sales  (warranty  and  post-warranty)
service of the installed products and information on updated versions
of programms and  makes  them  available  on  favourable  terms.  The
extrended reference services.


                              NOTARY
               SECURE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE SYSTEM

        NOTARY is a system for generating electronic signature for PC
files  assuring  their  integrity and providing the ability to verify
the  identy  of  the  author  of the data auhor. You can use Notarius
while storing information  distributing floppy disks, or transmitting
information throw public  communication chanel. "Digital (electronic)
signature" is a full analogue of a handwritten signature.

        The NOTARY " digital  signature " employs two algorithms: one
which produces the  signature  is kept secret, while the other, which
verifies the identity of the author, is disseminated to recipients of
of the signed documents.

        The NOTARY "digital signature" procedure employs the  program
"SIGNATUR"  to  "sign"  a document file and creates a signature  file
which impossible to forge.

        The  NOTARY  checking  programm  analysizes  the  contents of
document  file  and quickly and securely checks that the signature is
authentic.

        NOTARY  allows  you  to  quickly  and  effectively  introduce
paperless  processing  into offices, local networks, banking systems,
exchanges system, data communication networks, etc.

        NOTARY employs more advanced method of "electronic signature"
than widely recognized RSA Digital Signature, which has been endorsed
by commercial and goverment institotions in the United States.

        NOTARY's original algorithms and programm solutions allow the
user  to  speed  up  the  operation  of  signing  documents four-fold
compared with best known standarts.

        NOTARY  employs the Disk Operating System MS DOS 3.30+ on IBM
PC, and compatibles with the graphic adapter EGA (VGA).

        NOTARY  needs 15 KB of RAM and offers a friendly interface and
detalied help.

        Delivery:  NOTARY  software  comes  on  5.25  DS/DD  or can be
installed by "LAN Crypto", stuff we also provide documentation.

        "LAN Crytpo"  provides  warranty  and post-warranty service of
the  installation  products  and  information  on  updated versions of
programs  when  avaiilable  offers them on favourable terms to current
users.


Best regards.
