You recently contacted ViaCrypt and asked for information about
ViaCrypt PGP, and that it be sent to you electronically.
    
ViaCrypt PGP Version 2.4 for MS-DOS is now available for shipment. 
Appearing below is information from our literature, along with
details about ordering ViaCrypt PGP.


        ViaCrypt Introduces...          ViaCrypt(tm) PGP(tm)
                                        Pretty Good Privacy(tm)

        Protect The Privacy Of Your Files And E-Mail Messages
        =====================================================

Your files and messages.  They're personal.  They're private.  And
no one's business but yours.  You may be planning a political
campaign, preparing your taxes, or negotiating a contract. 
Whatever it is, you don't want your private electronic mail
(e-mail) or confidential documents read by anyone without your
permission.

ViaCrypt PGP is the perfect tool for individuals, small businesses,
large corporations, or anyone who values the privacy of their
proprietary or sensitive information. 

A software program that combines powerful cryptography with
ease-of-use, ViaCrypt PGP provides the ability to encrypt files and
messages.  Using Digital Signatures, it also provides a facility
for message authentication.


               You Control The Keys To Your Privacy
               ------------------------------------

With ViaCrypt PGP, you are in complete control of your privacy. YOU
create your keys.  YOU decide how long they are valid. YOU decide
who to trust. 

Other systems require you to place your trust in a disinterested
third party, or worse yet, a chain of faceless people you've never
met.  ViaCrypt PGP allows you to do so too, but never requires it. 
YOU are always in control.

ViaCrypt PGP is for people who don't want to surrender control of
their privacy.


                         Strong Cryptography
                         -------------------

ViaCrypt PGP combines the respected RSA system for Public Key
Cryptography with state-of-the-art IDEA(TM) encryption to protect
your files and electronic mail, and to let you communicate securely
with people you have never met.                              Features
                              --------

    * Protects the privacy of your files and e-mail messages.

    * Digitally signs files and e-mail messages to protect them
      from tampering and to authenticate the sender.

    * Sophisticated key management

    * RSA/IDEA hybrid encryption scheme

    * Message digests for digital signatures

    * Data compression before encryption

    * Simple, command-line interface for ease of use

    * Easy-to-understand documentation


                            How It Works
                            ------------

ViaCrypt PGP combines the best features of conventional and public
key cryptography.  Using conventional secret key cryptography, a
file can be encrypted using a key, then sent to the recipient. The
recipient decrypts the file using the same key. Conventional
cryptography is very fast, but it is difficult to provide the
recipient with the key in a secure manner.

Public key cryptography eliminates the problems associated with
distributing keys. Using public key cryptography, the key is split
into two halves: A private key that you never reveal, and a public
key that you can freely distribute. The public key and private key
are mathematically related such that anything encrypted using the
public key can be decrypted only using the matching private key.

In a process invisible to the user, ViaCrypt PGP creates a
temporary one-time key, called a session key, to encrypt the file
using fast conventional cryptography. Then the recipient's public
key is used to encrypt the session key. The encrypted session key
is sent along with the encrypted file to the recipient.  Once the
file is encrypted, only the intended recipient(s) can read it.

Using a single ViaCrypt PGP command, the recipient uses her own
private key to recover the session key, then uses that key to
quickly decrypt the file.

Message authentication is also provided. The sender's own private
key can be used to encrypt a 'fingerprint' or message digest of the
file or message. This creates a digital signature of the file or
message, which the recipient can check by using the sender's public
key to decrypt and compare with the original. The digital signatureproves that the sender was the true originator, and the file or
message has not been altered by anyone else.


                      ViaCrypt PGP Enables You To:
                      ----------------------------

    * Encrypt files or messages, sign them, or both

    * Decrypt previously encrypted files or messages

    * Check previously generated digital signatures

    * Encrypt messages to multiple recipients

    * Encrypt files or messages using just conventional
      cryptography

    * Generate your own keys

    * Easily add and remove other people's public keys to your 'key
      ring'

    * View the keys on your key ring

    * Revoke your keys

    * Re-format encrypted files so they can be sent through e-mail
      channels

    * Sign and certify other people's public keys

    * Specify 'trust parameters' for various keys
