I had to reformat the TAL press releases to make them readable, so I
thought I'd save others the trouble...


TETHERLESS ACCESS LTD. ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC ALLIANCES FOR WIRELESS MAN
DEPLOYMENT

October 4, 1993, Fremont, California

Tetherless Access, Ltd. (TAL), a leader in the development of
user-provided wireless metropolitan area networks (MAN), today announced
the formation of three separate strategic business and technology
alliances.  The alliances envision the provision of wireless access,
applications development, packet radio hardware development and new
services for wireless connectivity to the worldwide Internet.

TAL has developed a "plug-and-play" interface for the Macintosh platform
for the unlicensed operation of packet radio systems.  The systems
enable peer-to-peer wireless connectivity over AppleTalk networks within
a MAN environment.  The system software also provides transparent
connectivity to TCP/IP networks and to services available on the
worldwide Internet.

User-provided wireless networking allows anyone within range of another
system to automatically make a network connection.  This "ad hoc"
network means that each node not only generates its own traffic, but
also relays the transmissions of nearby nodes.  Each system owner
becomes a "de facto" member of the network.  The system provides a
low-cost connectivity solution for community networks, libraries,
schools, businesses, telecommuters, and an easily deployed
communications infrastructure for developing countries.  "In association
with our strategic alliances we will deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide
basis with a focus on providing access to the Internet" said Dewayne
Hendricks, President of TAL.

Pandora Systems of San Francisco, CA, a software development and network
operations company, will design Internet-based wireless networking
products and services.  Pandora's principals have been involved in the
establishment of PeaceNet, GreenNet, The WELL and have developed
numerous Internet applications including Veronica, one of the most
popular and useful navigation tools available on the Internet today.
"The Internet and wireless communications are both experiencing dramatic
growth.  The combination of these environments offer unparalleled
applications development opportunities" said Mark Graham, President of
Pandora Systems.

InterNex Information Services, Inc. of Menlo Park, CA, a provider of
high bandwidth connectivity to the Internet, will provide wireline
access points to the Internet for wireless MANs in major metropolitan
areas throughout the U.S.  InterNex and TAL will jointly market network
services to businesses, educational institutions, communities and
individuals.

Cylink of Sunnyvale, CA, the leading worldwide supplier of commercial
communications security products and spread spectrum wireless modems and
systems, is cooperating in the supplying of spread spectrum radios for
deployment in TAL's MAN packet radio systems on a worldwide basis.
Cylink's founders are leading authorities in encryption and spread
spectrum technologies, and the company currently services customers in
over 40 countries.

Tetherless Access, Ltd., based in Fremont, California, is a leader in
the development and deployment of "plug-and-play" wireless metropolitan
area networks.  The company's products allow customers to achieve
efficient, low-cost, flexible, high-quality wireless data communications
in metropolitan network environments and to the worldwide Internet.



TETHERLESS ACCESS, LTD. ANNOUNCES NET/MAC PRO WITH SUPPORT FOR POWERTALK

October 4, 1993, Fremont, California

Tetherless Access, Ltd. (TAL), a leader in the development of
user-provided wireless metropolitan area networks (MAN), today announced
NET/Mac Pro, a new version of its NET/Mac Internet Protocol application
for packet radio environments.  NET/Mac Pro adds support for a personal
gateway that allows PowerTalk81 users to exchange mail with SMTP servers
over a TCP/IP network.  PowerTalk is Apple's new mail and messaging
technology, built in to System 781 Pro.

This combination provides convenient Internet access for Apple Macintosh
users through wireless Metropolitan Area Networks.  TAL's standard
products have led the way for wireless TCP/IP network access on the
Macintosh.  Now, with System 7 Pro, this access is simplified even more
by not having to use a separate SMTP client program to transfer mail.
"The PowerTalk universal mailbox and drag send capability integrated
with our NET/Mac Pro product allows our users to deploy wireless MANs on
a worldwide basis with a focus on providing easy access to the Internet
mail services" said Dewayne Hendricks, President of TAL.

TAL has formed strategic alliances with InterNex Information
Services, Inc.  of Menlo Park, CA, Cylink of Sunnyvale, CA and Pandora
Systems of San Francisco, CA.  Together the four companies will provide
hardware, software and services which can be used to provide low-cost
MAN connectivity solutions for community networks, libraries, schools,
businesses, telecommuters, and an easily deployed communications
infrastructure for developing countries.  "In association with our
strategic alliances we will deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide basis
with a focus on providing access to the Internet" said Dewayne
Hendricks, President of TAL.

Tetherless Access, Ltd., based in Fremont, California, is a leader in
the development and deployment of "plug-and-play" wireless metropolitan
area networks.  The company's products allow customers to achieve
efficient, low-cost, flexible, high-quality wireless data communications
in metropolitan network environments and to the worldwide Internet.
