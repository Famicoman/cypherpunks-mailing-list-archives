More news from FUTURE-C in Re:gards to The Bank of the Internet.  I say
again that I know not much about this biz or crit... I only post it here
for your info:  

Forwarded message:

*&gt; Date:    Tue, 12 Oct 1993 22:13:35 -0700
*&gt; From:    John Frost &lt;frost@NETCOM.COM&gt;
*&gt; Subject: Re: The Bank of the Internet!?
*&gt; 
*&gt; The Capitalization of the Internet. And I thought it was gonna come from the
*&gt; outside. All this talk of AT&amp;T or TCI buying parts of the net and eventually
*&gt; kicking those who won't pay exorbinate prices (that is the nightmare, right&gt;)
*&gt; off the Internet (or the DataHighway, as it will then be called) is just dust
*&gt; in the wind compared to what this Eric guy is planning.
*&gt; 
*&gt; Actually, his idea isn't that bad. It would certainly help those shareware
*&gt; developers to earn some dough and us Authors could get a few pennies for our
*&gt; words. It won't be too long before somebody thinks they have information that
*&gt; people would be willing to pay for. They'll set up an email list and you'll
*&gt; have to pay to be on it. Clarinews will make more money. The Electronic Zines
*&gt; can recover some costs, and even the OTIS gallery could collect some dues.
*&gt; Soon it will become obvious who has the capital to control the net's
*&gt; information (my bet is on Bill Gates), and a new hierarchy based on the old
*&gt; hierarchy of capitalism will soon run the Internet. (this is of course a bleak
*&gt; vision, but I haven't been given reason to think otherwise.)
*&gt; 
*&gt; Chandler wrote this:
*&gt; + But the real boggler is that this fellow Eric is, with the backing of
*&gt; + the Electronic Frontier Foundation, going to start a Credit Union based on
*&gt; + up-to-date encryption schemes and using the Internet as the monetary
*&gt; + highway! It involves using something called digital money -- a system of
*&gt; + encrypted data that expires over time, but that a highly flexible ability
*&gt; + to purchase quantities or services. The data itself will be located
*&gt; + over several nodes, so that no one site has all the info about your
*&gt; + account, but that any "quorum number" of bank nodes can reconstruct the
*&gt; + whole picture of your assets. Anyone trying to crack the system would
*&gt; + have to crack, not just one or two nodes, but a quorum number. Such nodes
*&gt; + will be distributed internationally, though favoring nations with
*&gt; + encryption-favorable legislation.
*&gt; 
*&gt; Sounds Technically sound, but as a political entity? I don't think it will
*&gt; hold water. Doesn't it have to pass the Federal Banking System board or
*&gt; something. THat should take nearly 5 years. Buy then don't you suspect the net
*&gt; will have morphed beyond the culture that would make this system needed?
*&gt; 
*&gt; This feels like just another introduction of what was bad in the ER (everyday
*&gt; reality) that we might surpass in VR.
*&gt; 
*&gt; + I'm oversimplifying all this. But the whole notion of a Bank of the
*&gt; + Internet, backed by the EFF and running encrypted international monetary
*&gt; + transactions seems... well, this is Future Culture: what do you think?
*&gt; 
*&gt; It Stinks. Where do I sign up.
