This will truly be my final remark, as this subject is hardly pertinent to the
forum but has nontheless provoked some interesting discussion.

I am repeatedly told that I am a right-wing religious paranoid, have fascist
fantasies about government, and that overall I am a moron.  While I have
difficulty refuting the third claim :), it is unfair to make accusations 1
and 2 about me without any knowledge about who I am and where I stand on
societal issues.

What has never been mentioned is the fact that none of this subliminal
stuff has seriously been studied.  People (perry, woodhead, et al.) talk
about how unscientific, absurd, etc. this topic is, all the while ignoring
their (and my) ignorance about the subject and using studies as scientific
proof, which is a contradiction unto itself, as well as unnamed first-hand
sources "inside" the industry while not identifying their position.  Whereas
they would rather let it be buried for ideological reasons, I would prefer the
subject to be explored in the open scientific community, opening it the
pressure of scientific scrutiny.  My reasons as follows: I have read books
and seen, first-hand, experiments on the nature of behavior control.  Until
you have seen people turned into automata you cannot appreciate what the
experience gives to you as a human being: perspective.  I would not want to
be controlled by _any_ power, be it government, sibling, or economy.  If
there is a chance that there are means by which I can be controlled
_without my knowledge_, I want to be aware of the methodry of such attacks.

Is that paranoid?  Quite possibly.  Cautious and intelligent?  Perhaps. 
Perhaps there are those on this forum who would prefer to let sleeping
dogs lie and let corporations run free over people instead of the
government?  

But I cannot speak for people, and I would prefer it next time I respond to a
message that the response is not a list of those "words put into my
mouth," as this discussion turned out to be.

You may call me names, you may ignore me, but the fact is the subject
remains as it is.  The matter has not been closed.
