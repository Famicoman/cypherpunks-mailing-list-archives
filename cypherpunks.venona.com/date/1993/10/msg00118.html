&gt;
&gt;Punksters,
&gt;
&gt;I've just about had it with posts like Matthew Gream's:
&gt;
&gt;    . . . attempting to play 'smart-ass' to your
&gt;    investigators is only going to result in more problems
&gt;    for you. Its a non-ideal world, and they definitely have
&gt;    the ability to cause you substantial problems.
&gt;
&gt;    . . . I feel it is essential to show them everything
&gt;    that they think is there, and convince them (as they
&gt;    will not be as competent in cryptographic analysis as
&gt;    yourself [at least you hope]) that there is nothing
&gt;    hidden.
&gt;
&gt;Didn't any of you appeasers and apologists read and *understand*
&gt;HACKER CRACKDOWN?  Once you are the focus of an investigation,
&gt;they are already causing you substantial problems.  Cooperation
&gt;only gives your tormentors more ammunition.  You are not going
&gt;to convince them of anything.  You cannot talk your way out of
&gt;anything.  What you can--and will--do is dig yourself in deeper.
&gt;After that, you will probably try to get off the hook by rolling
&gt;over--like a bitch in heat--on your friends and associates.
&gt;
&gt;The ONLY thing that works is (a) stonewall, stonewall, stonewall
&gt;until you get competent legal representation, then (b) do what
&gt;your lawyer's says.  Period.
&gt;
&gt;Consider this your wimp wakeup call.
&gt;
&gt; S a n d y

A wise mindvox user said recently on the round-table forum:
"If you have nothing to hide and did nothing wrong then you have absolutely
 nothing to lose by keeping quiet"

Having seen many a hacker (and non-hacker) get into trouble over the years,
I'd have to say that Sandy's assesment is correct in the majority of cases.

as for "rolling over--like a bitch in heat-- on your friends and associates"
this too I have seen all too often and many times to little benefit to the
rat who is talking. Dragging other people down with you serves little 
purpose IMHO and is a particularly dispicable and all too common trend among
hackers of recent years.

oh and sandy, I did read the Hacker Crackdown :-)



Let me quote a second recent post:

&gt;Date: Sun, 03 Oct 1993 15:51:55 -0400 (EDT)
&gt;From: Mike Ingle &lt;MIKEINGLE@delphi.com&gt;
&gt;Subject: Excessive Crap &amp; Flamage
&gt;To: cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt;
&gt;This list is becoming completely unreadable! First the POISON PILL and now
&gt;PGP IN FIDO just seem to go on and on. And how many before that?
&gt;(Troglodyte mind-rapists, etc) I've got about a meg of utter crap in my
&gt;email file, most of it unread or skimmed. If people want to fight, why not
&gt;do it in private mail, back up your positions, and then post your
&gt;conclusions if you manage to come up with any. Please don't CC all your
&gt;flames to the list. And please don't echo a three-page post to add one
&gt;line of comments to it.
&gt;
&gt;What happened to all the idealism? Total privacy, cryptophones, digital
&gt;cash, zero-knowledge cooperation, bringing down governments and setting the
&gt;world free? That's what the list is for, not mindless flaming.
&gt;
&gt;Aargggh! MikeIngle@delphi.com
&gt;

although no one is asking me, I'll admit that perhaps this message itself
is guilty of the above. And I am on the verge of unsubscribing after a
couple of months being on the list because the daily time requirement to
keep on top of the messages is exceeding an hour. Perhaps splintering the
list into the following 2 main areas is an option: 

1) A fairly lean-bandwidth list containing technical facts, news articles,
bibliographic info, short source code, etc.

2) A more fluffy-content list containing general comments, opinions, flames,
etc.

Subscription to list 2 would probably necessitate subscription to list 1.
But for those who want the meat without the potatoes, subscription to list 1
is all that would be required.

I recall this coming up about a month and a half ago, more calls for
keeping the messages "pertinent" to the cypherpunk agenda. The problem has
only grown worse.
