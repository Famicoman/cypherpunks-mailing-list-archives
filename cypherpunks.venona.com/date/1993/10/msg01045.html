Forwarded message:

&gt; Could you forward this to cypherpunks for me?  Walter is a technoid and
&gt; happened to be one of the plaintiffs in Steve Jackson Games (e-mail user on
&gt; Illuminati).  I'm hoping one of the 'punks might be able to comment to him
&gt; on his theory -- it sounds interesting to me, but I'm not technical enough
&gt; to know if its got any merit.  Thanks.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi Shari -- it's been a while....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I know you're probably not the right person to talk to about Clipper
&gt; &gt;chip stuff, but I figured you could forward this and tell me who is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Basically, I think I see NSA's backdoor in the whole scheme.  Probably
&gt; &gt;other people have noticed this too, but in case they haven't (and I
&gt; &gt;haven't seen any comment on these lines on comp.org.eff.talk), I figured
&gt; &gt;I'd point it out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The trick isn't necessarily in the algorithm (which I don't know, of
&gt; &gt;course).  I think it's in the key generation process.  I read Dorothy
&gt; &gt;Denning's description as posted to comp.org.eff.talk the other day, and
&gt; &gt;decided it sounded fishy.  Why are the secret per-chip keys generated
&gt; &gt;from the chip serial number (which is observable by anyone with the
&gt; &gt;law-enforcement key)?  To escrow keys, all you need is to 1) associate a chip
&gt; &gt;serial number with a secret key and 2) split the secret key into two,
&gt; &gt;unusuable parts for the escrow agents.  I can't see any reason why the
&gt; &gt;secret key isn't just a random number (or rather the XOR of two random
&gt; &gt;numbers, one for each escrow agent).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Instead, we've got this complex algorithm for converting the chip serial
&gt; &gt;number into the chip secret key.  Thus, if you know the chip serial
&gt; &gt;number, the key generating algorithm, and the initialization states for
&gt; &gt;the key generator (provided by the two escrow agents) *you can compute
&gt; &gt;the chip secret key*!  (Or so it appears on a very superficial reading.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I suspect you could dispense with knowing the initialization states, if
&gt; &gt;you were NSA and could obtain any chip from the same batch -- you open
&gt; &gt;the chip up (I'm sure *they* know how to do that), extract its secret
&gt; &gt;key, and reverse-engineer the initialization data.  (This last step is
&gt; &gt;non-trivial, but I'd be surprised if NSA couldn't do it -- it's a
&gt; &gt;variant of known-plaintext attack.)  It's also possible that NSA may
&gt; &gt;*supply* the initialization states, or an algorithm for generating them,
&gt; &gt;or at least advice on how to pick them.  After all, it's their game,
&gt; &gt;they get to make the rules....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In any case, I can see no way that using the *observable* chip serial
&gt; &gt;number to help generate the chip secret key can in *any* way improve the
&gt; &gt;security of the system.  You'd be much better off just sticking any old
&gt; &gt;random number into the chip as a secret key, and just noting it down
&gt; &gt;with the associated chip serial number in the escrow files.  Personally,
&gt; &gt;I think I'd use a non-algorithmic mechanism for generating random keys
&gt; &gt;-- perhaps a truly random number source, such as atomic decay processes.
&gt; &gt;There's only one of these things -- it can afford to get fancy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Disclaimer: I'm not a cryptography expert, so it's possible I'm missing
&gt; &gt;something here.  Possibly factoring in the chip serial number makes it
&gt; &gt;harder to crack secret keys if you somehow manage to obtain a few chips
&gt; &gt;from the same batch and open them.  But it certainly seems suspicious to
&gt; &gt;me....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;---Walter
