&gt;&gt; We could lay our own wires/fibers.

&gt;Well, we'd like crypto for the masses and I don't think that the masses are
&gt;yet ready to put out the bucks for spread spectrum boards and infrared laser
&gt;communications gear...  It'd be really nice to have such a decentralized
&gt;network, though.

Sure, the masses wouldn't do it, but how many are needed?
How many users are thereb on the net, compared to how many sites?
All it would take is a dozen or so people in each city, and itt could 
be done. Don't know about intercity stuff, though.

A friend of mine is putting together some ideas regarding what he calls
'punknet', using a bundle of small, solar-powered relays, maybe microwave
links, or infra-red, or short-distance packet radio, whcih could
be manufactured in bulk and stuck all over a city, disguised as bits of
construction, ettc, so tthey would be hard to see, acting as switching devices
so that we could have a completely open and untraceable network within a city.

&gt;&gt; We could set up a mesh network of infrared lasers through the air.  Last
&gt;&gt; time I looked, there were no laws against shining lights out your window as
&gt;&gt; long as they didn't bother anyone.  An infrared laser could hardly bother
&gt;&gt; anyone.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;...
&gt;&gt; very low range radio, ....  Each card would connect to three or more
&gt;&gt; neighbors and become part of the global mesh.  Adaptive routing with no
&gt;&gt; global map would suffice for the card and would keep the whole system
&gt;&gt; peer-to-peer with no need for central control and no chance for central
&gt;&gt; tapping.

Serves me right for not reading through the message first. Yes, this is what
my friend was thinking of.

&gt;This would be the perfect network in which to deploy DC nets....  (dining
&gt;cryptographers).

dining?
