The following came from another mailing list.
An interesting Cypherpunks opportunity is that it appears to provide
a general broadcasting capability, depending on what authentication methods
(if any) it's using.  Aside from the fun of automatic-upgrade software,
it's a great opportunity for a media hack.  Maybe it won't be widely
supported by April 1, 1996, but it certainly should be by April 1, 1997.
(Hmmm - isn't X-Day in 1997?)  I assume it either runs UDP or runs
http to poll.

&gt;     There is a new web site <A  HREF="http://www.pointcast.com">http://www.pointcast.com</A> which provides a
&gt;     program file pcninstl.exe. You download pcninstl.exe and run the
&gt;     program on your PC from Windows 95 or Windows 3.1
&gt;
&gt;     PCN is a program that interfaces to the Internet using port 80 and
&gt;     provides you customizable up-to-the minute downloads of news
&gt;     headlines, stocks, customizable sports, customizable weather,
&gt;     customizable financial, Internet access (HTTP only with this release)
&gt;     and personal (horoscopes and lotteries).  You can click on the dynamic
&gt;     advertisements and go directly to their web page.  PCN even turns into
&gt;     a dynamic screen saver with your specific preference.  Periodically,
&gt;     you are informed that there is an upgraded version, would you like to
&gt;     down load; automatic upgrades.  PointCast Network is currently in
&gt;     Beta 0.9, is FREE and they say it will continue to be free, support by
&gt;     advertising commercials.  Does this sound too good to be true???
&gt;
&gt;     Well, Maybe it is too good to be true.  This program becomes a proxy
&gt;     operator for you. Downloading, through your firewall, whatever it
&gt;     decides should be downloaded, data, new executables, etc.  What is to
&gt;     prevent a hacker (or cracker if you like that term better) from
&gt;     offering a similar product which captures you PC keystrokes and scans
&gt;     your hard drive and uploads information, accesses your LAN or PC
&gt;     functions, or destroys PC files and data.
&gt;
&gt;     Even worse what if a hacker breaks into the PointCast Web site after
&gt;     it has successfully distributed its product to millions of Internet
&gt;     users?  Are you sure you trust PointCast enough to perform that next
&gt;     automatic upgrade?
&gt;
&gt;     What about other proxy type programs, such as CompuServe's WinCim? It
&gt;     appears that any type of user proxy program opens the door that most
&gt;     of us have closed using firewalls.
&gt;
&gt;     What are you thoughts and comments? Do you have any concerns with
&gt;     products like this? How do you or your company handle these products?
&gt;
