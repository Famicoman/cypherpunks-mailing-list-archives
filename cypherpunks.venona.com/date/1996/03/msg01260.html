In recent months, a self-appointed group of list members have taken upon
themselves to argue that _anything_ that does not have to do with certain
topics they find appropriate is "not related to crypto, so take it
elsewhere." Regrettably, most reasonable people have grown quiet about
anything that smacks of politics or ideology, leaving the field clear for
certain ranting lunatics.

While I agree that the Cypherpunks list is not a libertarian or socialist
theory discussion area, the fact is that crypto is tied intimately to
incredibly important policy and jurisprudential areas. The early meetings
were not held, and the list was not formed, solely to debate the merits of
3DES vs. IDEA or other crypto arcania, for which sci.crypt and
sci.crypt.research already existed.

The link between the FDA and crypto is not as much of a reach as some might
think. When a government passes what are the equivalent of "dietary laws"
(what one may eat, drink, etc.), even if based on supposed studies, this is
a major limit on personal freedom.

Would members of this list support an FDA-like organization passing
judgement on which algorithms are considered "safe and effective" (and by
whose standards?)?

I mentioned my friend's detour to Mexico to obtain medicine for his son in
passing, not to distract the list. I feel, however, that anyone who argues
that a group of bureacrats and lawyers in Washington, D.C. have the "right"
to send someone to jail for eating something they have decided is evil
should reconsider their committment to this position.

I have no problem with people deciding that certain foods or herbs or
medicines are not to their liking, or are "snake oil," but I have a real
problem with them raiding the houses of those who think differently and
seizing their property, sending them to prison, etc.

Think of the parallels to crypto. Believe me, I don't even want the bozos
at IPG to be enjoined from selling their snake oil. Suckers are born every
minute, as IPG knows, and I have to think of it as evolution in action.
