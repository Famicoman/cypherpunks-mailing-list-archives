    CONCORD, Calif., Feb. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Premenos Technology Corp.
(Nasdaq: PRMO), a leading provider of electronic data interchange (EDI)
software solutions for electronic commerce applications, today announced
the election of Admiral William O. Studeman, U.S. Navy-retired, to its
Board of Directors effective immediately. Studeman will also act as
consultant on special projects including security and encryption issues.
          Admiral Studeman, age 56, is the former Deputy Director of Central
Intelligence and served for five months in 1995 as the acting Director
of Central Intelligence. He retired from the Navy in October 1995. Prior
to his assignment at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Studeman was
the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), and before that was
the Director of Naval Intelligence. In these positions, Studeman was
involved in attempting to develop public policies and technologies that
addressed the complex and often conflicting issues of enhanced economic
competitiveness, law enforcement's warranted requirement for information
transparency in pursuit of criminal investigations, national security
interest in combating potential information warfare threats, and the
country's overall increased need for enhanced protection of its
information-related systems and applications.
          In commenting on his election to the Board of Premenos, Studeman
stated that "Premenos is not only a leader in facilitating the promising
future of electronic commerce, it is the first company in the
marketplace with a product line for enhanced protection, security and
integrity for the Internet and other electronic communications-related
business transactions." Studeman added, "In working with Lew Jenkins and
others in the company, I have an opportunity to better frame the
government-industry dialogue and define the infrastructure, standards,
regulatory, technical and other directional factors which must be
addressed for electronic commerce -- a rapidly evolving industry segment
so fundamental to the future of the American lifestyle and national
security."
          Lew Jenkins, chairman and founder of Premenos said, "The
infrastructure for moving critical business data over the Internet is
crucial to the success of electronic commerce. We welcome Admiral
Studeman to our team and look forward to his help in developing a
trusted model for the electronic commerce market and establishing a
solid infrastructure similar to the stringent military requirements that
have been in place for decades."
