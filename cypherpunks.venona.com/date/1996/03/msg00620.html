&gt;&gt; 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice
&gt;&gt;   Whoever willfully endeavors by means of encryption to obstruct,

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think we may reasonably assume that this section was very carefully 
&gt;&gt; written, and thus it may contain meanings (or avoid containing meanings) 
&gt;&gt; that only a careful reading will disclose.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Contrary to some other sloppy  interpretations that I've seen here recently 
&gt;&gt; from organizations that ought to know better, I see nothing in this section 
&gt;&gt; that limits the prosecution on this law to people who are actually 
&gt;&gt; participating in a crime.  This distinction is vital.   While the sentence 
&gt;&gt; is not diagrammed, it appears to be the INFORMATION which is in "furtherance 
&gt;&gt; to a felony," not the "obstructing" of that communication.  The implication 
&gt;&gt; is that it is not necessary that a person know the exact information 
&gt;&gt; involved or be able to decrypt it; he needs only be deliberately using 
&gt;&gt; encryption to prevent the knowledge of what the information is about, or its 
&gt;&gt; routing.  (As in an encrypted anonymous remailer, for instance.) 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;???  Your third sentence doesn't make any sense.

Well, I'll separate it for closer review:

&gt;&gt; While the sentence 
&gt;&gt; is not diagrammed, it appears to be the INFORMATION which is in "furtherance 
&gt;&gt; to a felony," not the "obstructing" of that communication.

The problem is that the original sentence (in the proposed law) is 
ambiguous.  But I think the most likely interpretation is that it is the 
"information" which is in "furtherance of a felony," and "obstructing the 
commmication" of that information is the crime they define.


&gt;  While I agree with your 
&gt;position, why would it *possibly* be a crime to interefere with felonious 
&gt;communcations?

The law is POORLY worded.  Padgett Peterson noticed this yesterday, BTW, and 
commented on it on Cypherpunks.  You've stumbled on the alternate meaning 
that he complained about.  Realistically, however, I think we can probably 
agree that this meaning was not the one they intended; that's why for 
purposes of analysis I study the other meaning.

&gt;  The lanuguage is lamentably unambiguous about the
&gt;fact that it is the obstruction and not the information that is
&gt;in furtherance of a felony... 

I think I disagree.  What we need, however, is an "emergency-call English 
major" who could diagram the various possibilities for us and we could 
study them separately.  There's plenty of ambiguity in this sentence; but I 
think that is absolutely intentional.  


&gt;&gt; Aside from this, it isn't clear what is meant by the phrase, "obstruct, 
&gt;&gt; impede, or prevent the communication of information in furtherance to a 
&gt;&gt; felony."    An obvious problem is this:  How will they know if the use of 
&gt;&gt; encryption actually had that effect?  If it was UNsuccessful, then 
obviously 
&gt;&gt; that encryption did not prevent the government from obtaining information.  
&gt;&gt; If it was SUCCESSFUL, then how is the 
government to know that the 
&gt;&gt; communication in question was "in furtherance to a felony"?  Even if they 
&gt;&gt; can prove the felony by other means, how can they show that the 
&gt;&gt; communication actually had anything to do with the crime?
&gt;
&gt;It is quite conceivable that an unsuccessful attempt to obstruct
&gt;justice might cause additional trouble, time, and expense to the
&gt;guys in the white hats. 

That depends on who you believe actually wears the white hats...

&gt; Note that the language does not distinguish
&gt;between successful and unsuccessful attempts...though you're right
&gt;that it seems that only unsuccessful attempts could be verified...
&gt;the rest is clouded by your assumption that the information, rather
&gt;than the obstruction, must be in furtherance of the crime...

Well, I invite you to try to construct an interpretation of the sentence in 
as many ways as you can imagine.  I think you'll discover that it is 
practically intended to mislead.


&gt;&gt; Another problem:  Encryption, per se, does not "prevent the communication 
of 
&gt;&gt; information."  What it does, of course, is to prevent the UNDERSTANDING of 
&gt;&gt; that information.  Do the writers of this bill intend to use this law to 
&gt;&gt; punish the LATTER effect, rather than the former? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Further, how is the person to be charged to know if his use of encryption 
&gt;&gt; had the effect of "obstruct[ing], imped[ing], or prevent[ing] the 
&gt;&gt; communication of that information?  If he encrypts a file to his hard disk, 
&gt;&gt; and he doesn't intentionally send the file to the cops, how is he supposed 
&gt;&gt; to anticipate that the use of encryption had this effect?  As far as HE 
&gt;&gt; knows, it was simply his decision to not send the file to the cops; he can't 
&gt;&gt; be expected to know that they'll show up the next morning with a search 
&gt;&gt; warrant and take his computer, can he?  Would his refusal to provide the 
&gt;&gt; decrypt key constitute a violation of this section?
&gt;
&gt;Probably.  That's what the word "willful" is doing in there.   Read
&gt;carefully:  it's willful obstruction, not willful encryption...

Justa sec... I think you've forgotten that merely running an anonymous 
encrypted remailer could be considered "willful obstruction."  Now, if the 
communication wasn't "in furtherance to a felony" then it wouldn't be 
criminal (it would be a LEGAL "willful obstruction, right?) , but then again 
the operator wouldn't know that, would he?  

Which brings us to yet another ambiguity:  The operator of an anonymous 
encrypted remailer wouldn't know that any given packet was "in furtherance 
of a felony" but he MIGHT be absolutely aware that any one of them COULD be! 
 Does this rise to the level of violating the law?  If not, why not?


&gt;I am not a lawyer, although I play one on the net.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with your position, but you're not reading as closely 
&gt;as the enemy will...            


Who, in this case, is "the enemy"?  As far as I can see, "the enemy" are the 
people who wrote this section of the bill.

While it's been a few decades since I last diagrammed a sentence, I will 
start by putting parentheses around sections of this sentence to separate it 
into what I believe is its "intended" meaning.  


&gt;&gt; 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice
&gt;&gt;   Whoever willfully endeavors (by means of encryption) to (obstruct,
&gt;&gt;    impede, or prevent) the communication of (information in furtherance
&gt;&gt;    to a felony) (which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States),
&gt;&gt;    to an investigative or law enforcement officer shall...


I challenge anyone to re-write this section to:

1.  Achieve what he believes to be a "reasonable" result and

2.  Avoids the criticisms that I've previously mentioned WRT this portion of
the 
bill.


Also, I think anyone who supports this kind of section should be able to 
give me a few examples of crimes whose investigation has (or could be) 
thwarted in a way that would violate this section.  I've said it before and 
I'll say it again:  The average citizen is essentially never the victim of a 
crime of this type.  For whom, then, is this law written?  I think it's 
written for the benefit of the politicians alone.  They want to live.
