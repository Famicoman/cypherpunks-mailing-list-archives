This is an interesting idea, though I think a really really insecure one.
What's keeping someone from posting ``trojan web pages'' and then waiting
for the pages to be soaked up by servers?  Something that says ``click
<here> to see the /etc/passwd file for this site!'' which runs some funky
CGI thing to cat /etc/passwd or, ``Enter your credit card number to buy
super wiz-bang gadget!'' or the like is a really scary, but very real,
possibility if great care is not taken in setting this kind of thing up.
News servers, on the other hand, don't suffer from this problem because
the data which they contain is much more passive in nature (at least, while
in the spool..) than HTML.

However, if someone would invest the time and effort in coming up with a
secure configuration, then it would be really really cool.
