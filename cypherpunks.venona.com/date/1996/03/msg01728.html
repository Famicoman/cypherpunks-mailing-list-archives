Maybe; &amp; who someone talks to &amp; how they do it is of no particular
interest to me.  However, he said something else: that foreign
language speakers were unavailable to most Americans.  This is easily
shown to be false.  That many other people in our English-speaking
community also believe it is interesting.  Often, they can provide
counterexamples themselves without too much trouble (&amp; you may recall
that Tim May did).  This says something about this culture.  What, I don't
know, but it's some kind of cognitive dissonance.

It occurs to me that members of certain large language groups
in the US, who don't speak English, sometimes make the same
statement -- "Everyone I want to talk to speaks X".

I don't know why this disclaimer is necessary, but please note that I
don't think for a moment that you all are "bad" if your beliefs are in
accord with what Tim May wrote.  Nor do I think you should
go out &amp; learn some random language.

&gt; One may quibble with the wisdom or morality of such a statement, but if
&gt; the second statement is true in your case, then there is no reason you
&gt; should have to learn another language. Most upper-income Americans have no

I'm not sure what the "second statement" is you're referring to.
Anyway, there are a lot of reasons one might choose to study
a foreign language, and many levels of fluency.  There are many
economic issues that could apply, &amp; some non - economic arguments
as well.  There are very good reasons not to bother, as well.
