Here is an example of what anonymous remailers can 
do.......

&gt; WAY WRONG NUMBER
&gt; 
&gt;   HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A CITY COUNCILMAN PORNED
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    JOSHUA QUITTNER
&gt; 
&gt;    This is a tale about how an online prank grows into an international
&gt;    incident. It also goes a long way toward explaining the fear many
&gt;    non-Internet people have about this out-of-control thing called
&gt;    cyberspace.
&gt; 
&gt;    Our story begins on the banks of Lake Erie, in Willowick, Ohio (pop.
&gt;    15,469). It is the last Monday night in January, about 9 o'clock. City
&gt;    councilman Frank Suponcic is home with his wife Linda when the phone
&gt;    rings. Linda answers. "Hi, this is Mike," says the man at the other
&gt;    end, politely enough. Linda chats with Mike, figuring he must be a
&gt;    constituent. (As Willowick's longest-serving ward councilman, Suponcic
&gt;    has lots of voters calling him at home.) After a while, Mike asks for
&gt;    Annette. Linda tells him he has the wrong number. Mike apologizes and
&gt;    hangs up.
&gt; 
&gt;    The phone rings again at 11:30 p.m. And again. And again. Wrong
&gt;    numbers until 4:30 a.m. A weary Suponcic wonders what's up and checks
&gt;    the Caller-ID logs on his phone. The first call was from British
&gt;    Columbia. The next was from Connecticut. There was one from
&gt;    Indianapolis and a few from California. Clearly these are not
&gt;    constituents. But who are they?
&gt; 
&gt;    Suponcic calls the Canadian back--it is now 5:30 a.m. in that time
&gt;    zone, and he is only too happy to wake the dude up--and he demands to
&gt;    know what is going on. The guy explains, vaguely, that he was merely
&gt;    answering an "ad on the Internet. You know, the one about horny
&gt;    housewives..."
&gt; 
&gt;    So now we have a problem. Suponcic, like a lot of people, has a new
&gt;    computer. But like most people, he hardly knows what the Internet is.
&gt;    Now, somewhere there's an ad on it. For horny housewives. With his
&gt;    home phone number.
&gt; 
&gt;    That night, when the next wrong number came in, Suponcic interrogated
&gt;    the caller and learned that the councilman's phone number was printed
&gt;    at the bottom of some pictures of naked women that had been posted to
&gt;    a Usenet newsgroup called alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, which,
&gt;    naturally, Suponcic had never heard of. But he had a friend in
&gt;    Cleveland who was something of a computer buff. So the next day the
&gt;    two of them jacked into Usenet and spent three hours sifting through
&gt;    about 7,400 files on alt. binaries.etc.
&gt; 
&gt;    Eventually, they found two with Suponcic's phone number. One featured
&gt;    a topless brunet wearing only a string of pearls and offering phone
&gt;    calls for "as low as 87 [cents] per minute." The other showed a blond
&gt;    woman advertising "hot amateur wives ready for you from there [sic]
&gt;    own bed." Yikes.
&gt; 
&gt;    Over the next week, Suponcic received more than 75 calls a day from
&gt;    lusty Netizens. "You just could not make phone calls," says the
&gt;    exasperated councilman. "And when you went to bed, you had to take
&gt;    your phone off the hook."
&gt; 
&gt;    It was the sorcerer's apprentice scenario, and there was no way to
&gt;    stop it.
&gt; 
&gt;    Suponcic, being a public official, knew his way around the local
&gt;    police department, and soon a detective started pounding the Net. By
&gt;    tracing the header information on the Usenet postings, the detective
&gt;    determined--O.K., this part is murky, we admit--that the messages had
&gt;    originated in Ohio, passed through Florida Online, an Internet
&gt;    provider in the Sunshine State, and then through anon.penet.fi, a free
&gt;    E-mail remailer service based in Finland that allows Internet users to
&gt;    post messages anonymously.
&gt; 
&gt;    The identity of the poster was, and is, unknown, though Suponcic has
&gt;    his suspicions. "It's my personal belief that the root of this is
&gt;    political," says the councilman, who had to get an unlisted telephone
&gt;    number and whose wife now wants to move.
&gt; 
&gt;    On Feb. 6, at Suponcic's urging, the Willowick city council passed a
&gt;    resolution asking the state and federal governments to close the
&gt;    "loopholes" that allowed anonymous remailers to operate outside the
&gt;    authority of U.S. law-enforcement officials. "Once you've achieved one
&gt;    of these anonymous identities, you're dangerous, and there's no way
&gt;    law enforcement can track it," Suponcic says. "The animal's out of
&gt;    control."
&gt; 
&gt;    Still not content, Suponcic contacted Steven LaTourette, the U.S.
&gt;    Congressman who represents his district. LaTourette's staff suspects
&gt;    that the problem lies with Julf Helsingius, the Finn who runs the
&gt;    anonymous remailer. They wrote a letter to the Finnish ambassador and
&gt;    sent copies to the Secretary of State and the chairman of the House
&gt;    Committee on International Relations. The State Department agreed last
&gt;    week to look into the complaint.
&gt; 
&gt;    But here's a reality check. The Finnish remailer could not have been
&gt;    used, since anon.penet.fi no longer transmits binary image files.
&gt;    Jerry Russell, who runs Florida Online and who looked into the case,
&gt;    says he figures the whole thing was a relatively simple prank called a
&gt;    sendmail spoof, in which the prankster posts a message with a phony
&gt;    return address. He says the Willowick police never produced a copy of
&gt;    the posting for him so that he could unravel the tangle for them.
&gt;    Indeed, when the policeman called, "he didn't really understand what
&gt;    he was trying to tell me," says Russell. "The average Joe Blow police
&gt;    detective doesn't know flip about the Internet."
&gt; 
&gt;    Neither does the average public official. And that, friends, is why
&gt;    stuff like the Communications Decency Act--the Christian Coalition's
&gt;    attempt to remove pornography from the Internet--sails through
&gt;    Congress.
