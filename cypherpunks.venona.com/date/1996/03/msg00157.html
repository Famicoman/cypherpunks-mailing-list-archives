I apologize for those that are out of California, but other wise
please consider helping.  This is a very worth while cause.
This will bring us much closer to educating all the children in 
our schools about what's going on on the internet.  TIA

---------- Forwarded message ----------

&gt;On NetDay96,  March 9, 1996, a hundred thousand volunteers in 
&gt;California
&gt;will go to twelve thousand schools in California, and install the same
&gt;Category 5 wire we use in all California business local area networks.
&gt;We will connect five classrooms and the library to a central closet, 
&gt;in
&gt;preparation for connection to the Internet.  This is a barnraising, a
&gt;kickstart for networking in the schools.
&gt;
&gt;Every high tech employee in California should be involved. Every
&gt;contractor for a high tech company should be involved. Anyone --
&gt;employee, customer, or supplier -- that you can think of who believes
&gt;linking our children to the Internet is a good idea should be 
&gt;involved.
&gt;
&gt;What do you do?  Go to www.netday96.com, find a school, and volunteer 
&gt;to
&gt;help put that school on the Internet on March 9.  Go to that school on
&gt;Saturday, March 9, and help ten other people pull wire from five
&gt;classrooms and a library or computer lab to a central closet -- you 
&gt;don't
&gt;need any particular expertise.  That's it. You can choose a school 
&gt;from
&gt;the twelve thousand home pages created on a server at the Well:
&gt;www.netday96.com.  All schools, private or public, are there; if it 
&gt;has
&gt;more than ten children in a classroom, it's a school -- if you don't 
&gt;see
&gt;your school, mail netday@kqed.org  and NetDay will put up a home page 
&gt;for
&gt;you.
&gt;
&gt;As NetDay approaches, you will see pages go up for every company in
&gt;California supporting NetDay, together with the count of participants 
&gt;from
&gt;each company.
&gt;
&gt;We're jumpstarting the schools.  Our goal is to bring every school in
&gt;California past the first barrier to access: interior wiring.  We then
&gt;use the new capability in the schools to persuade the carriers to 
&gt;provide
&gt;Internet access.  And it's working.
&gt;
&gt;We now have commitments from MCI, Netcom, and ATT to provide free 
&gt;dialup
&gt;a ccess to the Internet for every school in California. Higher 
&gt;bandwidth
&gt;will come next.
&gt;
&gt;We've talked the vendors into creating NetDay Kits that they will ship
&gt;directly to the schools. A standard kit, with two to three thousand 
&gt;feet
&gt;of Cat 5 wire, jacks, a 24-way patch panel, connectors, and cable ties
&gt;will cost between $350 and $500.  Pacific Bell is sponsoring 1,000 
&gt;kits.
&gt;Small electrical contractors are sponsoring two or three schools.
&gt;Individual parents are sponsoring schools.  You can. Your district 
&gt;office
&gt;can.  All details are at the NetDay web site: www.netday96.com.
&gt;
&gt;Please sign up now.
&gt;
&gt;Our first need is to show a groundswell of volunteers.  We announced
&gt;NetDay in San Francisco on January 19, at a school wired by Sun and 
&gt;3Com
&gt;employees on Volunteer Day in November. Vice President Gore arrived to
&gt;praise the volunteers, and thank all California high-technology 
&gt;companies
&gt;participating in NetDay.  Volunteering has taken off, but we need to 
&gt;reach
&gt;ten thousand in the next week or two.
&gt;
&gt;Please volunteer today.
&gt;
&gt;This Web site is the first use of the World Wide Web to organize a 
&gt;mass
&gt;volunteer event.  Please help make it a success.
&gt;
&gt;Please mail this request to anyone on your mailing lists. Please ask 
&gt;all
&gt;webmasters to put a pointer to www.netday96.com on their home page.  
&gt;We
&gt;are organizing this in a totally decentralized way, using the Web.  
&gt;This
&gt;is the first time this has been tried, and I believe the Net can do 
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;We can do it.
