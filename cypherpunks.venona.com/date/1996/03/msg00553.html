&gt;&gt;From: Me 
&gt;&gt;&gt;	A. My previously mentioned problem with a limited but non-libertarian
&gt;&gt;&gt;organization.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't deny that such an organization might spring up.  (Anti-abortion 
&gt;&gt;activists are the group which come most immediately to my mind, BTW.  I'm 
&gt;&gt;not in sympathy with them; quite the opposite.)  I've never claimed that 
&gt;&gt;this system is totally immune to such abuse, in the same way that the seller 
&gt;&gt;of a gun can certify that it will never be used to commit a crime.
+__________^^^     

Ooops! my error, I meant "can't."

&gt;	I understand and agree with the gun argument. However, it's still a
&gt;matter of whether Assasination Politics will overall be better or worse than
&gt;the current system. 

The one thing that disappoints me about the result of my presentation of 
this idea is that I haven't heard any intelligent arguments quantitatively 
arguing that things will be worse.  Other proponents simply agree that the 
system would be better; most of the opponents don't take the trouble to 
quantify their objections.  

&gt;If better, then I'll support it if it becomes necessary (I
&gt;still hope for peaceful (or at least relatively peaceful) change - hopefully,
&gt;it has not become necessary for the Declaration of Independence's 
justification
&gt;of revolution to be reused). If worse, I won't. I won't try to stop you from
&gt;doing so, however (currently, there's no way that I could, for instance).

What's interesting is that you see this; yet there are a number of opponents 
who can't seem to realize that what THEY want (or, for that matter, what _I_ 
want) may be absolutely irrelevant to what is actually going to happen.  

&gt;	Incidentally, by "support" I am meaning making suggestions for
&gt;technical improvements. Admittedly, the degree to which I can do so is limited
&gt;by my lack of technical knowledge, but I believe I have thought of some
&gt;workable refinements.

These are the kind of discussions I'd most want to have.  I understand, 
however, that anybody might hesitate a bit to appear to be actively 
encouraging such a system.  That's why I've decided my best function is to 
be the initiator of the idea, and the primary educator.  Somebody else will 
actually develop the system, probably without telling me anything.


&gt;	As well as the obvious problem of unethical assasinations, there is
&gt;also that of a negative reputation being given to various cypherpunk-liked
&gt;ideas (anonymous remailers, fully anonymous digital cash, etcetera) if someone
&gt;notices this.

Perhaps, but most (non-net-using) people are so unaware of encryption as to 
make this irrelevant, I think.


&gt;&gt;&gt; Moreover, Jim Bell is ignoring the other sources of propaganda than
&gt;&gt;&gt;government in convincing the average person that someone is doing something
&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong (when, by my ethics at least, they aren't) - such as religion and
&gt;&gt;&gt;various organizations like the PFDA.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Again, only a tiny fraction of the population needs to participate...
&gt;
&gt;	However, if more of the population participates, they may do stupid
&gt;things like using an organization that might strike at them - just as they
&gt;currently support a government that can crack down on them. The minority of
&gt;intelligent people - the tiny fraction needed for this to potentially work -
&gt;isn't a factor for this part. In other words, I'm more worried about too _many_
&gt;people - the wrong people - participating rather than too few.

Well, there's not a great deal that we can do to prevent it.  Five years 
ago, I'm sure the then-users of the Internet were fearful of all the newbies 
to come; even today, we may subtly fear those to come.   In other words, 
once WE'RE on the lifeboat, we don't want anyone else to show up!


&gt;&gt;Since "Assassination Politics" is based on a combined-donation system, even 
&gt;&gt;people on a subsistence wage could contribute; a quarter here, a dollar 
&gt;&gt;there, pretty soon it turns into real money.
&gt;
&gt;	That is an argument against it. Do you want the people who give to
&gt;televangelists being able to more directly have people killed than in the
&gt;current system (when at least you've got votes by others to take care of the
&gt;problem)? Unfortunately, the same system of ethics that would make one's
&gt;targets the right ones also excludes the targets (non-governmental figures)
&gt;that can create the problems under this system - like the PFDA leaders.

Have you forgotten what might happen to those same televangelists?

While I'd sure like to be able to design a system where only the "right" 
people die (by my own opinion), I'm under no illusion that this would be 
anything other than a dictatorship under "Jim Bell" or whoever happened to 
be in control.  I think I've done a fairly good job of designing 
(anticipating?) a system that will do a lot of good, hopefully without doing 
a lot of bad.

There may be nothing I can do about the negatives, unfortunately.
