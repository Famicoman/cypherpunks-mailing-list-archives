&gt; Here is an example of what anonymous remailers can

I'm re-forwarding you the second half of this article, because it seems 
clear that you didn't read the whole thing the first time.

&gt; &gt;    Suponcic, being a public official, knew his way around the local
&gt; &gt;    police department, and soon a detective started pounding the Net. By
&gt; &gt;    tracing the header information on the Usenet postings, the detective
&gt; &gt;    determined--O.K., this part is murky, we admit--that the messages had
&gt; &gt;    originated in Ohio, passed through Florida Online, an Internet
&gt; &gt;    provider in the Sunshine State, and then through anon.penet.fi, a free
&gt; &gt;    E-mail remailer service based in Finland that allows Internet users to
&gt; &gt;    post messages anonymously.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    The identity of the poster was, and is, unknown, though Suponcic has
&gt; &gt;    his suspicions. "It's my personal belief that the root of this is
&gt; &gt;    political," says the councilman, who had to get an unlisted telephone
&gt; &gt;    number and whose wife now wants to move.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    On Feb. 6, at Suponcic's urging, the Willowick city council passed a
&gt; &gt;    resolution asking the state and federal governments to close the
&gt; &gt;    "loopholes" that allowed anonymous remailers to operate outside the
&gt; &gt;    authority of U.S. law-enforcement officials. "Once you've achieved one
&gt; &gt;    of these anonymous identities, you're dangerous, and there's no way
&gt; &gt;    law enforcement can track it," Suponcic says. "The animal's out of
&gt; &gt;    control."
&gt; &gt; 

I know you read at least this far, but keep reading...

&gt; &gt;    Still not content, Suponcic contacted Steven LaTourette, the U.S.
&gt; &gt;    Congressman who represents his district. LaTourette's staff suspects
&gt; &gt;    that the problem lies with Julf Helsingius, the Finn who runs the
&gt; &gt;    anonymous remailer. They wrote a letter to the Finnish ambassador and
&gt; &gt;    sent copies to the Secretary of State and the chairman of the House
&gt; &gt;    Committee on International Relations. The State Department agreed last
&gt; &gt;    week to look into the complaint.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    But here's a reality check. The Finnish remailer could not have been
&gt; &gt;    used, since anon.penet.fi no longer transmits binary image files.
&gt; &gt;    Jerry Russell, who runs Florida Online and who looked into the case,
&gt; &gt;    says he figures the whole thing was a relatively simple prank called a
&gt; &gt;    sendmail spoof, in which the prankster posts a message with a phony
&gt; &gt;    return address. He says the Willowick police never produced a copy of
&gt; &gt;    the posting for him so that he could unravel the tangle for them.
&gt; &gt;    Indeed, when the policeman called, "he didn't really understand what
&gt; &gt;    he was trying to tell me," says Russell. "The average Joe Blow police
&gt; &gt;    detective doesn't know flip about the Internet."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    Neither does the average public official. And that, friends, is why
&gt; &gt;    stuff like the Communications Decency Act--the Christian Coalition's
&gt; &gt;    attempt to remove pornography from the Internet--sails through
&gt; &gt;    Congress.

Allow me to adjust your point to "Here's an example of what sendmail 
exploits can do".
