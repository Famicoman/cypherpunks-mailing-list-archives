&gt;A few questions:
&gt;
&gt;1- How does the PC know where it is?
&gt;2- How does the PC know it has been stolen?

The Web reveals all:

1. If the PC has been _reported_ stolen by the owner, any call from that PC
triggers a phone trace, says the company.

2. See #1 (the key is that owner must call and report a particular PC stolen).


&gt;Since this is a software product I am assuming that the answer to #1
&gt;is the use of CallerID on the line when the software calls, which is
&gt;defeated by the use of line blocking by the thief.  The obvious answer
&gt;to #2 seems to me to have the system call the CompuTrace office at
&gt;odd intervals to see if it has been reported stolen yet...
&gt;
&gt;Obvious solution for potential thieves: wipe the disks and reinstall
&gt;an OS once you steal a PC.  This should be done anyway to remove any
&gt;bits of data which might identify the original owner.

These points assume the thief is relatively sophisticated and that the
thief is aware that the CompuTrace system is installed. I suspect that
neither is likely, at least not until the system gets sufficient publicity
so that the first thing thieves and purchasers of suspected-to-be-hot PCs
do is to make plans to avoid this (reformat disks, etc.).

I think the scenario I described in my earlier post on this topic covers
about 97% of all PC thefts: relatively unsophisticated thieves who
warehouse the merchandise until buyers are found. The buyers, in turn, are
also relatively unsophisticated. They may be immigrant businesses looking
for a really good deal on PCs, they may be school systems strapped for
cash, they may be your mother buying her first PC at a flea market.

And they may be any of us, buying a surplus PC.

In none of these cases is the user likely to take steps to disable Caller
ID (and the company may actually do old-fashioned tracing).

&gt;Conclusion:  Yet another useless piece of software riding the
&gt;computer security bandwagon.

I'm not convinced it's software I would want to buy, but it fills a niche,
I think. And it's definitely not the snake oil we've seen recently, as it
makes no outrageous technical claims and seems to be going after a limited
market.
