&gt; &gt; &gt; One issue that hasn't been addressed by the s.c.r.m robomod is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility of persistent nyms: that is, Alice D. Nonymous somehow makes
&gt; &gt; &gt; her public key known to the robomod; and later if someone submits an articl
&gt; &gt; &gt; via some anon remailer claiming to be hers, it would be rejected if the
&gt; &gt; &gt; signature doesn't check. Of course, her true submissions would be accepted
&gt; &gt; &gt; from any remailer. How could such protocol be implemented?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We see no problem with user posting under pseudonyms, as long as they do
&gt; &gt; not try to pretend to be other real people and do not constantly mutate,
&gt; &gt; and submit their messages to the robomoderator for consideration.
&gt; 
&gt; On the contrary, I was thinking of a situation when a person is posting through
&gt; an anonymous remailer, yet wishes to establish a persistent nym that can't be
&gt; impersonated. E.g., someone may submit articles via remailers (different every
&gt; time) and have a signature 'Alice D. N.'; what's to prevent someone else from
&gt; submitting an article and also signing it 'Alice D. N.'?
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of allowing the user to add a 'From: &lt;nym&gt;' in the first
&gt; paragraph of the PGP-signed block. To establish the nym, Alice would first
&gt; post her public key under the name of Alice; then she would post things like
&gt; 
&gt; From: remailer@somewhere
&gt; 
&gt; -- begin pgp signed msg
&gt; 
&gt; From: Alice
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; This would also address the problem of someone's misconfigured system where
&gt; his submissions appear to come from moron@camelot.ptu.edu or
&gt; moron@pendragon.ptu.edu or some other random hostname.
&gt; 

As far as I understand, the problem boils down to this:

   Nym users want to have an identity (belief of other users that
   a set of articles originating from many anonymous addresses were in
   fact written by one person). At the same time, we want to prevent
   users who do not have a permanent return address from using
   addresses of other persons.

One of the problems with allowing users to specify return addresses in
the letters is a possibility of forgery: what if
Mallory@evil-services.com posts a MAKE MONEY FAST message, and specifies
that her "From: " address should be Popugaev@get_high.edu? Such posting
could get Mr. Popugaev in trouble.

Maybe the following rewriting rule may be a good compromise between
functionality and security, for PGP signed messages:

1. Original "From: " address is rewritten as "X-Origin" or some such.

2. "From:" address is always set to the main user ID of the PGP key that
was in the signature.

3. For "Reply-To: " we use "Reply-To: ", if it is present, then we try
"From: ", and if "From: " is not present, "Reply-To: " is not set.

4. If "Subject: ", "Date: ", "Message-ID: ", or "Newsgroups: " is
present on the block of pseudo-headers starting with the first line of
the text, use them instead of trusting the headers of an email.

This way, we achieve the following results: 

1. Positive and reliable identification of users is possible to every
reader of soc.culture.russian.moderated, not only to moderators;

2. Users gain additional protection from man-in-the-middle attacks by
using well protected pseudo-headers withing PGP signed blocks; they
cannot misuse this feature by lying about who they are;

3. Those who do not want to bother do not have to;

4. People with misconfigured email addresses may have at least
some address field ("From: ") set correctly.

5. Nyms can post freely through any anon remailers and always have their
identity show up in the "From: " field, even if remailers do not allow
users to specify their identity at all.

Note that I agree that we need to have a database of MD5 checksums of all
submissions and carefully process duplicates.

What do you think?

	- Igor.
