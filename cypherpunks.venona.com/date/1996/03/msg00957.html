&gt;&gt;"Software to the rescue:
&gt;&gt;If somoeone steals your PC, you may be able to get it back because of
&gt;&gt;software that acts as a kind of tracking device. Home Office Computing
&gt;&gt;magazine reports that the software CompuTrace TRS will automatically dial
&gt;&gt;the office of its creator, Absolute Software, if a thief hooks up a stolen
&gt;&gt;PC's modem to a phone line. The software reveals the location of the PC and
&gt;&gt;Absolute Software will call the police" - Providence Journal-Bulletin -
&gt;&gt;March 12, 1996.

&gt;1- How does the PC know where it is?
&gt;2- How does the PC know it has been stolen?
&gt;
&gt;Since this is a software product I am assuming that the answer to #1
&gt;is the use of CallerID on the line when the software calls, which is
&gt;defeated by the use of line blocking by the thief. 

I think that 1-800 services provide caller ID information to the company or 
organization that pays for the service.  Whether or not this is blocked by 
standard caller-ID I don't know.   Nevertheless, like you, I am not 
impressed with the likelihood of success of this system.

&gt; The obvious answer
&gt;to #2 seems to me to have the system call the CompuTrace office at
&gt;odd intervals to see if it has been reported stolen yet...

One thing that might be useful would be a OTP (one-time programmable) EPROM 
chip installed on all major system components (monitor, HD, motherboard, 
CDROM drive, maybe even DRAM SIMMs).  It would be a serial device for low 
cost, such as a 3-pin TO-92 chip, which would have a capacity of about 4k 
bits, enough to store a hash of the owner-history (at about 100 bits per 
owner) for any owner that decided to leave a record. Like an EPROM, bits 
could only be written once; the chip itself would prevent write-overs 
previous to the last-written bit. 

Subsequent owners could read the history and publish the hash codes; anyone 
looking for such a stolen product could have their losses checked 
automatically, and perhaps semi-anonymously or anonymously, by a service set 
up to do this.  Innocent owners could be adequately compensated for finding 
a piece of stolen hardware, to the extent that nobody is deterred about 
reporting a find.
