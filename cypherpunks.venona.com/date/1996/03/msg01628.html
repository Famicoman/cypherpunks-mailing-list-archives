It was only months ago that they passed a bill raising alot of speed limits
to the 75mph range.

&gt;&gt;They just recently repealed the national 55 MPH speed limit.  Even though it
&gt;&gt;was repealed by law, in the same way it was passed, plenty of people have
&gt;&gt;argued that the Federal government has no jurisdiction in this area.  Those
&gt;&gt;arguments are absolutely valid, even if they were ignored.  The danger in
&gt;&gt;giving the government implicit authority in areas not mentioned in the
&gt;&gt;Constitution is that it is not clear how far such justification extends.
&gt;
&gt;Actually, the national government didn't even *pretend* it had jurisdiction
&gt;here.  Instead, they used an indirect approach -- they passed laws which
&gt;denied some of the existing highway funding to states with higher speed
&gt;limits than 55 MPH.  (Later this limit was raised to 65 MPH, given some
&gt;additional restrictions such as proximity to population centers.)
&gt;
&gt;Any and all states were perfectly free (in theory) to ignore this "national
&gt;speed limit" and set any limit or no limit at all.  In practice, no states
&gt;exercised this hypothetical freedom, because they had already grown dependent
&gt;on highway funds provided by the national government.  Thus, through indirect
&gt;pressure exerted through the funding mechanisms, the national government was
&gt;able to usurp perogatives which were clearly in the domain of the states.
&gt;
&gt;The national government has expanded greatly in size and powers in times of
&gt;war and national crisis.  In particular, FDR spearheaded the massive growth
&gt;of the national government in response to the Great Depression, and it has
&gt;continued to grow ever since.  More and more often, the national government
&gt;usurps traditional state's roles, even in situations of unquestionable state
&gt;jurisdiction such as national speed limits.  The elastic clause was one key
&gt;tool used for this expansion.
&gt;
&gt;Another key tool is the commerce clause, which has been seriously abused to
&gt;secure new powers for the national government.  I don't think I'll go into it
&gt;right now...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If the government can limit us to 55, then why can't they limit us to 40-bit
&gt;&gt;keys?
&gt;
&gt;The national government didn't impose 55 MPH speed limits on us, the states
&gt;did it under national pressure.  As for whether they can legitimately limit
&gt;cryptography use and technology, we don't have any clear answer yet, in any
&gt;legal precedent.  Of course, most of us hold the opinion that cryptography
&gt;should be considered Constitutionally protected as free speech, but politics
&gt;get involved when these things get decided...
