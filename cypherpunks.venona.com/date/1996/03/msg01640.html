 let me tell ya' I live in Central Texas and regularly use I-35, which was
the primary highway considerd for the bill. The speed limits were raised to
75 mph at increments of every 4 to 5 miles. By that I mean the minute you
pass the sign that says 75 with good eyes you can see the one up ahead that
says 65 or 55 and you might even catch a glimpse of the state trooper parked
beside it. I personally think its a joke and an inconvience, I was totally
for the the bill as it was stated but this "red light, green light" game is
very disapointing. Just goes to show the government still can't do anything
right.

                                        Chevelle out....

&gt;&gt;Actually, the national government didn't even *pretend* it had jurisdiction
&gt;&gt;here.  Instead, they used an indirect approach -- they passed laws which
&gt;&gt;denied some of the existing highway funding to states with higher speed
&gt;&gt;limits than 55 MPH.  (Later this limit was raised to 65 MPH, given some
&gt;&gt;additional restrictions such as proximity to population centers.)

&gt;&gt;It was only months ago that they passed a bill raising alot of speed limits
&gt;&gt;to the 75mph range.
&gt;
&gt;To be precise, Congress repealed the laws which had pressured states into the
&gt;55/65 MPH speed limits.  Once this happened, a number of states either took
&gt;advantage of it immediately to raise speed limits, or are considering it...
&gt;Other states don't intend to raise the limits.  In Montana, you can now drive
&gt;at *any* speed legally, in the daytime.  So if you want to go 100 MPH, head to
&gt;Montana...  :-)
