&gt;&gt;&gt; If I rent cars, someone might one day use a car rented from me in a

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is an unfair analogy.  Now if you had said that you rented cars
&gt;&gt;without asking for proof of identification, thus making your car hire
&gt;&gt;centre very useful to robbers, that may more closely resemble the
&gt;&gt;anon-remailer situation.
&gt;
&gt;If a hotel rents a room to someone who commits a crime in that room, e.g.,
&gt;prostitution, drug use, plotting to blow up a building, can the hotel be
&gt;seized under the asset forfeiture laws?

I didn't initially use the the car-hire analogy, I was just trying to
bring it more into line with the anon-remailer situation.  Perhaps a
better example would be an agency set up for the sole purpose of hiring
cars on behalf of anonymous customers - as long as the customers didn't
abuse the anonymous facility too much, then I guess they would be allowed
to carry on operating, much like the remailers operate at present.
However, I guess they're in for trouble when their service starts being
abused at the expense of big brother, and I guess their policy of shredding
all evidence at weekends won't help matters either.


&gt;If I let someone use my telephone without confirming his identity, am I
&gt;liable for crimes committed with this phone?
&gt;
&gt;This last example is, I submit,  a nearly perfect parallel to anonymous
&gt;remailers. And not because the telephone system is a "common carrier," but
&gt;because of scienter: I have no knowledge, and cannot be expected to have
&gt;knowledge, of crimes committed with my phone.

But this doesn't match the remailer scenario - this example is better
likened to me letting you use my email account whilst at my house.


&gt;And, finally, packages and letters may be mailed anonymously. This is what
&gt;pre-paid stamps are all about. And I've used non-U.S. Postal Service
&gt;package delivery sytems without providing identification. Can Federal
&gt;Express have their assets seized because of "anonymous remailing"?
&gt;(Quibblers will no doubt cite laws requiring FedEx to "cooperate," demand
&gt;ID, etc.)

Yes, but when was the last time someone physically mailed copyright source
code (eg RC2) to half the world?  When was the last time a pair of lawyers
made worldwide news due to making a phone call?
Again, the anon-postal-mail/anon-telephone-call analogy doesn't work.
