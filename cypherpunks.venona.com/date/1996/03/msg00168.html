On Mon, 4 Mar 1996, Anonymous (or so he thinks!) wrote:

&gt; &gt;Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous
&gt; &gt;remnailers in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic.
&gt; &gt;Marlow said that the government runs at least a dozen remailers and that
&gt; &gt;the most popular remailers in France and Germany are run by the
&gt; &gt;respective government agencies in these countries. In addition they
&gt; &gt;mentioned that the NSA has successfully developed systems to break
&gt; &gt;encrypted messages below 1000 bit of key length and strongly suggested
&gt; &gt;to use at least 1024 bit keys. They said that they semselves use 1024
&gt; &gt;bit keys.
&gt; 
&gt;      I don't know about everyone else, but I consider this, if true, to be a 
&gt; MAJOR worry.  It never ceases to amaze me how lightly the government takes 
&gt; lying to the people.  Unfortunately I don't have the contacts or resources 
&gt; to do any further investigation, I hope this thread is resolved one way or 
&gt; another soon.

Yeah, didn't you know that Sameer was on the CIA payroll? How do you 
think he paid for his new Ferrari?

I have no doubt that the CIA can break 1000-bit keys on a case-by-case
basis, *if they decide to allocate the resources*. I think it's possible
that some remailers are run by spooks. However, I seriously doubt that
anyone is breaking stuff routinely, and I think the web of trust is pretty
good. Of course, the CIA had Ames... the reverse could easily be true. 

However, I also have no doubt that Strassmann and Marlow are spreading
disinformation and exaggerating their capabilities in an attempt to break
the web of trust and incite a witch hunt. It won't work. The answer in any
case is more use of remailers, not less. Just turn up the noise level. 
You already know that nothing is 100% secure, but you do what you can. 
It's a war of attrition.
