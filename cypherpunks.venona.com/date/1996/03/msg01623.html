Though some will petulantly claim that this has "nothing to do with
crypto," I think the report on legislation which may lead to new levels of
national identification is very apropos to the themes of this list. A
national ID card could be tied in to the CDA and other such legislation:
the "Internet Driver's License" we are worried about. This would also
facilitate the criminalization of anonymous remailers.

(I noticed at a local night spot large posters announcing the city's "Zero
Tolerance" policy for passing a drink to a minor. Imagine the same folks
passing laws about the criminalization of giving access to a minor....)

Here's the forwarded article:

&gt; Here is the latest Alert from The Law Loft.  Sorry its
&gt; late.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are benifitting by this information, please don't just
&gt; keep it to yourself - share it with someone immediately.  And
&gt; perhaps you can Fax Suzanne and Pete a thank you and ask
&gt; them what you can do to help.
&gt; 
&gt; This work is pretty lonely and grinding.  And oh so few ever thank 
&gt; you for it. Of course that's not why their doing it.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of you could do the same thing I'm doing.  You can listen to
&gt; 7.435 MHz at 8:00 pm EST and take notes from The Law Loft.  You
&gt; can FAX them a request to send you information.  You can then pass 
&gt; it on to others.
&gt; 
&gt; When you don't see anything from me out here, you can pitch in and do
&gt; it.  This is late, because I had no other choice but to catch an early
&gt; train.
&gt; 
&gt; Throw away the "boob" tube and stop wasting your precious little time
&gt; that we have left to learn and work together.  Invest in a good
&gt; Short-Wave radio with a built in tape machine.  I use the Radio Shack
&gt; DX-392 portable receiver.  NO LICENSE REQUIRED TO LISTEN.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out other fine alternative news programs on 5.065 between 6:00
&gt; pm EST and 12:00 midnight week nights.
&gt; 
&gt; Please help us - do your little part.
&gt; 
&gt; For Freedom,

&gt; H.R. 2202 Immigration Bill
&gt; 
&gt; Special Alert II
&gt; 
&gt; March 19, 1996  [Please note this date when reading - Kerry] * * * * *
&gt; * * *
&gt; 
&gt; H. RES. 384 bringing H.R. 2202 and 17 proposed amendments to the floor
&gt; passed today in the House.  Debate on the bill and amendments
&gt; continues tomorrow. Vote on amendment number 4 is expected tomorrow:
&gt; 
&gt;         The picture in the House of Representatives grows darker.  H.R. 384
&gt; bringing H.R. 2202, the Immigration bill, to the floor for a vote
&gt; along with 17 proposed amendments passed easily by wide majority in
&gt; today's session.
&gt; 
&gt;         Work on amendments including Congressman McCullum's amendment no. 4
&gt; will start up again tomorrow.  We estimate that the vote on amendment
&gt; number 4 will occur about 3:00 pm EST.
&gt; 
&gt; Both the House and Senate bills are intended to bring us some form of
&gt; universal biometric identifier i.d. card either in the form of a new
&gt; social security card or a passport linked to biometric identifier
&gt; birth certificates and drivers' licenses:
&gt; 
&gt;         The House bill, H.R. 2202, if passed will bring in the biometric
&gt; identifier slowly with greater subtlty than the Senate version.  The
&gt; biometric identifier is clearly in the picture here.  Here's why:
&gt; 
&gt;         1) The report of the U.S. Commission on Immigration entitled U.S.
&gt; Immigration Policy: Restoring Credibility talks openly about the use
&gt; of biometric identifiers for driver's licenses on page 65.  Key
&gt; language throughout the report dealing with fraudulent use of
&gt; identifying documents also leads to only one place - introduction of
&gt; the biometric identifier form of identification.
&gt; 
&gt;         2) The NarcOfficer, official publication of international narcotics
&gt; enforcement officer association in its September/October 1995 issues
&gt; states point blank that a universal biometric identifier system is
&gt; intended for use by everyone on the planet.
&gt; 
&gt;         3) The Senate bill formerly S. (unumbered) now split into S. 269 and
&gt; S. 1361 in sections 111-116 talks about birth certificates with
&gt; ‘fingerprint or other biometric data'.  The same section talks about
&gt; new driver's licenses with ‘fingerprint or other item of biometric
&gt; data'.
&gt; 
&gt;         4) The Hoke Amendment to H.R. 2202 added by the House Judiciary
&gt; Committee talks about a ‘demonstration pilot project with a reliable,
&gt; easy to use, confirmation mechanism'.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;         5) The McCullum amendment, no.4 on the calendar of amendments to H.R.
&gt; 2202 talks about creating an official document that ‘offers the best
&gt; possible security against counterfeiting, forgery, alteration, and
&gt; misuse'.  And provides for creating a new social security card that
&gt; would be ‘as secure against fraudulent use as United States passport'.
&gt; Part of the catch here is which version of the passport?  The Senate
&gt; bill provides for the creation of anew fraud resistant passport.
&gt; 
&gt;         The McCullum amendment would make the new technology binding on all
&gt; social security cards issued after January 1, 1999.  Beginning on
&gt; January 1, 2006, all employers would be required to verify employment
&gt; eligibility with the new social security card.
&gt; 
&gt; Any way you cut it, this is too much authority to invest in any
&gt; government!
&gt; 
&gt;         Our founding fathers knew that only way to be free and remain free is
&gt; to constrain the power of the government.  As John Dickinson said in
&gt; 1768 in Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania: "For who are a free
&gt; people?  Not those, over whom government is reasonably and equitably
&gt; exercised, but those, who live under a government so constitutionally
&gt; checked and controlled that proper provision is made against it being
&gt; otherwise exercised".
&gt; 
&gt;         Creation of a mandatory, universal biometric identifier identification
&gt; system lets the genie out of the bottle.  It would gut the 4th
&gt; Amendment's right of provacy and let the government surveil and
&gt; control us instead of vice versa.
&gt; 
&gt; What to do now:
&gt; 
&gt;         We need at least 100,000 phone calls and faxes in Washington by
&gt; tomorrow.  We may not win in the House but we have to try.  Remember
&gt; if we build up steam now in the House our chances will be better later
&gt; in the Senate.
&gt; 
&gt;         Contact your congressman tonight by fax (best) or tomorroww by phone
&gt; (good).  Argue with him, politely.  He might think that just because
&gt; amendment 4 says it won't be used as a universal identifier, that
&gt; amendment 4 and the bill are okay.  Remind him what happened to the
&gt; social security card.  It was supposed to be voluntary too in the
&gt; beginning.  
&gt; 
&gt;         As time permits, contact as many congressmen as you can in California,
&gt; New Mexico, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois.  These congressmen are
&gt; going to be under especially heavy pressure to pass the bill no matter
&gt; what it says.  You can use the toll-free numbers for your call: (800)
&gt; 962-3524, (800) 972-3524, or (800) 872-8513.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell them we want to keep the 4th Amendment to the Constitution and
&gt; the only way to do that is to kill the 4th amendment to the bill.
&gt; Tell them that we are not at all amused by the hidden joke of using an
&gt; amendment 4 to kill the 4th Amendment to our Constitution.  No, no, no
&gt; to any version of the biometric identifier!  Vote no to H.R. 2202!
