&gt;          ELECTRONIC FRONTIER CANADA (EFC) --- PRESS RELEASE
&gt;
&gt;(For immediate release --- February 27, 1996)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;                "Freedom to Read" in Cyberspace
&gt;
&gt;        A few members of Electronic Frontier Canada have
&gt;        developed an amusing and interactive Web page
&gt;        to celebrate 'Freedom to Read Week'.
&gt;
&gt;The Internet, some people say, is out of control and in need
&gt;of strict government regulation.  But just what might a censored
&gt;Internet look like?
&gt;
&gt;One possible answer to that question is given by the "Black Thursday Machine",
&gt;an interactive Web page that was the brainchild of three multimedia designers:
&gt;Brian Hall, Andrew Chak, and Rob Stanley.  Stanley is also a member of the
&gt;online civil-liberties organization Electronic Frontier Canada.
&gt;
&gt;"Black Thursday Machine" Web pages:     <A  HREF="http://www.vex.net/~brian/Censored">http://www.vex.net/~brian/Censored</A>
&gt;                                        <A  HREF="http://www.hyperactive.net/censored">http://www.hyperactive.net/censored</A>
&gt;
&gt;The "Black Thursday Machine" invites Internet surfers who visit the site
&gt;to type in the address of their favourite Web page, to see what it might
&gt;look like if a Canadian version of the new and controversial American
&gt;"Communications Decency Act" were put into effect.
&gt;
&gt;The "Black Thursday Machine" will fetch any page you request, but it
&gt;presents you with a censored version.  The algorithm it uses is simple
&gt;and unsophisticated -- but these are the same kinds of rules recently
&gt;used by America Online and CompuServe when they blocked access to
&gt;discussions including the words "gay", "sex", or "breasts".
&gt;
&gt;"Any naughty word is replaced by the word 'CENSORED' in bright red,"
&gt;says Rob Stanley, who was the chief programmer.  Which words are on
&gt;the forbidden list?  "It works just like government censorship,"
&gt;says Stanley, "you don't get to choose.  It's an arbitrary process."
&gt;
&gt;The Web site has links to a few representative examples, including pages
&gt;about "Breast Feeding", "Safe Sex", "Planned Parenthood", and help for
&gt;troubled "Gay Youth", that are rendered almost unintelligible by the
&gt;crude censorship.
&gt;
&gt;"Despite well-intentioned desires to protect children,"
&gt;says Jeffrey Shallit, vice-president of Electronic Frontier Canada,
&gt;"adults need to be able to communicate freely about controversial issues.
&gt;Otherwise, we'll reduce the level of discussion on the Net to
&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh."  Paraphrasing a U.S. Supreme Court Justice,
&gt;Shallit said that censoring the net to protect children is
&gt;like "burning down your house in order to roast a pig".
&gt;
&gt;"The 'Black Thursday Machine' demonstrates the ravages of censorship
&gt;in an amusing and provocative manner", says David Jones, president of EFC.
&gt;"I hope people will take a moment during 'Freedom to Read Week' to visit
&gt;the web site because it illustrates what the wired world might look like
&gt;if artistic expression, vigourous debate, and all the subtley of human
&gt;communication and interaction were subjected to the cold, calculating,
&gt;and heartless scrutiny of a machine that filters out what the government
&gt;might deem as controversial, offensive, or just plain inappropriate for
&gt;the eyes of its citizens."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; * Why "Black Thursday" ?
&gt;
&gt;New and harsh restrictions on what can be communicated through American
&gt;computer networks were signed into law on Thursday, February 8th, 1996
&gt;-- "Black Thursday".  "This sent a shock wave through the Internet,
&gt;where concerned individuals around the world "Painted the Web Black"
&gt;for 48 hours as a sign of protest," says David Jones, EFC president.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; * About "Freedom to Read Week" in Canada (February 26 to March 3)
&gt;
&gt;"The purpose of 'Freedom to Read Week'," says Sandra Bernstein,
&gt;"is to encourage Canadians to think about and reaffirm their commitment
&gt;to intellectual freedom, as guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and
&gt;Freedoms."  Sandra Bernstein, also a member of Electronic Frontier Canada,
&gt;represents the Periodical Writers Association of Canada on the
&gt;Book and Periodical Council's Freedom of Expression Committee,
&gt;which sponsors 'Freedom to Read Week' each year.
&gt;
&gt;Bernstein also maintains an online "Chronicle" which documents challenges
&gt;to Freedom of Expression in Canada:
