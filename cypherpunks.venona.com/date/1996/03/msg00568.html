&gt; &gt;Making art more palatable or less "extreme" to curry favor with
&gt; &gt;corporate patrons, or to get that NEA grant, or to get that faculty
&gt; &gt;position is self-censorship, and it does happen.
&gt; 
&gt; No, it does not.  Making art more palatable is simply the process of 
&gt; free trade between two uncoerced entities.  If the artist does not offer
&gt; what the corporate purchaser wants he will not sell.  He thus adapt his
&gt; style out to his customer.  Nobody is threatening to use force to
&gt; have the artist conform to the client.  Nobody is forcing the client 
&gt; to buy what he does not like.
&gt; 
&gt; The artist does not have to compromise, he simply have to refuse the 
&gt; contract.
&gt; 
Well, my did is an artist, and I have to say that you really have to 
consider the "human" aspects of it before you rattle off refusing 
contracts for art.  Artists do art because they think they're good at it, 
or prefer art as a career field more than any other, presumbably.  When 
you have to feed a) yourself b) your family, taking contracts seems that 
much more palatable.  I admit, I don't like it either, but, to use a far 
more philosophical arena, sometimes people make the sacrifices that they 
do ( in terms of integrity and pride ) for the long run.  Sometimes 
people feel they have no choice at any point in their lives.  Sometimes 
people have nothing BUT artistic integrity.  Those who take the latter 
often get the respect of other artists, but respecting one's example is not 
the same as following one's example; who knows how many years of 
suffering you have to go through before you make it, if you make it at 
all ( case in point; Van Gogh, who only sold 1 painting his entire life ).
This argument may not seem all too relevant to this forum until you 
consider integrity of information, and start to consider how much one is 
and is not willing to sacrifice to others, say the authorities or to a 
society, in the first place.  It becomes quite important then; admittedly 
in a roundabout way.

&gt; &gt;critici.. by JFA T. QC, Canada@citene 
&gt; &gt;&gt; There is no such thing as "self-censorship".  Either you stick to 
&gt; &gt;&gt; your values, and then it is *not* censorship, or then you do not,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and then, it is neither.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Self-censorship does happen, and it's a growing problem in the arts
&gt; &gt;community. (I'm not a commercial artist, so this is my understanding
&gt; &gt;from other panelists and speakers at a conference I spoke at last month.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Anybody using the term "censorship" to describe that is in the following
&gt; situation : he *wants* the advantages of the contract (money) without
&gt; respecting the customer, therefore.  He deplores the fact that somebody
&gt; (the customer) can act to his best judgment.  The fact that the artist
&gt; calls that censorship shows that he have the same thought process as
&gt; the true censorers, i.e. the conviction that the end justify the means,
&gt; and more specifically, the feeling that *his* ends justify *any* means.
&gt; 
&gt; The artist may not act on his feelings but nevertheless, they are, in
&gt; essence, of this nature.
&gt; 
&gt; And unfortunately, too many artists think that way.
