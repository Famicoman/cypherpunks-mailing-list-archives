Thanks for the sources.  More money is going to get dumped into cryptobooks
soon.  (I am amazed how little exists on the web on the topic.) I had seen a
few of the books at a local bookstore, but I was uncertain of their quality.
(They also had a number of snake-oil crypto books.)

&gt;However, these books are based on work done in WWII and the following
&gt;decade(s), so the stuff is pretty dated. Still, nearly any "snake oil
&gt;crypto" system, such as it sounds like your friend is building, will likely
&gt;be far weaker than the ciphers the NSA was attacking back in the early
&gt;days.

The author has failed to call me back.  I do have some serious concerns
about the code.  (There is not a single XOR used, except to clear
registers!)  I am starting to suspect that it is based on a mathematical
progression based on the numbers 40, 28, 36.  I need to spend a bit of time
on the code with a debugger to find out just where that segment of code is
located.  (Should not take too long...  Just have to make the time.)

&gt;* The journal "Cryptologia" is largely devoted to amateur cryptanalysis.

The web info for back issues listed a web page from a publisher that had no
listing for them on the server.  I will be sending mail to get more info...

&gt;&gt;The Cyphernomicon has a couple of paragraphs, but nothing on
&gt;&gt;techniques or pointers to other references.  RSA's FAQ has
&gt;&gt;little to nothing as well. A web search turned up little
&gt;&gt;useful. Most of the other references I have found have been for
&gt;&gt;current cyphers, but next to nothing about breaking them.
&gt;
&gt;There are very good reasons to say little about "conventional
&gt;cryptanalysis": it just doesn't matter much with modern ciphers, such as
&gt;public key systems. Modern ciphers don't fall to conventional attacks based
&gt;on word frequency, pattern analysis, etc.

Still an interesting topic...

&gt;Your friend is on a hopeless task. If he doesn't understand just how
&gt;hopeless it is to develop a homegrown, conventional cipher then he's
&gt;certainly not likely to take the time to become a skilled amateur
&gt;cryptanalyst.

I am trying to convince him of the futility of the task.  (It is hard as his
ego keeps getting in the way.)  I just want to give him reasons why it is
weak and not just glittering generalities.

Thanks again for the book references!
