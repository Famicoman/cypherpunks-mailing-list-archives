I doubt the age figure, and would want to see confirmation before using it.
Certainly most people I deal with on the Net seem to be younger than 30-35,
though this may be a reasonable _average_ (if not _median_). But the rest
of the stats fit.

&gt;It may come as no suprise then that Internet users as a group could have life
&gt;experiences significantly different than a majority of the population.
&gt;Similarily, their views may also be in the minority. On the other hand, they do
&gt;hold a majority of the technological power.
&gt;
&gt;Revenge of the Nerds is one phrase that I have heard.

An old movie name, of course. And "Triumph of the Nerds" was the name of
the recent PBS/Mark Stevens program. (I hate the term "nerd," as I hate the
names "dweeb," "geek," "jerk," etc. Believe me, anyone who thinks being
called a "nerd" is complimentary, or anyone who labels himself as a "geek,"
is probably one who would call himself a "nigger," or a "queer.")

&gt;&gt;Even meant humorously ("&gt;;-)"), many of us would dispute the notion that &gt;a

&gt;
&gt;And what or who guarantees that this later, better job exists. Much of what I
&gt;read today suggests that McJobs may become the norm for many.

"Guarantees"? You ask "what or who guarantees" a better job? I am speechless.

There are no guarantees, friend. Not in this reality. Jobs are not
something created by the stroke of a Presidential pen--jobs are what we
call the exchange of labor or brainpower for money or other considerations.
If Alice wants a new roof, and Bob offers to roof her house for a price she
think is reasonable, this is a "job" for Bob. And so on.

&gt;Can you image working at a low paying job for your entire life. I personally
&gt;can't. I work hard and am doing well for myself. Like most of those here,
&gt;crypto
&gt;would be a benefit for me. On the other hand, unlike most of the population, I
&gt;could join Mensa if I applied. My point: I'm not average and I suspect that
&gt;neither are you or most of those here. How do you make the cypherpunks agenda
&gt;(on the days that there is one ;-) of widespread concern to the average
&gt;citizen?

I don't, actually. As to "working at a low paying job...", it's a matter
for them to work out, perhaps by getting new skills, perhaps by working two
jobs, perhaps by opening a business. The statistics on where wealth was
created in the 1985-95 period show it overwhelmingly came from new
entrepreneurial efforts.



&gt;I'm having a hell of a time getting my e-mail read because I'm too busy

Not a persuasive argument.
