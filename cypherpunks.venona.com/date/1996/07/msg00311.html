	It's interesting but actually unsurprising that they're looking at the
cash cards before they are the Internet money exchange stuff. They haven't
spotted exactly how much of a difference the latter can make - the former will
act about like cash at "worst" from their viewpoint.

&gt;   Reuters New Media
   
&gt;   _ Friday July 5 12:27 PM EDT _
   
&gt;G10 mulls effect of E-cash on policy and fraud
   
&gt;   ZURICH - The threat of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion from
&gt;   new electronic payment systems will be high on the agenda of Monday's
&gt;   monthly meeting of Group of 10 (G10) central bankers at the Bank for
&gt;   International Settlements (BIS).
   
&gt;   The central bank governors will be briefed on two reports that examine
&gt;   the implication of emerging forms of payment -- electronic purses,
&gt;   e-cash, cybercash -- on monetary policy and whether it will open the
&gt;   way to widespread fraud.
   
&gt;   With big banks already waging a fierce battle to set a new global
&gt;   standard for electronic cash, central bankers want to stay on top of a
&gt;   technology that is not only likely to destabilize monetary aggregates,
&gt;   but also holds out the promise a cashless society and threatens the
&gt;   monopoly of central banks to issue notes and coins.
   
&gt;   William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve and
&gt;   chairman of the G10 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, will
&gt;   brief his colleagues on electronic money and fraud, money laundering,
&gt;   counterfeiting, tax and legal issues.
   
&gt;   The other report, to be presented by Charles Freedman, Bank of Canada
&gt;   deputy governor, explores the issue of electronic money and monetary
&gt;   policy.
   
&gt;   Whether G10 governors take action or merely note the reports and let
&gt;   them fade into the BIS archives is uncertain. An initial decision will
&gt;   probably be taken at the meeting.
   
&gt;   The two reports will focus mainly on the implications of prepaid cards
&gt;   rather than so-called network money, cybercash or digital cash as the
&gt;   latter is less developed.
   
[...]

&gt;   The concept of electronic money covers a wide range of new payment
&gt;   methods ranging from multi-purpose, rechargeable prepaid cards, such
&gt;   as Mondex, to forms of digital cash or cybermoney that enable shoppers
&gt;   to pay for goods over the Internet.
