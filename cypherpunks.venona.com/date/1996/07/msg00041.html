&gt;                  ARE THE FEDS SNIFFING YOUR RE-MAIL?
&gt; 
&gt;                             by Joh Dillon
&gt; 
&gt;      THE RULES OF PRIVACY ARE CHANGING WITH ELECTRONIC
&gt;      COMMICATIONS, THE EAGERNESS OF GOVERNMENT TO PRY INTO OUR
&gt;      COMMINICATIONS, APPARENTLY, IS NOT.
&gt; 
&gt; Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies are actively monitoring
&gt; worldwide Internet traffic and are allegedly running anonymous
&gt; re-mailer" services designed to protect the privacy of electronic
&gt; mail users.
&gt; 
&gt; The startling claim that government snoops may be surreptitiously
&gt; operating computer privacy protection systems used by private
&gt; citizens was made earlier this year at a Harvard University Law
&gt; School Symposium on the Global Information Infrastructure. The
&gt; source was not some crazed computer hacker paranoid about government
&gt; eavesdropping. Rather, the information was presented by two defense
&gt; experts, Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Strassmann, now
&gt; a professor at West Point and the National Defense University in
&gt; Washington, D.C., along with William Marlow, a top official at
&gt; Science Applications International Corp., a leading security
&gt; contractor.
&gt; 
&gt; Anonymous re-mailer services are pretty much what the name implies.
&gt; By stripping identifying source information from e-mail messages,
&gt; they allow people to post electronic messages without traceable
&gt; return address information.
&gt; 
&gt; But Strassmann and Marlow said that the anonymous re-mailers, if
&gt; used properly and in tandem with encryption software pose an
&gt; unprecedented national security threat from information terrorists.
&gt; Intelligence services have set up their own re-mailers in order to
&gt; collect data on potential spies, criminals, and terrorists, they
&gt; said. *1
&gt; 
&gt; Following their Harvard talk, Strassmann and Marlow explicitly
&gt; acknowledged that a number of anonymous re-mailers in the US are run
&gt; by government agencies scanning traffic," said Viktor
&gt; Mayer-Schoenberger, a lawyer from Austria who attended the
&gt; conference. Marlow said that the [US] government runs at least a
&gt; dozen re-mailers and that the most popular re-mailers in France and
&gt; Germany are run by respective agencies in those countries."2
&gt; 
&gt; Mayer-Schoenberger was shocked by the defense experts' statement and
&gt; tried to spread the news by sending an e-mail message to Hotwired,
&gt; the online version of Wired magazine. Although the story did not
&gt; make headlines, his note quickly became the e-mail message relayed
&gt; 'round the world, triggering over 300 messages to Strassmann and
&gt; Marlow. It was followed by the electronic version of spin control.
&gt; 
&gt; Strassmann quickly posted a denial. In an interview, he said the
&gt; Austrian completely misunderstood what he and Marlow had said. That
&gt; was false," Strassmann said of Mayer-Schoenberger's message. That
&gt; was the person's interpretation of what we said. ... We did not
&gt; specifically mention any government. What we said was that
&gt; governments are so heavily involved in this [Internet issues] that
&gt; it seems plausible that governments would use it in many ways." *3
&gt; (Marlow did not return a call for comment.)
&gt; 
&gt; But Harvard Law School Professor Charles Nesson, who heard the
&gt; original exchange at the Harvard conference, recalls the
&gt; conversation as Mayer-Schoenberger described it. *4
&gt; Mayer-Schoenberger also stands by his story. I remember the
&gt; conversation perfectly well," he e-mailed from Vienna. They said a
&gt; couple of additional things I'm sure they don't want people to
&gt; remember. But the statement about the re-mailers is the one most
&gt; people heard and I think is quite explosive news, isn't it?" *5
&gt; 
&gt; Marlow said that actually a fair percentage of re-mailers around the
&gt; world are operated by intelligence services, Mayer-Schoenberger
&gt; recalled in a subsequent interview. Someone asked him: `What about
&gt; the US, is the same true here as well?' Marlow said: `you bet.'
&gt; 
&gt; The notes for the Harvard symposium, posted on the World Wide Web,
&gt; also lend credence to Mayer-Schoenberger's account. The CIA already
&gt; has anonymous re-mailers but to effectively control [the Internet]
&gt; would require 7,000 to 10,000 around the world," the notes quote
&gt; Marlow as saying. *6
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; @EASE WITH EAVESDROPPING
&gt; 
&gt; Prying into e-mail is probably as old as e-mail itself. The Internet
&gt; is notoriously insecure; messages are kept on computers for months
&gt; or years. If they aren't stored safely, they can be viewed by anyone
&gt; who rummages through electronic archives by searching through the
&gt; hard drive, by using sophisticated eavesdropping techniques, or by
&gt; hacking in via modem from a remote location. Once e-mail is
&gt; obtained, legally or not, it can be enormously valuable. Lawyers are
&gt; increasingly using archived e-mail as evidence in civil litigation.
&gt; And it was Oliver North's e-mail (which he thought was deleted) that
&gt; showed the depths of the Reagan administration's involvement in the
&gt; Iran-Contra affair.
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, it's easier to tap e-mail messages than voice telephone
&gt; traffic, according to the paper written by Strassmann and Marlow. As
&gt; e-mail traffic takes over an ever-increasing share of personal
&gt; communications, inspection of e-mail traffic can yield more
&gt; comprehensive evidence than just about any wire-tapping efforts,
&gt; they wrote. E-mail tapping is less expensive, more thorough and less
&gt; forgiving than any other means for monitoring personal
&gt; communications. 7
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; @ RISK
&gt; 
&gt; Two kinds of anonymous re-mailers have evolved to protect the
&gt; privacy of users. The first, and the less secure, are two-way
&gt; database re-mailers," which maintain a log linking anonymous
&gt; identities to real user names. These services are more accurately
&gt; called pseudonymous" re-mailers since they assign a new name and
&gt; address to the sender (usually a series of numbers or characters)
&gt; and are the most vulnerable to security breaches, since the logs can
&gt; be subpoenaed or stolen. The most popular pseudonymous" re-mailer is
&gt; a Finnish service at anon.penet.fi".
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that if you want protection against a governmental body,
&gt; you would be foolish to use anon.penet.fi," said Jeffrey Schiller,
&gt; manager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer
&gt; network and an expert on e-mail and network security. Last year, in
&gt; fact, authorities raided anon.penet.fi to look for the identity of a
&gt; Church of Scientology dissident who had posted secret church papers
&gt; on the Internet using the supposedly private service. *8
&gt; 
&gt; The second kind of re-mailers are cypherpunk" services run by
&gt; computer-savvy privacy advocates. Someone desiring anonymity detours
&gt; the message through the re-mailer; a re-mailer program removes
&gt; information identifying the return address, and sends it on its way.
&gt; Schiller says that a cypherpunk re-mailer in its simplest form is a
&gt; program run on incoming e-mail that looks for messages containing a
&gt; request-re-mailing-to" header line. When the program sees such a
&gt; line, it removes the information identifying the sender and remails"
&gt; the message. *9 Some re-mailers replace the return address with
&gt; something like nobody@nowhere.org."
&gt; 
&gt; Further protection can be obtained by using free, publicly available
&gt; encryption programs such as Pretty Good Privacy and by chaining
&gt; messages and re-mailers together. Sending the message from re-mailer
&gt; to re-mailer using encryption at each hop builds up an onion skin
&gt; arrangement of encrypted messages inside encrypted messages. Some
&gt; re-mailers will vary the timing of the outgoing mail, sending the
&gt; messages out in random sequence in order to thwart attempts to trace
&gt; mail back by linking it to when it was sent.
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; @ISSUE: THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY
&gt; 
&gt; Linking encrypted messages together can be tricky and
&gt; time-consuming. So who would bother? A. Michael Froomkin, an
&gt; assistant professor of law at the University of Miami and an expert
&gt; on Internet legal issues, says anonymity allows people to practice
&gt; political free speech without fear of retribution. Whistleblowers
&gt; can identify corporate or government abuse while reducing their risk
&gt; of detection. People with health problems that are embarrassing or
&gt; might threaten their ability to get insurance can seek advice
&gt; without concern that their names would be blasted electronically
&gt; around the world. *10 A battered woman can use re-mailers to
&gt; communicate with friends without her spouse finding her.
&gt; 
&gt; The Amnesty International human rights group has used anonymous
&gt; re-mailers to protect information supplied by political dissidents,
&gt; said Wayne Madsen, a computer security expert and co-author of a new
&gt; edition of The Puzzle Palace, a book on the National Security
&gt; Agency. Amnesty International has people who use re-mailers because
&gt; if an intelligence service in Turkey tracks down [political
&gt; opponents] ... they take them out and shoot them," he said. I would
&gt; rather err on the side of those people. I would rather give the
&gt; benefit of the doubt to human rights." *11
&gt; 
&gt; Strassmann and Marlow, on the other hand, see the threat to national
&gt; security as an overriding concern. Their paper, Risk-Free Access
&gt; into the Global Information Infrastructure via Anonymous Re-mailers,
&gt; presented at the Harvard conference, is a call to electronic arms.
&gt; In it, they warn that re-mailers will be employed in financial fraud
&gt; and used by information terrorists" to spread stolen government
&gt; secrets or to disrupt telecommunication, finance and power
&gt; generation systems. Internet anonymity has rewritten the rules of
&gt; modern warfare by making retaliation impossible, since the identity
&gt; of the assailant is unknown, they said. Since biblical times, crimes
&gt; have been deterred by the prospects of punishment. For that, the
&gt; criminal had to be apprehended. Yet information crimes have the
&gt; unique characteristic that apprehension is impossible. ...
&gt; Information crimes can be committed easily without leaving any
&gt; telltale evidence such as fingerprints, traces of poison or
&gt; bullets," they wrote. *12
&gt; 
&gt; As an example, they cite the Finnish re-mailer (anon.penet.fi),
&gt; claiming that it is frequently used by the ex-KGB Russian criminal
&gt; element. Asked for proof or further detail, Strassmann said: That
&gt; [paper] is as far in the public domain as you're going to get." *13
&gt; 
&gt; At the Harvard symposium, the pair provided additional allegations
&gt; that anonymous re-mailers are used to commit crimes. There was a
&gt; crisis not too long ago with a large international bank. At the
&gt; heart of the problem turned out to be anonymous re-mailers. There
&gt; was a massive exchange around the world of the vulnerabilities of
&gt; this bank's network," Marlow said. *14
&gt; 
&gt; But David Banisar, an analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based
&gt; Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) downplayed this kind of
&gt; anecdote, saying that such allegations are always used by
&gt; governments when they want to breach the privacy rights of citizens.
&gt; I think this information warfare stuff seems to be a way for the
&gt; military trying to find new reasons for existence and for various
&gt; opportunistic companies looking for ways to cash in. I'm really
&gt; skeptical about a lot of it. The problem is nine-tenths hype and
&gt; eight-tenths bad security practices," he said. Already existing
&gt; Internet security systems like encryption and firewalls could take
&gt; care of the problem."
&gt; 
&gt; The public should not have to justify why it needs privacy, he said.
&gt; Why do you need window blinds? Privacy is one of those fundamental
&gt; human rights that ties into other human rights such as freedom of
&gt; expression, the right to associate with who you want, the right to
&gt; speak your mind as you feel like it. ... The question shouldn't be
&gt; what do you have to fear, it should be `Why are they listening in?'
&gt; With a democratic government with constitutional limits to
&gt; democratic power, they have to make the argument they need to listen
&gt; in, not the other way around." *15
&gt; 
&gt; Froomkin, from the University of Miami, also questioned Strassmann
&gt; and Mayer's conclusions. First of all, the statistics about where
&gt; the re-mailers are and who runs them are inaccurate. I can't find
&gt; anybody to confirm them," he said. I completely disagree with their
&gt; assessment of facts and the conclusions they draw from them. ...
&gt; Having said that, there's no question there are bad things you can
&gt; do with anonymous re- mailers. There is potential for criminal
&gt; behavior." *16
&gt; 
&gt; Banisar doubts that intelligence agencies are actually running
&gt; re-mailers. It would entail a fairly high profile that they tend to
&gt; shy away from, he said. However, it is likely that agencies are
&gt; sniffing" monitoring traffic going to and from these sites, he said.
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; @ WORK SNIFFING THE NET
&gt; 
&gt; Not in doubt, however, is that the government is using the Internet
&gt; to gather intelligence and is exploring the net's potential
&gt; usefulness for covert operations. Charles Swett, a Department of
&gt; Defense policy assistant for special operations and low-intensity
&gt; conflict, produced a report last summer saying that by scanning
&gt; computer message traffic, the government might see early warnings of
&gt; impending significant developments." Swett added that the Internet
&gt; could also be used offensively as an additional medium in
&gt; psychological operations campaigns and to help achieve
&gt; unconventional warfare objectives." *17 The unclassified Swett paper
&gt; was itself posted on the Internet by Steven Aftergood of the
&gt; Federation of American Scientists.
&gt; 
&gt; The document focuses in part on Internet use by leftist political
&gt; activists and devotes substantial space to the San Francisco-based
&gt; Institute for Global Communications (IGC), which operates Peacenet
&gt; and other networks used by activists. IGC shows, Swett writes, the
&gt; breadth of DoD-relevant information available on the Internet."
&gt; 
&gt; The National Security Agency is also actively sniffing" key Internet
&gt; sites that route electronic mail traffic, according to Puzzle Palace
&gt; co-author Wayne Madsen. In an article in the British newsletter
&gt; Computer Fraud and Security Bulletin, Madsen reported that sources
&gt; within the government and private industry told him that the NSA is
&gt; monitoring two key Internet routers which direct electronic mail
&gt; traffic in Maryland and California.18 In an interview, Madsen said
&gt; he was told that the NSA was sniffing" for the address of origin and
&gt; the address of destination" of electronic mail.
&gt; 
&gt; The NSA is also allegedly monitoring traffic passing through large
&gt; Internet gateways by scanning network access points" operated by
&gt; regional and long-distance service providers. Madsen writes that the
&gt; network access points allegedly under surveillance are at gateway
&gt; sites in Pennsauken, N.J. (operated by Sprint), Chicago (operated by
&gt; Ameritech and Bell Communications Research) and San Francisco
&gt; (operated by Pacific Bell). *19
&gt; 
&gt; Madsen believes that NSA monitoring doesn't always stop at the US
&gt; border, and if this is true, NSA is violating its charter, which
&gt; limits the agency 's spying to international activities. People
&gt; familiar with the monitoring claim that the program is one of the
&gt; NSA's `black projects,' but that it is pretty much an `open secret'
&gt; in the communications industry," he wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; Electronic communications open up opportunities to broaden
&gt; democratic access to information and organizing. They also provide a
&gt; means and an opportunity for governments to pry. But just as people
&gt; have a right to send a letter through the post office without a
&gt; return address, or even to drop it in a mail box in another city, so
&gt; too, electronic rights advocates argue, they have the right to send
&gt; an anonymous, untraceable electronic communication. And just as the
&gt; post office can be used maliciously, or to commit or hide a crime,
&gt; re-mailers can be used by cruel or criminal people to send hate mail
&gt; or engage in flame wars." And like the post office, the highways,
&gt; and the telephone, the Internet could be used by spies or
&gt; terrorists. Those abuses, however, do not justify curtailing the
&gt; rights of the vast number of people who use privacy in perfectly
&gt; legal ways.
&gt; 
&gt; Robert Ellis Smith, editor of the Privacy Journal newsletter, said
&gt; government agencies seem obsessed with anonymous re-mailers. They
&gt; were set up by people with a very legitimate privacy issue, he said.
&gt; Law enforcement has to keep up with the pace of technology as
&gt; opposed to trying to infiltrate technology. Law enforcement seems to
&gt; want to shut down or retard technology, and that's not realistic.
&gt; Anonymous re-mailers are not a threat to national security. *20
