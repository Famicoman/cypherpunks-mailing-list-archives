&gt;The security guard Jewell is now confirmed to be the prime suspect. While
&gt;NBC News is reporting that no evidence _directly_ links him to the bombing,
&gt;the evidence against him is overwhelming:
&gt;
&gt;1. He is overweight. With the exception of The Unabomber, most perps in
&gt;cases like this are fat.

After all, who could *not* want to conform with crowd?  Anyone who isn't
obsessed with being thin must have something wrong with him.  There ought
to be a law against people like him!

&gt;2. They found a _shotgun_ in his cabin.

Only a criminal would have a reason for that! After, what legitimate use
could a citizen have with one? If he wants to hunt, he should use a
rifle!

&gt;3. He had an interest in guns. (Back issues of "Guns and Ammo" are bad
&gt;enough, but possession of even a single issue of "Combat Handguns" is
&gt;sufficient to convict in 39 of the 50 states.)

Particularly for a cop! Why would anyone in his position need *that*!

&gt;4. News sources are reporting that authorities who searched his apartment
&gt;and his cabin "came up empty," which surely implies that he planned this
&gt;crime with the help of others.

We can take prime examples of this:  The Whitehouse hiring dilemna - if
they can't figure out who hired him, there must be someone in on the job!
 Maybe it's the dead guy. Maybe it's those evil Internet users...

Sorry about breaking your sarcasm-meter...

&gt;(P.S. I, too, was convinced Jewell was the guy. But in recent hours it is
&gt;looking like a "rush to judgment" could be involved. There is strong
&gt;pressure to "solve the crime" by the close of the Olympics on Sunday.)

I think we could track this to the replacement of literature and culture
with TV - if everyone from T.J. Hooker to Agents Sculley and Mulder solve
a mystery in 30 minutes, surely they can do it in real life, too.

How much do you want to bet that if it is a frame and it is successful,
they'll "find" a PGP encrypted file with plans and use it to promote GAK?
