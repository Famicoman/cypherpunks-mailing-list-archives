mix@rebma.mn.org is a new Mixmaster style remailer.

I used to run a mixmaster remailer as well as a cypherpunks
remailer at rebma.mn.org...  The keys for both of those remailers
were lost in a disk crash last fall.  I had a little one in the hospital at
the time, so I never got around to straightening the situation out.
(Their addresses were remailer@rebma.mn.org and mixer@rebma.mn.org.
I've just let those remailers lapse.  Sorry.)

Also, my connection for email is via a UUCP link that is polled hourly.
Do not expect quick turnaround on remailed messages.  List pingers
please note.  This can be a disadvantage or an advantage depending on your
needs and expectations.

Here is the key information:
