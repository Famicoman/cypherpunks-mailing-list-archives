&gt; This, and similar remarks by others, consistently misses the point which I
&gt; have been making for about a year now, and which Director Freeh finally
&gt; made explicit in his testimony last week. That is--the government is
&gt; concerned with mass market software incorporating robust crypto, used
&gt; overseas, and recognizes that they can't keep niche products off the
&gt; market, nor stop bad guys from using crypto the government would just as
&gt; soon they didn't. Since the US has a hammerlock on that mass market, and
&gt; since few would switch products to let the crypto tail wag the features dog
&gt; (no slur intended), ITAR follows.
&gt; 

Hrmmm... "is concerned" I can understand, but banning it, or what we do
with it, is definatly against the First Amendment.

&gt; 
&gt; Though I've no connection with Freeh, it's interesting that his language is
&gt; almost word for word the same as what I've been using. Do you suppose some
&gt; of his staff reads my stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; Until now we haven't seen such an open public admission of what the
&gt; government is concerned about--probably because the State Department
&gt; doesn't like to have an official spokesman admit we're mass monitoring and
&gt; seining foreign traffic since it is an embarassment to the polite fiction
&gt; of diplomatic relations (though I'm sure the truth is that every country
&gt; with the capability does it).
&gt; 

yes, I'd say that every country that can does... but what does that have
to do with anything?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[..]
&gt; &gt;&gt;    with wiretapping. Mr. Freeh, testifying at Thursday's hearing in
&gt; &gt;&gt;    favor of an optional key escrow plan, noted that the point is not
&gt; &gt;&gt;    to prevent all  copies of uncrackable code from going abroad --  that's
&gt; &gt;&gt;    clearly impossible -- but to prevent such high-level code
&gt; &gt;&gt;    from becoming the international standard, with architecture
&gt; &gt;&gt;    and transmission channels all unreadable to world
&gt; &gt;&gt;    authorities. To software companies and Internet users who
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So why should criminals bother with using standards if they are
&gt; &gt;readable by authorities?
&gt; 
&gt; See above.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;    have been clamoring for the right to encrypt as securely as
&gt; &gt;&gt;    possible, Mr. Freeh and others argue, "the genie is not yet
&gt; &gt;&gt;    out of the bottle" on "robust," meaning uncrackable,
&gt; &gt;&gt;    encryption.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Are they going to magically erase all copies of strong software that
&gt; &gt;is already currently available? (Side note: the Pacifica news report
&gt; &gt;on Friday notes that while Freeh gave his testimony, over 100 copies
&gt; &gt;of PGP were downloaded from MIT's site.)
&gt; 
&gt; What he's saying is that US-exported copies of the Lotus Lockshens,
&gt; Microsoft Machayas, and Netscape Niguns of the world still do not contain
&gt; robust crypto the USG cannot read.
&gt; 

Which they should, I might add.

&gt; &gt;Particularly absent in the WaPo-ed is that many do not trust the
&gt; &gt;authorities (in the US and elsewhere)--particularly the FBI, which
&gt; &gt;has a long history of extra-legal surveillance.
&gt; 
&gt; So as Netanyahu says at length we need to build in protections against
&gt; abuses, using both the legislature and the judiciary.
&gt; 

Oh, yes oh wise one.  We need protections against free speech.  The First
Amendment was designed to hurt us.  Seig Hiel!
