&gt;Experts point out differences in Atlanta, TWA incidents

&gt;   _(c) Copyright Nando.net_
   
&gt;    The Associated Press
    
&gt;   WASHINGTON -- With nerves already on edge after the suspicious downing
&gt;   of TWA Flight 800, the bombing at the Olympic Games in Atlanta on
&gt;   Saturday renewed concerns about U.S. safeguards against terrorism.
   
&gt;   But analyses by security experts drew important distinctions between
&gt;   the incidents, and politicians cautioned against measures that would
&gt;   limit liberties.
   
&gt;   Investigators have not officially determined what caused the Flight
&gt;   800 tragedy, but if the jetliner was brought down by terrorists it was
&gt;   a relatively sophisticated operation.
   
&gt;   By comparison, the device in Atlanta was easy to make and detonated in
&gt;   an easily accessible place. "I don't believe that a pipe bomb would
&gt;   have taken down that TWA plane," said a Treasury agent, who requested
   anonymity.
   
&gt;   Another federal investigator noted differences between the Atlanta
&gt;   attack and Middle Eastern terrorists who often use high-powered truck
&gt;   bombs. And domestic militia groups tend to focus on government
&gt;   buildings, not crowds.
   
&gt;   James Alan Fox, the dean of Northeastern University's criminal justice
&gt;   school and a student of criminal behavior, said there are basically
&gt;   two motivations for bombers: revenge and attention.
   
&gt;   "The desire to make a statement can be that of a well-organized
&gt;   terrorist group that uses the victims as pawns to advance their cause,
&gt;   or it could be someone who is just interested in feeling important,"
&gt;   he said.
   
&gt;   Given the recent rise of violent anti-government groups, Fox
&gt;   speculated that a militia sympathizer might use such an event to grab
&gt;   the spotlight.
   
&gt;   "Through an amateurish bombing like this, he can feel like he's part
&gt;   of the movement," Fox said. "He can elevate his sense of importance."
   
[...]
  
&gt;   And building one is almost as simple. "If you don't know how to do it,
&gt;   there are any number of books available ... that will teach you
&gt;   explicitly, step-by-step, how to manufacture the device," Vitch said.
   
[...]

&gt;   House Speaker Newt Gingrich stressed that security was already high at
&gt;   the Olympics, and cautioned against adopting a "police state"
&gt;   mentality.
   
&gt;   "If a terrorist is nutty enough, there's always an opportunity for
&gt;   tragedy," he said, appearing after Nunn on CNN. "A free people can't
&gt;   back down."
