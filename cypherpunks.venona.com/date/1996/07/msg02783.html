&gt;Which is a long way to say that street cops

Most demands for ID and conformations with police involve the operation of
motor vehicles.  I have never been "IDed" except at border crossings and
when I was operating motor vehicles.  Clean and dressed up people are rarely
IDed on foot.  Maybe you should mention some of the specific practices in
Seattle that disturb you.

&gt;So the unconstitutional and oppressive character of the various laws
&gt;Mike Duvos refers to is mitigated by their lack of evenhanded enforcement.
&gt;If a cop can demand ID from someone who "looks like he doesn't belong here"
&gt;he can demand it from you. (modulo driving, this isn't legal. But give
&gt;Justice [sic] Rehnquist and Clinton and random congressional maniacs a few
&gt;more years and see where things stand.)

Or flying on a commercial flight.  So far, prosecutions for "failure to
possess ID" have not succeeded.  You *can* be prosecuted for failure to
identify yourself (which is *not* the same thing).  The Philadelphia airport
was allegedly requiring *two* pieces of ID for flights.  If they are talking
about two pieces of photo -- government-issued ID, I wonder where the 80% of
Americans without a Passport (x the 90% of Americans who are not government
employees) get the second piece of ID. [Is it a violation of something if
you Heil Hitler od Sieg Heil the airline clerk when they ask to see your ID.
It's not a threat, it's an expression of honor.]

&gt;with guns or other weapons. And just as some people "don't have a right to
&gt;live in Seattle" if they won't toe the line, other people may find they
&gt;"don't have a right to live in the United States." * 

The Supremes outlawed exile as a punishment in a case during the 1950s.
Said it was cruel and unusual punishment.  Guess it's OK to execute people
but not deprive them of having a government.

"If the security guard did it in Atlanta, that will be the second US
Olympics in which the only 'terrorist incident' was perpetrated by a
security person.  I guess we should outlaw security at such gatherings to
prevent terrorism."
