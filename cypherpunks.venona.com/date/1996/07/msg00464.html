The Systemics Cryptix crypto library for Java is now available for
download at <A  HREF="http://www.systemics.com/software/">http://www.systemics.com/software/</A>

The library is FREE FOR COMMERCIAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE.

Apart from much tidying up, there have been several signigicant additions
to the library, including a Blowfish implementation, RSA encryption
(including key generation routines), CFB and CBC block cipher mode modules,
and a cryptographically secure random InputStream.

Enjoy!

                CRYPTIX 1.1 - CRYPTOGRAPHIC EXTENSIONS FOR JAVA


     _________________________________________________________________

                                  DESCRIPTION

   This library contains a suite of cryptographic classes for Java. Some
   of the classes have been implemented in native code for performance
   reasons, and have been tested on Windows 95, Windows NT, Solaris,
   Linux and IRIX.

   The package documentation is available on line.

                                   FEATURES

   All of the following have been implemented:
     * java.crypt.BlockCipher
       This class is a base class for all block ciphers.
     * java.crypt.Blowfish (based on code from A.M. Kuchling, Bryan Olson
       and Bruce Schneier)
       An implementation of Bruce Schneier's Blowfish block cipher.
     * java.crypt.CipherFeedback
       A class for implementing the cipher feedback mode of block cipher
       encryption.
     * java.crypt.CSRandomStream
       A cryptographically secure pseudo random input-stream.
     * java.crypt.DES (based on code from Eric Young)
       An implementation of the DES block cipher.
     * java.crypt.HashMD5
       An class encapsulating MD5 hashes.
     * java.crypt.HashSHA
       An class encapsulating SHA hashes.
     * java.crypt.IDEA
       An implementation of the IDEA block cipher algorithm. Based on
       native libraries.
     * java.crypt.MD5 (based on code from RSA Data Security, Inc.)
       An implementation of the MD5 message digest algorithm. Based on
       native libraries.
     * java.crypt.MD5OutputStream
       An output stream the creates an MD5 hash of its input.
     * java.crypt.MessageDigest
       A base class for all messsage digest algorithms.
     * java.crypt.MessageDigestOutputStream
       A class for using message digest functions to hash an output
       stream.
     * java.crypt.MessageHash
       A base class for classes encapsulating hashes.
     * java.crypt.rsa.PublicKey
       An RSA public key.
     * java.crypt.rsa.RSAKeyGen
       A class for generating RSA public/secret key pairs.
     * java.crypt.rsa.SecretKey
       An RSA secret key.
     * java.crypt.SHA (based on code from NIST and Peter C. Gutmann)
       An implementation of NISTs SHA message digest algorithm. Based on
       native libraries.
     * java.crypt.SHAOutputStream
       An output stream the creates an SHA hash of its input.
     * java.crypt.StreamCipher
       A base class for stream ciphers.
     * java.math.BigInteger (based on code from Eric Young).
       This class implements arbitrary length integers and some
       associated mathematical functions. Based on native libraries.
     * java.math.MPI
       A class for converting BigIntegers to and from MPI format
       integers.
     * java.math.PRNG
       A class for generating a pseudo random sequence with a period of
       2**160.
     * java.math.RandomStream
       An input stream that is random.
     * java.math.TestPrime
       A class for testing the primality of BigIntegers.
