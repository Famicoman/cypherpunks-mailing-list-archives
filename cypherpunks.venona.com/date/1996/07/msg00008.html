&gt; &gt; I stand by my statements.
&gt; 
&gt; Then you have lost all your reputation with me. If you don't even have
&gt; the integrity to admit that you are wrong, you are obviously not a
&gt; reasonable source of information.

How typically Perry.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, MD5 (and MD4) have not been completely cracked.  The problems that 
&gt; &gt; you bring up have to do with situations where an active attacker develops a 
&gt; &gt; slightly different pair of documents with the same hash.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that is "cracked" under most definitions of cryptographic
&gt; hashes, Mr. Ogren. A cryptographic hash is supposed to be useable in a
&gt; signature precisely because it is supposed to be computationally
&gt; infeasable to find two documents with the same hash. Whether both
&gt; documents are chosen by the attacker or only one is immaterial -- the
&gt; property as stated is independant of that. As things stand, you can
&gt; get someone to sign a contract saying "I agree to pay David F. Ogren
&gt; $100" and turn it into one saying "I agree to pay David F. Ogren
&gt; $2395.39" or some such. If that isn't "cracked" what would be
&gt; "cracked"? Yes, it could be worse, but is this not far more than bad
&gt; enough?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Although this is highly undesirable characteristic for a hash function, and 
&gt; &gt; shows a weakness in the function that may eventually lead to its being 
&gt; &gt; completely cracked, it does not mean that a fraudulent document can be 
&gt; &gt; created from an already signed document.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever you like, Mr. Ogren.
&gt; 
&gt; Perry

Perry, as you are so fond of quoting Dobbertin, let me forward once again to 
the list Hans' analysis of the "crack" that he discovered.  He explicitly 
agrees with Mr. Ogren's analysis.  Yes it is prudent to move away from MD5.
But there are still plenty of uses where it is more than sufficient.

&gt;   &lt;dobbertin@skom.rhein.de&gt; wrote (Re: "MD5 discussion"):
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;In view of the continuing discussion about MD5, I want to make a few comments,
&gt; &gt;which hopefully can help to avoid some misunderstandings and misinterpretations:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;1. In February 1996 my paper "Cryptanalysis of MD4" appeared (Fast Software
&gt; &gt;Encryption, Cambridge Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences, 
&gt; &gt;vol. 1039, Springer-Verlag, 1996, pp. 71-82). In this paper, as an example two
&gt; &gt;versions of a contract are given with the same MD4 hash value. Alf sells his
&gt; &gt;house to Ann, in the first version the price is $176,495 and in the second it is
&gt; &gt;$276,495. The contracts have been prepared by Alf. Now if Ann signs the first
&gt; &gt;version with $176,495 then Alf can altered to price to $276.495 ...
&gt; &gt;In principle this risk occurs, if you use a hash function for which (senseful) collisions
&gt; &gt;can be found,  whenever you allow another person to have influence on the 
&gt; &gt;contents of a document you are signing. Certainly this does not happen
&gt; &gt;very often in practical applications. But sometimes you *must* have an agreement
&gt; &gt;about a text (contract) which is then signed by two or more parties. And these are
&gt; &gt;often just the most important applications!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;2. I suspect that the recent attack on MD5 compress can be refined and extended
&gt; &gt;such that it might lead to MD5 collisions (matching the right IV) and perhaps then
&gt; &gt;even to similar results as already obtained for MD4. Certainly this requires a lot of 
&gt; &gt;hard additional work.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;3. If you write a message for your own (nobody else has influence on it) and sign
&gt; &gt;it using MD5 (and a strong public key algorithm, of course) then there is no danger 
&gt; &gt;that it can be altered (at least according to our knowledge today)! Thus it is true
&gt; &gt;that I guess almost all of you will have no risk using MD5, for instance in PGP.
&gt; &gt;However, if you accept 2., then in some cases there could be problems ... 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;4. After all I have reservations against keeping MD5 as a (de facto) standard, 
&gt; &gt;because 2. might indicate that there is a serious security problem with MD5.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;5. My conclusions are: no reason for panic, but in future implementations better
&gt; &gt;move away from MD5.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;6. Presently a paper discussion the status of MD5 in detail is in preparation.
&gt;
