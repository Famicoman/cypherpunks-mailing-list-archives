 &gt;  It is interesting to note that while both groups have opposite
 &gt;  objectives (Hackers want all information free, where cypherpunks want
 &gt;  everbody to be able to have privacy), and yet in there own ways, they
 &gt;  are both right.

 In&gt; I don't entirely agree with this.  I think both groups want
 In&gt; information to be free, but also want people to be able to have
 In&gt; privacy.  Most hackers (used in the sense of people who break into
 In&gt; computers) attack computers owned by such companies as TRW and the
 In&gt; phone companies.  Both of these systems have little regard for privacy.
 In&gt; Most non-malicious hackers promote system security, but at the same
 In&gt; time, don't like government-controlled monopolies and agencies to be
 In&gt; able to keep secret information that should be free.  A very
 In&gt; interesting paper by Dorothy Denning (she used to be regarded very
 In&gt; highly by the hacker community before she started to support Clipper)
 In&gt; expresses some of the concerns and morals of hackers.  It's called
 In&gt; "Concerning Hackers Who Break Into Computer Systems" and is in Phrack
 In&gt; issue 32. 
 &gt; 
 I have read the file (I have all Phracks from the beginning.  Crypt is
 good too, but they dont have the same level of information as Phrack) 
 and I though that it was very inciteful (sp).


 &gt;  I think what we need to define is the diffrence between hackers and
 &gt;  crackers. A hacker breaks into a computer like a cracker (but the 
 &gt;  similarities end there).  The hacker just want to look and learn, 
 &gt;  possably "map out" the system just to see how everything works with
 &gt;  everything else.  Crackers break into computers for the sake of 
 &gt;  destroying or stealing information or the system itself.

 In&gt; That's debatable.  I think many people incorrectly consider these
 In&gt; terms to be mutually exclusive.  There are many hackers (used in the
 In&gt; sense defined in the Jargon File) who also break into systems and could
 In&gt; therefore be considered crackers also.  Most hackers definitely have
 In&gt; the knowledge to break into computer systems, but many crackers aren't
 In&gt; very well versed in programming and learn how to break into computers
 In&gt; by using canned programs and G-files. 
 
 I am saying that hackers do break into computers, but crackers are more
 malicious in their intent.  And yes, pathetic hackers rely on programs.
 I have respect for hackers who do all the work themselfs.
 
 &gt; 
 &gt;  Both cypherpunks and hackers think that the government is wrong
 &gt;  in many things that they do.

 In&gt; Agreed.
