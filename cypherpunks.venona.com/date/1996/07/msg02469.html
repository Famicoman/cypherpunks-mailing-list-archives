IMO, the US does not have a comfortable lead. It's already falling

Are they going to magically erase all copies of strong software that 
is already currently available? (Side note: the Pacifica news report 
on Friday notes that while Freeh gave his testimony, over 100 copies 
of PGP were downloaded from MIT's site.)

&gt;    Encryption, if widely used, could conceivably ease some 
&gt;    privacy problems concerning who gets to see personal and

And evidence cannot be encrypted.  You cannot encrypt an airplane 
full of cocaine or an unusually expensive car baught by money from 
drugs, espionage, etc.  Nor can you encrypt bomb-making materials, 
nor conversations in a room (from your mouth to a telephone 
receiver).  Nor will encryption do anything about informants inside 
the communications loop. etc. etc....

&gt;    the encryption enthusiasts' desire for free development

It's not clear that terrorism can be tracked, even if it's unencrypted.
The OK and WTC bombings were apparently not encrypted, and there's 
some allegations that the authorities had advanced warnings of the 
latter.

The controls haven't done much to prevent free software from being 
exported.  They only control commercial sales of software (and 
hardware).

Particularly absent in the WaPo-ed is that many do not trust the 
authorities (in the US and elsewhere)--particularly the FBI, which
has a long history of extra-legal surveillance.
