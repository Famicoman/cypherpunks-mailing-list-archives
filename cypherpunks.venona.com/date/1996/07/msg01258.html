I have had guns, bad dreams and guests in my house all at the 
same time, many times.  So far, I've managed to avoid shooting
anyone.

&gt; Imagine that you have a guest who at 4am woke up and went to
&gt; the bathroom. Then you see a bad dream how you are being
&gt; robbed, see the guy in the dark, forget that he is your guest,
&gt; and shoot him. Not very pretty, huh?

Not pretty but fortunately very unlikely.  I can imagine 
everything you said except forgetting someone is in my house.  
When I have someone under the mantle of my protection, my senses 
and my awareness are *hightened* not reduced. 
 
Okay, so this is my excuse to tell my L.Neil Smith gun story.
On my way driving to the East Coast, I stopped over for a night
with Smith.  If you are familiar with his writing you might
imagine that his house is no stranger to firearms.  That night
I got up to (guess what) go to the bathroom.  On my way back
to the couch where I was sleeping, I was attacked by...
Neil's cat.  It reached out from under a table and scratched my
foot.  I was afraid he would go for my face or something once I
was asleep again, so I went to Neil's room to ask him to put the
cat someplace.  Neil, wearing nothing but his shorts and a BIG
.44 automag came out to see what I wanted.  I told him and he
put the cat in the basement.  I thanked him and said the gun
wasn't necessary as I didn't want him to shoot the cat.  His
response was, "I wasn't planning on shooting the cat."  Gulp!
And yet I live.  I'll trust a gunnie over a jackbooted ninja
any time and any place.
