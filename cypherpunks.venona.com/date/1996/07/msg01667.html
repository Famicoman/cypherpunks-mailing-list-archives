&gt; &gt; I've seen these sudden destructive impulses in kids many times.
&gt; 
&gt; So have I, but your assertion begs the question.  In an unarmed
&gt; society, people don't have to curb their impulse to the extent
&gt; they do in an armed one.  As a result they often don't.  The
&gt; Swiss and the Israelis seem to avoid internecine fratricide, even
&gt; though guns are everywhere.  I don't think it is any coincidence
&gt; that incivility and casual violence have increased in America in
&gt; direct proportion to the ongoing orgy of victim disarmament.
&gt; 
... snip ...

&gt; Powerlessness is far more a cause of impulsive rages than the
&gt; trust, responsibility and empowerment engendered by gun ownership.
&gt; 

As I said, the kid who hit me in the head with a stick was 3-4 years
younger than me. You skipped that part. Correspondently, I could beat
him easily (I did, but his mother soon interrupted me), which was
obvious to him. So he had plenty of information that would deter a
rational person. He had all the reasons to "to curb his impulse", as
you said, and he could have thought about his punishment.

Still, he hit me. He was NOT a rational person, therefore. Just as
simple as that, that particular kid who hit me should not be trusted
with a firearm at his age.

This is a simple logical conclusion.

Your arguments apply to people who do not do impulsive things. To adults
for example. 

Again, I expressed my opinion about raising my own kids. I do not
have an opinion on whether parents in general should be allowed to
give guns to their kids or not, but I would not keep a firearm  in 
my home when I have kids. I may teach them gun safety or shooting, 
but would never leave them at home with access to guns.
