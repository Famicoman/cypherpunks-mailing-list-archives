            Electronic Civil Defense for the 21st. Century
 The Convergence of the Commercial and the Military Sectors:
              Vulnerabilities, Capabilities and Solutions
                          September 5-6, 1996
                            Washington, DC

 Historically, civil defense has meant to protect citizenry against hostile
military actions. Today, with the specter of Information Warfare representing
new challenges to late-industrial and information age nation-states, the rules
have radically changed. Societies are rapidly migrating to increased dependance
upon four critical interrelated infrastructures and adequate methods of
protection must be developed:
 
 	- The Power grid is the basis of most of modern society. With it gone,
not much else happens.  If you think this is just a matter of building more
generators, think again--what happens if the factories that *make* the
generators are taken down, too? 
 
 	- The Communications infrastructure: land, sea, air and satellite. 95% 
of
military communications go over the public networks, and 100% of all financial
and industrial communications. Is it worth protecting?
 
 	- The Global Financial structure depends upon the first two
infrastructures, and is perhaps the most vulnerable to theft and denial of
service attack.  99+% of all "wealth" is digital--what happens if it vaporizes?
 
 	- Transportation systems rely upon the other three. The air traffic
systems require both power and communications to manage the thousands of
airplanes in the sky.  What happens to the thousands of airplanes in the air
if air traffic control across an entire country goes down?
 
 Without all of these infrastructures properly and reliably functioning, the
private sector and the national security community cannot function. No heat, no
air conditioning, no food distribution, no light, no radio or TV, no Internet.
Are we prepared?  Do we have a a crisis response for the day money as we  know
it vanishes?
 
 Electronic Civil Defense will soon become a critical component of any nation's
well being while the needs of both the private sector and government converge.
The convergence of military and civilian interests that Mr. Schwartau predicted
two years ago is happening before our eyes. Defensive and commercial postures
have so intertwined as to make them indistinguishable.
 
 This Fifth International Conference on Information Warfare is an unclassified,
open source forum, and will examine the myriad questions of Electronic Civil
Defense from the US, International and multi-cultural perspectives.
 
 Our seasoned experts will work with InfoWarCon5 delegates to outline a
framework for the vulnerabilities, threats, risks and solutions for Electronic
Civil Defense.  From this conference participants will be able to draw critical
insights which will improve their own legislative, regulatory, financial, and
operational readiness and security.  Last year's Washington InfoWarCon brought
together over 600 people and was covered by CNN among other major media
organizations. This year key world players in information warfare from the
economic, military, and law enforcement communities of over 30 countries are
expected to participate.    Be prepared for highly interactive sessions with
plenty of audience participation.  Please bring  your opinions and be ready to
discuss them with us all!

 				Col. Phil Johnson, Judge Avocate, USAF
 				Dr. Dan Kuehl, NDU
 
 	While CNN is looking over your shoulder, as a 
 	military commander, here is your choice: either use a precision 
 	smart bomb which will immediately kill 20 civilians for the world 
 	to see. Or, use a non-lethal IW weapon, no immediate TV deaths, 
 	but a predicted 200 civilian collateral fatalities within 30 days. 
 	What do you do? The Ethical conundra of Information Warfare will 
 	be examined from all perspectives.  Or: you have been attacked
	anonymously--you suspect one party, without proof--another
	attack is coming.  What now?  Should we develop new intelligence
	capabilities to permit precision detection and response in
	cyberwar?

 	D3	National Information Assurance: Cooperation is the Key
 		to Safeguarding Communications, Power and Transportation
 
 			Moderated by: Major Brad Bigelow, Office of the Manager, 
					National Communications System
				Jeff Sheldon, General Counsel,
					Utilities Telecommunications Council
				Steve Fabes, Director of Electronic Delivery 
Services,
					BankAmerica
				Carl Ripa, VP National Security/Emergency 
					Preparedness, Bellcore

 	Experts from the major civilian infrastructures will discuss how 
 	past cooperation between industry and government has echoed 
 	economic realities. The bulk of the nations information 
 	infrastructure is not under the economic or regulatory control of the 
 	Federal government. So, how do we maintain a healthy balance 
 	between private initiative and legislative and regulatory
 	actions? Today there is no "due diligence" standard which
	requires that communications and computing services be guaranteed
	in terms of security and data integrity.  Our panel will provoke
	an active discussion of remedial cooperative measures.

 	D4	"Understanding and Defending Against Industrial Espionage and 	
			Information Terrorism."
			Tom Fedorek, Managing Director, Kroll Associates New 
York*
			Matt DeVost TITLE COMING
			Charlies Swett, Acting Deputy Director for 
Low-Intenstity
			Conflict Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense 
			for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict 

 	A look at how modern espionage and information is conducted, why it's 
done and 
 	who's doing it.  How much can it cost your company and how can you 
 	tell if you're targeted? Do not miss this fascinating session
	which is expected to feature the Kroll Managing Directors
	from Paris, London, and New York.
 
 16:15 - 16:30	Break
 
 16:30 - 17:00		Wrap Up: "What is War?"
 			Moderated by Dr. Mich Kabay, NCSA
 				General Jim McCarthy, USAF (Ret)
 				John Petersen, President, The Arlington 
Institute
