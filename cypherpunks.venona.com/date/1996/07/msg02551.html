&gt;From &lt;<A  HREF="http://cnn.com/US/9607/28/clinton.speech/index.html">http://cnn.com/US/9607/28/clinton.speech/index.html</A>&gt;:

&gt;                            The president said he has invited congressional leaders to meet with the
&gt;                            head of the FBI on Monday. 
&gt;
&gt;                            The leaders will discuss bills that would expand wiretaps and allow for
&gt;                            chemically "tagging" explosives, which could help track terrorist acts.
&gt;                            Such legislation is needed to "increase the protection of the American
&gt;                            people," Clinton said. 
&gt;
&gt;                            Both measures were taken out of an anti-terrorism bill Clinton signed
&gt;                            into law earlier this year. He also said that a spate of recent acts of
&gt;                            political violence showed that law enforcement needed such powers. 
&gt;
&gt;                            "As strong as the bill was, it did not give our law enforcement officials
&gt;                            some of the powerful tools I had recommended," Clinton said. 

and from a similar article on AOL (from Reuters):

&gt;    ``We will ... do whatever is necessary to give law enforcement the tools they need to find 
&gt;terrorists before they strike and to bring them swiftly to justice when they do,'' he said. 
&gt;
[snip; same as the cnn story]
&gt;
&gt;    The expanded wiretap authority would allow law enforcement personnel to listen to all 
&gt;communications devices used by a given person, including a home phone, mobile phone and 
&gt;pager. At present, authority is given over a specific phone number, rather than for a 
&gt;specific person. 
&gt;
&gt;    The second measure would require explosives makers to insert a chemical fingerprint 
&gt;in their products that would help authorities narrow their search for a bomber. 

The White House web page does not have a transcript of the President's speech; in fact, under "Today's Top Issue" was 'President Clinton's Call for a National Community Policing Number', dated July 23rd.
