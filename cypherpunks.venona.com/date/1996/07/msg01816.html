[Cypherpunk relevance: Lemire's CD includes both US/Canadian and
international versions of PGP. I say ship the CD to third-world countries
with repressive racist regimes.]

I told the CBC what I thought of the Wiesenthal Center's misguided campaign,
and Lemire, yesterday. 

If you want to know more about Marc Lemire's controversial opinions, the CD
I bought from him recently arrived. The man's got quite an enemies' list,
with closeup GIFs of some big names. If you want a peek, remail me an
encrypted note and we'll work something out.

Connoisseurs of the genre will especially enjoy the commies, pictures\jews,
pictures\leftists, and pictures\traitors directories. I'd prefer to upload
the files to your server, since I don't currently have a spare box with
500MB disk that I can use for this.

People in the SF Bay Area are welcome to borrow the CD, all 528 MB of which
seems to be in the public domain. I've already copied all the files to local
disk. 

Anyone know a place in the South Bay where I could reproduce CDs, cheap? I
know I can beat his $30, but I'm not sure by how much.

Like hell I want to censor this stuff. There's a lot of money to be made
in racism if the price is right. Just ask Lyle Stuart.

Btw, Lemire's the guy who uploaded the Zundelsite files to the mirror sites. 
I include my original correspondence with him, and others -- I hadn't even
heard of any of these five people until I received email from them -- below. 
I have a lot of respect for Hilary and Thomas, who aren't liars.

Pholks interested in phreaking might be interested in Lemire's story at

Hi, Rich -

I just talked to Ernst, and he is very interested in your offer to mirror
his site unedited.  What is involved, technically?  Can you do it on your
own, without my involvement?  I am really, really a novice at the technical
side of it, and so is Ernst.  He said to "absolutely go ahead" if you could
do it and if you give him your word that the material would be unedited and
exactly as we are putting it up - and if you had a question, to please call
him at 416 - 922-9850.  It is his private line, and the man _never_ sleeps!

Please let me know since we don't know from day to day and even from hour
to hour what will happen, what with those massive censorship guns.

Are you a student at Stanford?

All best,

Ingrid

Hello Rich,

Thanks for your comments and encouragement in the Nizkor Guest Book.
Indeed you are quite correct: we most definitely agree with your
position that the best response is "meticulous documentation and
refutation, not censorship".

And I certainly hope that others will follow your example of indicating
a preference that people visit Nizkor - in fact, I find it quite sad
that the media will show the way to the denial/racist sites, but neglect
to point the way to Nizkor!

This letter is cc'd to Nizkor Project Director, Ken McVay and
Co-Webmaster, Jamie McCarthy.

____________________________

Your tireless work is greatly appreciated.

I was wondering if you had any comment on Deutsche Telekom's decision to
block access to webcom.com because of our "friend"
Zuendel, though. From a quick look around this site, it appears that
you'd be likely to agree with me that the best response is
meticulous documentation and refutation, not censorship.

To that end, I plan to mirror the "banned" site publicly, on as many
sites as I can muster, until Deutsche Telekom gives up. I will of
course point out that I'd much rather they visited your site.

Hello my name is Marc and I am writing you on behalf of Ernst Zundel.


I am wondering if this is the address (llurch@networking.stanford.edu) where
I can send the commpressed Web site documents to as a 'save attached'
message to?

And if you had an FTP site where I could instead of sending them to you,
could put them.

FTP is much easier and faster.


... PS.. The entire site is about ... 30-40 megabytes.  I can strip out all
the Sound files which would leave the site at only maybe 3 megs.



Talk to you soon. 




Thanks


Marc Lemire

I had the prosecutor's spokesman on phone today.  The result is
that someone gave a hint to the prosecutors which explicitly
mentioned Zundel, T-Online and Compuserve.  Consequently, the
prosecutors *had* to start investigations against Zundel,
T-Online and Compuserve.  In particular, they are right now
*checking* whether providing internet access is a criminal
offence due to the possibility to gain access to `inciting
material' (the German word is `Volksverhetzung') via the Net.

This means that it is not even clear whether the investigations
against internet providers will be dropped or not; in fact many
people believe that these investigatinos *will* be dropped.

My personal guess about all this is that some net.citizens are
trying to have the prosecutors engaged in absolutely absurd
investigations (or, even better, achieve a court room clash on
this subject) to get some clarification of the legal situation of
the Net in Germany.  Quite similar to the RSA T-Shirt story in
the States. ,-)

&gt;I'm firing up an FTP drop box on rosinante.stanford.edu right now... only
&gt;takes a minute.

OK where do I FTP to (exact address).  I tried to ftp to the address above
and it said connection failed.

Do I try to go to Stanford.edu first then to somewhere??

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks

&gt; Someone please inform Deutsche Telekom and the relevant prosecutors that
&gt; by the time they read this (i.e., within an hour), selected files from
&gt; Zundel's holocaust-denial archives (which make me sick, but that's beside
&gt; the point) will be available at the AFS path:
&gt;
&gt;  /afs/ir.stanford.edu/users/l/llurch/WWW/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/

Rich, I'm going to mirror your site at:

file:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/declan/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/

I've just copied everything over, and now I'm creating an index page.
Almost everything, that is. I only have a few megs to spare on this
project; I'm already hosting the damn banned French book.
