	let me phrase it another way: there are circumstances where the lives 
    of 'n' innocent people are of less consequence than the enemy --in other 
    words, try to keep collateral damage to a minimum, but get the target 
    before he executes more harm (this applies to hostage situations, as well)

	in general, this does not mean wipe out an entire 100 story building to 
    find a single sniper, but sometimes a commander is faced with the choice: 
    send a team in with a 10% chance of accomplishing the mission (i.e. the 
    team is killed or the target escapes) or waste the village.

	until you have experience the death of men in combat, you will never 
    understand this principle. I certainly did not, and even as a graduate of 
    Harvard and an active member of the LDS Church, I found it only takes once 
    to _clearly_ understand that it is 'to kill or be killed.'

	don't sit in your ivory tower and pontificate until you walk the mile 
    in my shoes.  I also had the responsibility for as many as 1600 additional
    'black shirts' in a fire zone  --think about it.

	oh, sure, I (or anyone else) will never convince you --but maybe you 
    will think about it.

	war is hell, son; and war zones are somewhere beyond.  if you go, just 
    pray that you come back understanding that and not with scrambled eggs for 
    brains.
