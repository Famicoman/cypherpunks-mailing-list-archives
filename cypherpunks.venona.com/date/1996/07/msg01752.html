&gt; &gt; &gt; if I ever found him with a gun.
&gt; &gt;      Yes, those guns are evil things. Evil I tell you, constantly shooting
&gt; &gt; people for no reason, going off half-cocked and whooping it up all by 
&gt; &gt; their polished oiled ol selves.
&gt; Hmm.  Sarcasm?  Cannot definitively say, but I'll guess it is.

     Only a little bit.

&gt; &gt;      Isn't it funny how otherwise rational people can ascribe intentions
&gt; &gt; and moral alignement (ie. good/evil) to an inert chunk of steel?
&gt; Assuming you are accusing me of such, you should probably point out
&gt; specifically where I said such a thing.  (If I did, it would be bad
&gt; grammar or some such, and I would certainly retract it.)

      Not accusing you specifically, only really mentioning it in passing.
If I was accusing you of it, I would have said so. 

&gt; &gt;      He also taught me the basics of gun saftey, and made sure that
&gt; &gt; I took those classes that were available to me in the areas of gun 
&gt; &gt; saftey and marksmanship.
&gt; You might be missing the mark too, but I thought the subject was
&gt; giving a gun to every child who enters school, not YOURs or SOME
&gt; EXPERT 6 YEAR OLD's special case.

     I was no expert, and I am (IMO) still a lousy marksman. I just don't
have the money to practice _at all_ so I don't keep my guns here in Chicago.

&gt; Yes, if every child was truly an exemplary God-fearing Christian,
&gt; I would probably have fewer objections to giving every child a
&gt; gun.  After all, they would NEVER use it in a fit of rage or
&gt; jealousy or any such sins ...  Right?

     Hmmm... Sarcasm? I _really_ can't tell. 

&gt; Death is permanent.  A child is prone to accidents.  Maybe those
&gt; of you who are just too "special" and "talented" don't need such
&gt; paternalistic frameworks, but I know my child cannot tell right
&gt; from wrong, good from bad.  He will get better over time.  But I

     Are you telling me that I give your kid more credit than you? There 
is a difference between knowing and caring. 

&gt; don't want another child to pay for my son's less than full
&gt; maturity by getting shot.

    There is a difference between teaching a 6 year old proper gun saftey and 
letting the kid carry. 

     If it was you, you said that you were going to let your kid have a gun 
until he was old enough te get it himself. How do you expect him/her to 
know how to use it if you don't teach them? Would you give a kid the keys 
to a car at 16 if they have never been taught how to drive?
