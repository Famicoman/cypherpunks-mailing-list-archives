&gt;I think Tim May is growing senile...

This is new? &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt; (Later examples were to be even worse. For example, the burglar who climbed
&gt;&gt; on a roof and stepped through a skylight. He sued, and won. I guess the
&gt;&gt; owner of the property was obligated to install night lights so burglars
&gt;&gt; could see their way, and to generally make his property more
&gt;&gt; "burglar-friendly."
&gt;
&gt;Actually, he fell through the roof of a school he was trying to burgalize.
&gt;
&gt;In a similar incident a burglar broke into a house that was being treated
&gt;for pests (i.e., was full of toxic fumes). He died; his family sued the
&gt;owners and won.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe someone can post a reference to these two cases. I recall that both
&gt;happened in New York, but I could be wrong.

I remember hearing about a case on this end of the continent (west coast)
that involved  a store that had been robbed many times. The owner noticed
that most burglars came through the skylight, so he electrified it. Not
much of a charge, just something like 12 volts - enough to keep someones
hands off of it...  However, a klutzy burglar managed to fall into the
skylight and get stuck.  His partner deserted him.  Over the course of
several hours, he died... *ouch*  Needless to say, his next-of-kin sued
and won. The guy lost his store.


Another one I liked: in (I believe) Pennsylvania, a drunk peed on an
electrified third rail.  His next of kin sued the trolley company and
won...

A man tried to commit suicide in Chicago by jumping onto an El track.  He
was only crippled, so he sued and won!
