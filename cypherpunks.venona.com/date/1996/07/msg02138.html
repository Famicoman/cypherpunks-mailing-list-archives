&gt; &gt;&gt; I would have suggested even being as nice as "We'll do the same as MIT
&gt; &gt;&gt; does with PGP's distrobution, or RSA does with RSAREF (just so you'll
&gt; &gt;&gt; know, RSA's FTP basicly has a readme file that says "the files in
&gt; &gt;&gt; subdir of a dir thats -r+x to you, so if you're a citizen go to
&gt; &gt;&gt; dist/usaRANDOM_NUMBER_HERE", thats it).  Then make them explain why
&gt; &gt;&gt; Netscape should be any different.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MIT reportedly has a letter stating that their systems is okay.  The
&gt; &gt;state department wouldn't give us such a letter because they were
&gt; &gt;"currently reevaluating their guidelines", or some such thing.  We
&gt; &gt;convinced them to give us temporary permission for this system until
&gt; &gt;they had finalized their new policy.
&gt; 
&gt; That still doesn't make since.
&gt; 
&gt; First, there were laws.  And we had to obey them.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, they added ITAR.  And they want us to obey it.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, it seems, they're giving us "guidelines."  Not law, Not ITAR.
&gt; 
&gt; Next it's gonna be their their fondest desires, their preferences,and
&gt; finally their whims.
&gt; 
&gt; What's wrong with this picture?    Do I detect an ass-kissing contest?

  If we chose to "kiss ass", we would not be distributing software
that does strong encryption over the internet.  We would not be
selling millions of copies in thousands of retail outlets across the
country.  We would be doing what some other companies have been
doing for years, which is only produce export grade crypto, even
for US customers.

  The simple fact is that our executives decided not to provide
our US software for download over the internet until we got
a written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controls
that we would not be prosecuted for such actions.  This decision
was made by our executives based on advice given them by lawyers
that they trust.  The requirements imposed by the government
were to get this written statement.
