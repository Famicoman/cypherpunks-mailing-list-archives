&gt;
&gt;While I'm not exactly sure what you mean by a "commercially-available,
&gt;public encryption system," I think your point is incorrect.

I didn't mean that I think that the govt should be allowed to control.  I
meant that govt would only be able to regulate commercial and/or public
systems.  They, of course, would have no say in the specs of my
personally-written cryptosystem.

&gt;(My confusion is that a commercially-available system is not necessarily a
&gt;"public" system, if by public one means public domain. If one means
&gt;"published specifications," still not the case. Confusing.)

Sorry about the confusion.  Although I may have used the two terms loosely,
I was trying to contrast commercial and public against something written in
secret and not offered for govt approval.

&gt;Howver, the government cannot step in and "control" a
&gt;commercially-available product, by even the most liberal interpretations of
&gt;the commerce clause. "Tim's Pretty Flaky Snakeoil System," for example. I
&gt;can announce it, sell it, and the government is powerless to "control" it.
&gt;(Even if it were "public.")
&gt;
&gt;If by "public" you mean an NBS or NIST standard, like DES, then I suppose
&gt;the government can in some sense "control" it. (Even this is iffy, IMO, as
&gt;I know of no rules saying DES implementations must be approved by NIST or
&gt;anyone else.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;anyone from designing their own cryptosystem for personal use?  If the
&gt;&gt;government intercepted a transmission from this private cryptosystem, and
&gt;&gt;could not decrypt it, would they assume that it must be considered
&gt;&gt;munitions?  Similarly, anyone could send uniformly-formatted random garble
&gt;&gt;that could also be considered munitions, or at least waste the governments
&gt;&gt;processing time.
&gt;
&gt;Most of the cryptosystems are not under the "control" of the government,
&gt;even by the standards of your first definition. Period. RSA is not a
&gt;government-controlled system, though it is both "commercially-available"
&gt;AND "public" (in that the spec and algorithm are clearly published).
&gt;
&gt;And the talk about "personal use" is misleading, IMO. It suggests that
&gt;government can and should regulate use for "business purposes" but not
&gt;personal uses. I disagree with this distinction.

Absolutely not!  Let me clarify that I feel that the govt should have no
part in crypto regulation, be it commercial, public, private, business, etc.

&gt;&gt;     Why are we so worried about government regulation?  Can't we just
&gt;&gt;devise our own cryptosystems and just don't sell them or make them publicly
&gt;&gt;available?
&gt;
&gt;You mean the way public key systems in general and  RSA in particular were
&gt;invented and devised by non-government folks?

After some responses and some thought, I have seen the error in my thinking.
Having a secret, proprietary cryptosystem would loose the public-key benefit.
It would be fine, I believe, for point-to-point communications though.
