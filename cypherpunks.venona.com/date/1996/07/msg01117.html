Subject: Gorelick testifies before Senate, unveils new executive order

Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified yesterday before Sen.
Sam Nunn's cyberscare hearing (take #3), where she ranted about the
evils of the Net and unveiled an executive order signed by the
president on Monday.

Gorelick, the administration's newly-annointed chief Net fearmonger,
said: "The executive order is on Federal Information Infrastructure
protection... It creates a committee to draft policy and recommend
legislation. The order cites two types of threats: physical and cyber."

The infrastructure she's talking about isn't government computers; she
means the private sector. "Because this infrastructure is privately
owned, this [executive order] emphasizes and recognizes the importance
of cooperation."

That is, cooperation with the fear of government regulation hanging
over your head. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection, which will have an industry advisory panel, has one year to
report back with recommendations.

Sen. Patrick Leahy testified: "Armed with a modem and a computer, a
criminal can wreak havoc on our computers from anywhere in the world.
There are no borders in cyberspace... Existing criminal statutes
provide a good framework for prosecuting [some] computer offenses... We
have to assume we have to update our criminal code."

Clinton's executive order also creates a "Infrastructure Protection
Task Force," effective immediately, with reps from the FBI, DOD, and
NSA. At yesterday's Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations
hearing, Gorelick ducked Sen. Nunn's questions about the limits of the
task force's authority. But the executive order says the group must:

      (i)     provide, or facilitate and coordinate the provision of,
              expert guidance to critical infrastructures to detect,
              revent, halt, or confine an attack and to recover and restore
              service...
      (v)     coordinate with the pertinent law enforcement authorities
              during or after an attack to facilitate any resulting
              criminal investigation.

"Critical infrastructures" include telecommunications facilities and
the Net.

Critical infrastructures:

 1. telecommunications;
 2. electrical power systems;
 3. gas and oil storage and transportation;
 4. banking and finance;
 5. transportation;
 6. water supply systems;
 7. emergency services (including medical, police, fire and rescue); and
 8. continuity of government.




                          EXECUTIVE ORDER

                           - - - - - - -

                 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION

      Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity
 or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic
 security of the United States.  These critical infrastructures include
 telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas and oil storage and
 transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems,
 emergency services (including medical, police, fire and rescue), and
 continuity of government.  Threats to these critical infrastructures fall
 into two categories: physical threats to tangible property ("physical
 threats"), and threats of electronic, radio-frequency, or computer-based
 attacks on the information or communications components that control
 critical infrastructures ("cyber threats").  Because many of these
 critical infrastructures are owned and operated by the private sector, it
 is essential that the government and private sector work together to
 develop a strategy for protecting them and assuring their continued
 operation.

      NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
 Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby
 ordered as follows:

      Section 1.  Establishment.  There is hereby established the
 President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection
 ("Commission").
      (a) Chair.  A qualified individual from outside the Federal
 Government shall be appointed by the President to serve as Chair of the
 Commission.  The Commission Chair shall be employed on a full-time basis.
      (b) Members.  The head of each of the following executive branch
 departments and agencies shall nominate not more than two full-time
 members of the Commission:

      (ix)    Federal Bureau of Investigation;
      (x)     National Security Agency.
      One of the nominees of each agency may be an individual from outside
 the Federal Government who shall be employed by the agency on a full-time
 basis.  Each nominee must be approved by the Steering Committee.

      Sec. 2.  The Principals Committee.  The Commission shall report to
 the President through a Principals Committee ("Principals Committee"),

 shall advise the Commission on the subjects of the Commission's mission in
 whatever manner the Advisory Committee, the Commission Chair, and the
 Steering Committee deem appropriate.
      (b) A Chair shall be designated by the President from among the
 members of the Advisory Committee.
      (c) The Advisory Committee shall be established in compliance with
 the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.).  The

      Sec. 7.  Interim Coordinating Mission.  (a) While the Commission is
 conducting its analysis and until the President has an opportunity to
 consider and act on its recommendations, there is a need to increase
 coordination of existing infrastructure protection efforts in order to
 better address, and prevent, crises that would have a debilitating
 regional or national impact.  There is hereby established an
 Infrastructure Protection Task Force ("IPTF") within the Department of
 Justice, chaired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to undertake this
 interim coordinating mission.
      (b) The IPTF will not supplant any existing programs or
 organizations.
      (c) The Steering Committee shall oversee the work of the IPTF.

 other executive branch departments and agencies.  Members shall be
 designated by their departments or agencies on the basis of their
 expertise in the protection of critical infrastructures.  IPTF members'
 compensation shall be paid by their parent agency or department.
      (e) The IPTF's function is to identify and coordinate existing
 expertise, inside and outside of the Federal Government, to:
      (i)     provide, or facilitate and coordinate the provision of,
              expert guidance to critical infrastructures to detect,
              revent, halt, or confine an attack and to recover and restore
              service;
