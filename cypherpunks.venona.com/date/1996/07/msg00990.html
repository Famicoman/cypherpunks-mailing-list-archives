To clarify my earlier post :
Up until anbout 29 May, 1996, the Cybank site
had a "test" file that was placed as a challenge.
As there was a challenge, I took it.
The following describes the data I was able to 
recover from the test file.

I have received a number of files asking
how I had hacked the Cybank server. I have acheived
no such feat, merely determining the
methodology used at the Cybank site.
I communicated that fact to Cybank's operators,
who subsequently seemto have altered their
site, and download client.

Taking this issue any further has no interest
to me, and I am unable to post any
VB source code - I "cleaned" some hard 
disk space, and have deleted the working files
I used at the time. Silly me.

Also, the Cybank site seems to have changed, so I don't
know how you would get a test fle without becoming a 
Cybank user, which would probably mean passing your name,
credit card etc to them.

At the time, Cybank seemed very happy with actual user testing,
however, I have had little further contact (1-2 emails).

ps - i have also learned some interesting spelling 
methods as a result of informative emails.

&gt; &gt;According to me, this decodes to :

&gt; &gt;!O1! 12!O2   = I don't understand these bits yet
&gt; &gt;!I1!                 = a common delimiter  - 1 = start
&gt; &gt;830304962394 = serial number that this 10 cents is for/from
&gt; &gt;!I2!                 = a common delimiter  - 2 = end
&gt; &gt;A1!0.10!A2!  = ammount is 10 cents, $0.10
&gt; &gt;P1!!P2!              = seems to be a token of some kind
&gt; &gt;C1!0.10!C2   = a check value to ensure amount is correct.

well done Lyal!

not bad so far but you've missed a few things  :-)

presume that you've used a VB3.0 decompiler to do it

but we're upgrading to VB4.0 and changing the encryption process

very soon :-)

where are you?

your prize might well be a job!!!!!!

:-)

plus the whole cash environment is becoming server-based
within a couple of weeks.

stay in touch, we need a beta-tester!
