(1) FBI Director to Testify at Senate Crypto Hearing; Netizens can 
    Participate in Hearing Live Online, Submit Testimony for the Record

On Thursday July 25 the Full Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing
to consider S. 1726, the 'Pro-CODE' bill designed to relax export controls
on encryption.  FBI Director Louis Freeh and other high-ranking
Administration officials are scheduled to testify. A second panel of
computer industry leaders, including Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and others,
will also give testimony for the committee.

In an effort to ensure that concerned Internet users can participate in
this important policy debate, the Senate Commerce Committee has arranged
with CDT, VTW, HotWired, and DIGEX to bring the hearing live online.
Netizens will also be able to submit testimony for the record.  Details on
the cybercast can be found below, or by visiting:

      <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/">http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/</A>

This full committee hearing represents another important step forward
towards passage of legislation designed to make encryption more widely
available to computer users.

Sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Senate 
Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-SD), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and 
others, the Pro-CODE bill is designed to encourage the widespread 
availability of strong privacy and security technologies for the Internet.
The bill was the subject of two hearings held on June 12 and June 26 before
the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Space, and Technology.  The 
June 26th hearing was the first Congressional hearing ever to be cybercast
live on the Internet. (Details about that cybercast can be found at 
<A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/events/062696/">http://www.crypto.com/events/062696/</A>).

testify at the July 25th hearing, background on the Pro-CODE bill, and

opportunity for Netizens to participate in the democratic process and to
encourage communication between Members of Congress and the Internet
Community on critical Internet policy issues:

      Commerce Committee Staff and a representative of CDT will participate 
      in an interactive "chat room" from inside the hearing room. Anyone 
      with a telnet application can join the chat room, ask questions of 
      the Senate staff, and discuss the issues with fellow Netizens. 
      Participants will also have an opportunity to provide questions to 
      the Committee Chairman to ask of the Witnesses.

    * Still Video Images: Video images from inside the hearing room will be
      uploaded to <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/">http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/</A> throughout the
