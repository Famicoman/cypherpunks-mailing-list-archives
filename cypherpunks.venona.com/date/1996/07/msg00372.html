In preparing the next version of cryptlib (which is going to have some cool
features when it's ready, which should be before the end of the millenium),
I've run into a problem in writing a general-purpose n-byte input to m-byte
output transformation function.  What this does is take an arbitrary-length
user key and transform it to a fixed-length encryption key (for example an
entered passphrase into a 112-bit triple-DES key).  The constraints on memory
usage are:
 
- The input (user) key can't be altered (you can't change data passed in by the
  caller)
- The user key can't be copied to an internal buffer (it can be of arbitrary
  length, and is sensitive material so shouldn't be copied elsewhere)
 
In other words there's no temporary storage available apart from what's
provided in the output key.  This is almost always a different length from the
input key.
 
Some other constraints are:
 
- The transformation must be algorithm-independant (it shouldn't, for example,
  rely on SHA1 to transform an input string into a fixed output of 160 bits and
  assume you'll never need a key longer than 160 bits).
 
This means you can't just use a single pass of a hash function to generate the
output key, since the output can be smaller or larger than the hash function
output.
 
- The transformation must be able to be iterated to make a password-guessing
  attack harder to perform.
 
This one is tricky, since the lack of temporary buffer space means you can't
just feed the output back to the input and iterate.
 
Here's my initial approach, if anyone has any comments to make on this or knows
of a better way to do it, please let me know.
 
Peter.
 
-- Snip --
 
Initially, the user key is passed in as a byte string:
 
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    |                      User Key                         |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
 
The first stage in the key hashing prepends the length of the string as a
big-endian 16-bit count to the user key:
 
    +------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    |Length|                      User Key                         |
    +------+-------------------------------------------------------+
 
The aim of the hashing is to reduce this variable-length input string to a
fixed-length key appropriate to the encryption algorithm being used.  This is
done by treating the user encryption keys as circular buffers and repeatedly
hashing chunks of the user key and xoring the result into the output buffer.
Thus the first chunk of the encryption key would be obtained with:
 
    +------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    |Length|                      User Key                         |
    +------+-------------------------------------------------------+
     |                            |
     |                       _  /
     |  Hash           _  /
     |           _  /
     |        /
     |      |
    +-----------------------+
    |     Encryption Key    |
    +-----------------------+
 
The second chunk of the enryption key would be obtained with:
 
    +------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    |Length|                      User Key                         |
    +------+-------------------------------------------------------+
             |                            |
             |                       _  /
             |  Hash           _  /
             |           _  /
             |        /
             |      |
    +-----------------------+
    |     Encryption Key    |
    +-----------------------+
 
Since the input to the hash function is much larger than its output, a
significant amount of the user key affects each chunk of the encryption key.
The size of each "chunk" is determined by the hash function being used.  For
example with the MD4 hash function, 64 bytes of user key affect each 16 bytes
of encryption key.
 
Once the end of the user key or encryption key buffer is reached, the hash
function wraps around to the start of the buffer and takes its data from there.
A pass over the user key is considered complete when the hash function input
has wrapped around completely and is back at the start of the buffer.
 
The amount of wraparound depends on the length of the user and encryption keys.
For example with 8-byte (strictly speaking 56-bit) DES keys even a single
application of MD4 will wrap around the encryption key buffer twice, shrinking
up to 64 bytes down to 8 bytes in a single operation.  On the other hand a
4-byte user key will wrap the user key buffer around twice, expanding it to
fill 8 bytes of the encryption key buffer (without, however, actually giving 8
bytes of effective key space).
 
In order to avoid repeatedly hashing the same data (which results in the output
key cancelling out every second round), the input data is varied by adding the
iteration count mod 256 to each byte before it is hashed.  Therefore for five
rounds of key hashing the user key "This is a key" would give the following
effective input to the hash function:
 
  \x00\x0DThis is a user key
  \x01\x0EUijt!jt!b!vtfs!lfz
  \x02\x0FVjku"ku"c"wugt"mg{
  \x03\x10Wklv#lv#d#xvhu#nh|
  \x04\x11Xlmw$mw$e$ywiv$oi}
 
[Is this nice?  Problems are that you might be able to perform some sort of
 related-key attack, and that if you know the input value to round n you can
 get the input value to round n+m without having to go through all m rounds.
 However I can't see how this would aid an attacker].
