&gt;Like a lot of pop-psychopharmacology, "syndromes" frequently get defined by
&gt;whether the right drug has the desired effect. If prozac works, you're
&gt;depressed, if Ritalin does, you're an ADDer, and so on. By Tim's anecdotal
&gt;evidence, the little hellion (hey, *I* was one...) must be ADD because
&gt;Ritalin works.

Probably so, and I think I recall my friend mentioning that this was the
kid needed the dose. Whether it's an upper or a downer or whatever is
immaterial: it acts as a downer for this kid. A zombie drug, at least on
this kid. (And I gather that this is the main effect on the many California
schoolchildren who are getting their school-administered doses of mind
control drugs.)

&gt;You can actually see ADD with a PET scan, but the proper way to get a
&gt;diagnosis of ADD is to get tested for it, which, in the case of ADD, is an
&gt;expensive man-day or two with with some clinical shrink in your face, and a
&gt;bunch of frustrating (if you're ADD) tests of your attention and ability to
&gt;focus in the presence of a lot of distractions. Oddly enough, *another*
&gt;pop-psychologist from Harvard was on "20/20" this week talking about
&gt;"emotional" intellegence, and one of the determinants was inability to
&gt;understand delayed gratification. Like most kids with ADD, I must have been
&gt;a drooling idiot, in that case.

&gt;From what I've read--and I'm no expert, having long had essentially the
_opposite_ of "attention deficit disorder," assuming it really even
exists!--most children getting Ritalin are just being sedated. Behavior
control in its purest form. While the kids stop their wandering attention
and constant physical motions, it's because they're in a mental fog, just
one step away from drooling. (The 8-year-old friend of my friend's son is
so zoned out he can't play video games well at all...until the drugs wear
off.)

&gt;However, I practically agree with Tim on all of his screed. (A good one, I
&gt;might add. He probably only reread it once for punctuation and spelling
&gt;before he did a command-e to send it on its way. After wiping the foam
&gt;from his mouth, that is. ;-)) It seems to me that the very *last* person to

Au contraire, I almost _never_ rework my posts. They are sent out as I
write them, just as conversation is not reworked and edited. For an
informal list, the conversational mode works best for me. (I get a kick out
of John Young's obscure stuff, but if he _talks_ this way, whoah!)

&gt;BarelyObCrypto: ADD is more about lack of attention *control* than lack of
&gt;attention itself. Hyperfocus is also a trait of ADHD, and computers tend to
&gt;cause hyperfocus for a lot of ADDers. How many easily distracted knee-jiggling
&gt;wunderkind hackers do *you* know? Care to guess how many ADDers there are
&gt;on cypherpunks?

BTW, I saw a comment that Bill Gates is almost certainly an ADD person...or
maybe the comment was that he is borderline autistic? (I think it was the
latter, based on his focus on things, his physical mannerisms, etc. Perhaps
growing up in rainy Seattle made him a kind of "rain man.")
