&gt; 
&gt; Honourable wishes,
&gt; 
&gt;  I write about Mrs. Clinton's concept of Global Village and wholeheartedly,
&gt; pledge my support to such an important concept.
&gt;  
&gt;  The world is everchanging and Mrs. Clinton is correct in that the
&gt; industrialized
&gt; countries have lost, most, of their extended families. This makes children
&gt; vulnerable to danger. If in need of help, such children are commonly abused
&gt; due to their vulnerability.
&gt; 
&gt;  I want to take this moment to express some understandings. Firstly, it
&gt; was never in my plan to locate where I have been over the last while.
&gt; Probably, if it hadn't been for many malicious encounters, I probably
&gt; would of gone to a remote island, as I hold so dear to my heart. A
&gt; close friend was severly violated and I had to witness a war being
&gt; fought against civillians. When an insurance policy becomes more
&gt; valuable than the human life, something must be wrong with social
&gt; ethics.
&gt; 
&gt;  To live through many of the experiences I had to, while living here,
&gt; made me realize high technology is dangerous in many peoples
&gt; lives. To manipulate peoples decisions using brute force seemed
&gt; terribly wrong to me. Many of the people controlling the situations
&gt; are also stressed out. Abuse results from stress.
&gt; 
&gt;   Concerning the old man. I knew of this man since childhood. I
&gt; always considered him one of the greatest neuroscientists
&gt; on the planet earth. Even his friends hold him with  a greatest
&gt; respect. What he accomplished, very few could  match his
&gt; accomplishments.
&gt; 
&gt;   I send much thanks to Point Communications for allowing me
&gt; a long interview about my social concerns. I wanted to personally
&gt; thank all the K12 students that partook in my interview. I was
&gt; never able to attend the requests of some of those students,
&gt; that asked me to review some of their essays, as my time
&gt; was occupied with endless other obstacles. I want those
&gt; students to understand that I just couldn't.
&gt; 
&gt;   I want to thank all those cool students that let me participate
&gt; at their, private, dance parties. They know I attended endless
&gt; dance parties, researching technological requirements,
&gt; so they are happy and socially satisfied. I also got to
&gt; know what kind of social threats they are faced with, both,
&gt; underground and official. Stress does tend to corrupt some 
&gt; people.
&gt; 
&gt;   I want you to understand that I came up with Molecule One
&gt; as a means to address the needs of a culture. Even though
&gt; many plots were directed at me for proposing this project,
&gt; I always knew I spoke the truth and my intentions were
&gt; pure. Neurosciences has always been a lifelong inspiration
&gt; to me. Standards, to improve the quality of life in society,
&gt; seemed a noble goal.
&gt; 
&gt;  I want the students to know that Molecule One was 
&gt; created for their benefit first. They are the future. When
&gt; a child remains innocent, that innocence should be
&gt; protected. Far too often, children loose their innocence
&gt; to hardend people, who's primary motive is malicious
&gt; intent. Naivete and innocence is purity and lack of
&gt; ethical standard is rampent.
&gt; 
&gt;  I knew that acceptance of truth is difficult for
&gt; some people, especially those ignorant and those
&gt; conditioned to believe otherwise. I always chose
&gt; positive as an outcome for motive.
&gt; 
&gt;  I want to thank all of you, Republican, Democrat,
&gt; and families, friends and which other political
&gt; inspiration. I respect all life and those standards that
&gt; can increase the health standard of all people. There
&gt; are many important factors that must be considered
&gt; to insure a safe and healthy society, of the
&gt; future. To work together, to attain this standard,
&gt; is important for all people, irregardless of color.
&gt; Care and courtesy, toward our fellow people,
&gt; is another  social characteristic that is becoming
&gt; lost, with the loss of the extended family.
&gt; 
&gt;  I also want to thank all those cool computer folk
&gt; that let me play upon the info  highway, as it was
&gt; being developed. I want to thank all those
&gt; cyberfolk that recognised the import of all
&gt; topics covered. Understand well, visions of
&gt; tropical islands have floated through my mind,
&gt; probably, everyday I've been here. It  was
&gt; my concern for the youth and for the elderly
&gt; that made me stay and attempt to create
&gt; a project that could bring happiness and
&gt; harmony, to the society, for a long time to
&gt; come. It is a challenge.
&gt; 
&gt;   Thanks for the cyber inspiration, acknowledgement
&gt; and being allowed the opportunity to create a 
&gt; work of art that can benefit so many.
&gt; 
&gt;   To the 1'st family &amp; 2  Mr.&amp; Mrs. Dole, all friends and families.
&gt; 
&gt;   Peace and best wishes,
&gt;                           Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt;                                   Asim
