why not put together (a LOT of) disk space and we can build a table
(read: "a cryptanalytic time-memory tradeoff") for cracking DES? Using
the table, we could brute-search the DES keyspace in less time than it
would take to do an exhaustive search of a 38 bit keyspace, according to
the paper. 4 gigs is what, a couple of hundred nowadays?

Making DES equivalent to a 40-bit crack would take approx. 500Gig, but
publishing the table would push DES out usefulness. Certainly we could
scale back (make DES equivalent to a 45-bit crack?) if we don't have
enough disk...

&gt;&gt; I volunteer my 120 MHZ Pentium.  A lot more Pentiums are out there now than

&gt;&gt; flat rate local phone connection so could run a cracking session
&gt;&gt;permanently
&gt;&gt; (as long as no one tells my ISP).  We need a full test of the Winsock

&gt;&lt;back-of-envelope&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In my terminology, 'hairy edge of doability" means we have a shot
&gt;at success, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.
&gt;
&gt;I thought that I might bet a couple hundred bucks, though.
&gt;
&gt;Sadly, after further calculation, I'm not so sure if it's doable just yet.
&gt;
&gt;What I'm looking at is a known plaintext attack on single ECB DES, 
&gt;using a brute-force test to cycle through the key space. People 
&gt;would get chunks of keyspace to test from a central server or 
&gt;servers, and would be motivated to take part by a cash prize for
&gt;the lucky person who finds the key.
&gt;
&gt;Lets do  the numbers:
&gt;
&gt;Single DES has the security of 56 bits of key - there are 64 bits in the
&gt;keys, but 8 of them are parity bits which add nothing to security.
&gt;
&gt;2^56  = 7.205e16 keys (which is a whopping big number)
&gt;
&gt;Let's guess that we can recruit the equivalent of full-time on 1000
&gt;machines.
&gt;
&gt;7.205e13 keys/machine.
&gt;
&gt;Let's guess that we have about a month before people start to lose 
&gt;interest - so we want to be more than 1/2 done by then. Lets say
&gt;we want to sweep the whole space in 40 days.
&gt;
&gt;1.8e12 keys/machine/day 
&gt;
&gt;~21,000,000 keys/machine/second
&gt;
&gt;The fastest general purpose, freely available des implementation I'm
&gt;aware of is libdes. by Eric Young. With this, I can do a set_key in 
&gt;15.8 us, and an ecb_encrypt in 95 us/block. That adds up to 
&gt;about 9,000 keytests/sec (this is on a 90 MHz P5, running NT).
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking at ideas to speed up DES - if I'm willing to use
&gt;honking great lookup tables, the permutation steps  can be done 
&gt;more quickly than libdes. I'm also looking at implementing the
&gt;algolrithm in hand-optimized P5 assembler.  (It's been years since
&gt;I've done a major assembler project - the P5 has some truely weird
&gt;features to be considered, but also has (some) internal 64 bit
&gt;registers to play with).
&gt;
&gt;Let's guess that I can speed up a key-test up by a factor of 10. (This is
&gt;not a slur on Eric's code - it's extremely clever, but not optimized
&gt;for any particular processor, or for key-testing.  Note that the keytest 
&gt;described above takes about 10,000 cycles/test.)
&gt;
&gt;That gets my workstation up to about 90,000 keys a second, which is
&gt;still almost a factor of 250 too slow. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm going ahead with my work on a faster DES keytester, but unless
&gt;optimizing gives an astounding win, I now think a distributed bruting 
&gt;effort is a bit pre-mature.
&gt;
&gt;What will make this brute doable, if not now, then in the near future?
&gt;
&gt;1. Faster Processors - Moore's Law is still holding. A year ago, my
&gt;90 MHz Pentium was one of the faster machines taking part in the
&gt;40-bit RC4 crack. Now, it's passe.
&gt;
&gt;2. More processors. The number of people on the internet continues
&gt;to grow rapidly.
&gt;
&gt;3. More interest - Crypto awareness has greatly increased in the
&gt;last year, and a real cash prize (say, over $500) will generate both
&gt;publicity and interest.
&gt;
&gt;These factors all multiply together. The number of cycles that could
&gt;probably be recruited is increasing at a fast rate. A major part of the
&gt;work will be a keyspace distribution mechanism which can handle
&gt;the load (this was a major stumbling block last year). 
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/back-of-envelope&gt;
