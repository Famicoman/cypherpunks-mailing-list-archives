&gt;Hi all
&gt;
&gt;I can just see the FBI screaming "we need weaker encryption to combat
&gt;terrosism on US soil" with nasty effects -- it seems all to many people,
&gt;lawmakers included, will be only to happy to sacrifice their privacy that
&gt;the FBI can better combat these terrorist acts (which could *of course*
&gt;could been prevented had only the FBI been able to read their encrypted
&gt;mail...)
&gt;
&gt;Somehow I got the feeling watching CNN that the FBI was given a shitload
&gt;of ammo. Call me cynical but the Reichstag fire comes to mind...

This was on another list.  It expresses my sentiments quite well.

&gt;TWA 800 AND THE POLICE STATE OF GEORGIA
&gt;
&gt;By L. Neil Smith &lt;lneil@ezlink.com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Special to _The Libertarian Enterprise_
&gt;
&gt;    I've been sitting around all week, watching the Olympics whether I 
&gt;like it or not, because my wife and daughter want to watch them, and I 
&gt;can deny them nothing.  
&gt;
&gt;    In between undeniably dramatic moments -- astonishingly courageous 
&gt;little girls "playing hurt", as if they were major-league football 
&gt;players -- I've been treated to story after story of how, due to the 
&gt;efforts of thousands of uniformed professional paranoids, Georgia, USA 
&gt;is coming to resemble _Soviet_ Georgia.  The sight of _hundreds_ of 
&gt;trailers moved in to house these security "troops" is demoralizing in 
&gt;and of itself to anyone with a regard for a free society.  
&gt;
&gt;    At the same time, I've been a TV witness to the tragedy of TWA 
&gt;Flight 800 and an ignoble struggle by network fear-vampires to wring 
&gt;the story of its last delectable drop -- "It was a bomb!"  "It was a 
&gt;missile!"  "It was a bomb!" "It was a missile!" -- the whole thing 
&gt;beginning to sound like a macabre Certs commercial.  
&gt;
&gt;    Over it all hung the spectre of international terrorism, and the 
&gt;swollen, corrupt, bulbous-nosed, droopy-jowled visage of a politician 
&gt;(no "New Democrat" as it turns out, but just another damned fascist) 
&gt;grimly determined -- exactly like Richard Milhous "Guns are an 
&gt;Abomination" Nixon before him -- to be the last democratically elected 
&gt;President of the United States:  William Jefferson Blythe Clinton.  
&gt;
&gt;    Clinton -- aided by his vile minions, the national "news" media -- 
&gt;went into raptures of ecstasy, listing all the ways that the freedom 
&gt;of Americans would have to be curtailed (Clinton has spoken of this 
&gt;before; it's a favorite theme of his) due to the heinous act he 
&gt;transparently hoped had been committed against TWA 800.  
&gt;
&gt;    Afterward, the round-heeled sprayheads obligingly searched out the 
&gt;usual street-cretins to rubberstamp Our Glorious Leader's latest Five 
&gt;Minute Plan, and add that they wouldn't mind at all paying extra for 
&gt;the "service" of having their inalienable rights violated even worse 
&gt;-- within the increasingly Bulgarian-style compounds American airports 
&gt;have become -- than they're being violated now.  
&gt;
&gt;    But there's a simpler, more effective way to prevent the criminal 
&gt;acts generally labelled "terrorism" that Clinton and his idiot-box 
&gt;doxies don't want anyone to know about. Behind virtually every 
&gt;terrorist attack we've ever seen or suffered, it's relatively easy to 
&gt;discover vicious and repeated acts of aggression against innocent 
&gt;individuals by the state. 
&gt;
&gt;    Preceeding the highly-publicized excesses of the Irish Republican 
&gt;Army, for example, we find 850 years of violent occupation by an 
&gt;exceptionally brutal foreign power that's managed to con the world 
&gt;into believing that it's civilized.  
&gt;
&gt;    Half a hundred years of Middle Eastern terror arise directly from 
&gt;the fact that, instead of coming to America -- the appropriate refuge 
&gt;for "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" -- either before or 
&gt;after World War II, European Jews decided to take somebody else's land 
&gt;away, and treat their victims the same way they themselves were 
&gt;treated by the Nazis.  (In fairness, at least before the war, would-be 
&gt;refugees from Hitler's terroristic state weren't given much choice, at 
&gt;least not by the American Medical Association, the American Bar 
&gt;Association, and the Roosevelt Administration, all of whom worked 
&gt;overtime, keeping out imported professional competition.)  
&gt;
&gt;    Similarly, there would never have been an Oklahoma City had there 
&gt;never been a Ruby Ridge or Waco.  If Clinton had any real interest in 
&gt;reducing the threat of "domestic terrorism" (he most assuredly does 
&gt;not: terrorism, like war before it, has become "the health of the 
&gt;state") instead of ratcheting government controls tighter around the 
&gt;necks of 250 million Americans who've done nothing wrong, he'd 
&gt;immediately arrest, try, convict, and punish all of those responsible 
&gt;for Ruby Ridge and Waco, abolish the outlaw agencies in whose names 
&gt;they were perpetrated, and repeal or nullify the unconstitutional laws 
&gt;which provided them their justification.  
&gt;
&gt;    The trouble is, he'd have to arrest, try, convict, and punish 
&gt;_himself_.  
&gt;
&gt;    Oh, yeah, the plan:  the best-kept "secret" of our overly- 
&gt;governmentalized age is that terrorism almost invariably 
&gt;_reactionary_; simply stop doing things -- things you shouldn't be 
&gt;doing anyway -- that cause terrorists to attack you and the attacks 
&gt;will stop. 
&gt;
&gt;    Terrorism is the price that governments -- and their hostage 
&gt;subjects -- pay for exercising illegitimate power.  Despite pundits 
&gt;whose ignorance is exceeded only by their presumption (_Wall Street 
&gt;Journal_'s Paul Gigot leaps immediately to mind) 20th century history 
&gt;demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that no further expansion of 
&gt;that power will do anything but make make the problem worse.  
&gt;
&gt;    Benjamin Franklin warned us, more or less, that anyone who trades 
&gt;liberty for safety is a fool, in part, because there ain't no such 
&gt;_thing_ as safety.
&gt;
&gt;    We're reminded by Amnesty International that more individuals have 
&gt;been murdered by governments in this century -- well over 100 million 
&gt;-- than have died in its wars (war itself being a government 
&gt;enterprise, as well), proving that government is a worse threat than 
&gt;anything it claims to protect us from.  Tragedies like TWA 800 is 
&gt;presumed to be, represent a failure of the _state_ -- of the very 
&gt;_idea_ of the state -- and it is the state, not individuals, that must 
&gt;be penalized, by reducing its income, and especially the power it 
&gt;wields over individual lives.  
&gt;
&gt;    Americans are famous the world over for doing what was never done 
&gt;before.  It's time we did something historically unprecedented again. 
&gt;We flew the first airplane; we sent the first men to the Moon. Both of 
&gt;those were possible _only_ because we were the first people ever to 
&gt;tell a King to go to hell.  
&gt;
&gt;    Now it's time to tell a President to go to hell. It's time to be 
&gt;the first people ever to _refuse_ to be steam-rollered out of our 
&gt;liberties by jackbooted thugs claiming to protect us from people and 
&gt;events that don't threaten any of us nearly as much as the thugs 
&gt;themselves.
