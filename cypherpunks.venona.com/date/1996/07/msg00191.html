Since I wrote most of the dispatch M. Nuri is talking about, I'll take a
moment to respond to his points below.

First, neither Brock nor I intends to "harass" the blocking software companies.

Seocnd, I wouldn't be nearly as skeptical of their efforts if they'd
honestly admit what they block. Right now, parents don't _know_ the extent
to which Junior is kept from educational and political sites.

This was the point of the article; I fear you missed it entirely.

&gt;sent this to Brock Meeks re: his latest column
&gt;I also ask cpunks not to harass these companies or their users--
&gt;it's a solution that's working.

&gt;From: "Vladimir Z. Nuri" &lt;vznuri@netcom.com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I read your columns regularly. outstanding work.
&gt;
&gt;regarding your recent dispatch: please do not harass the
&gt;blocking software companies too much. they are simply based
&gt;on a different premise than the regular net. the internet
&gt;starts out with, "everybody can access everything". they
&gt;start out with, "only stuff we approve of can be accessed".
&gt;
&gt;what their system shows is that you will always have disagreement
&gt;and controversy whenever this software is employed, whereever
&gt;subjectivity is involved. it is a very legitimate and worthwhile
&gt;service for parents who would rather "err on the side of caution".
&gt;
&gt;but far
&gt;better to have these organizations arguing &amp; bickering with who they
&gt;censor than to have the people who are censored suing the
&gt;government. the people who want free net access have it, and
&gt;are unbothered by these controversies.  in other words,
&gt;by moving the controversies to places where they are locally
&gt;contained (i.e. among the blockers and blockees) the rest
&gt;of the surfing public is unaffected and perhaps even protected
&gt;from harassment.
&gt;
&gt;so you see? there is all kinds of ranting about censorship going
&gt;on, but it has nothing to do with the way the vast majority uses
&gt;the internet. it's completely voluntary. it's the perfect solution.
&gt;so far, nothing the blocking companies do can affect the net as
&gt;a whole. they are largely predicated on that function.
&gt;
&gt;in a real sense they are providing very general services of
&gt;"rating web sites our customers will be most interested in".
&gt;and you realize, even the Point Communications awards are the
&gt;exact same thing.
&gt;
&gt;so again, please do not harass the companies. it's a solution
&gt;that does work. the existence of controversy does not prove
&gt;it doesn't work. it in fact proves that it does work.
&gt;
&gt;
