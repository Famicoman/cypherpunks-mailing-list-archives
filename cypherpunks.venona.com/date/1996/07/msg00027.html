The June 11 letter was from Jack King, a quite clueful and thoughtful D.C.
attorney who has been diligent in tracking the war on (some) drugs. Hardly
an alarmist.

Why can't I quite bring myself to trust "Barrie A. Vernon?"

&gt;   The Washington Post, July 1, 1996, p. A16.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   Technology and Privacy [Letter]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   In reference to the May 31 editorial "Plant Lights and
&gt;   Privacy" commenting on an 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
&gt;   decision to uphold the use of thermal imaging in cases
&gt;   involving indoor marijuana growing operations: The U.S.
&gt;   Supreme Court had just declined to review that 11th Circuit
&gt;   decision.
&gt;
&gt;   On June 11, The Post published a letter from Jack King
&gt;   ["When Government Can Look Through Walls"] warning us that
&gt;   thermal imaging, as developed by the military and as used
&gt;   by civilian law enforcement agencies with the cooperation
&gt;   of the military, posed an Orwellian threat to citizens
&gt;   because the government could use the technology to tell if
&gt;   two people were making love in the privacy of their
&gt;   bedroom.
&gt;
&gt;   To set the record straight, military thermal imaging is
&gt;   used to support civilian law enforcement only after other
&gt;   probable cause for a search warrant, such as power bills,
&gt;   observation of boarded-up windows, vents on the roof to
&gt;   draw away heat and buys by confidential informants, are
&gt;   documented. The military is then called in, using thermal
&gt;   imagers, to determine if there is an unusual heat source in
&gt;   the house as detected by heat escaping from the house. In
&gt;   dozens of cases where thermal imaging was used, I have not
&gt;   observed one case where it could detect the activity of
&gt;   people in a house, let alone a bedroom. I also have not
&gt;   observed the technology to have the ability to detect what
&gt;   people are doing in any room behind closed doors, covered
&gt;   windows and walls other than to detect blurs or shadows
&gt;   moving around behind light curtains.
&gt;
&gt;   The United States v. Cusumano language quoted by Mr. King
&gt;   was reversed last month by the court because the original
&gt;   three judges decided it was an issue that didn't need
&gt;   deciding, i.e. the constitutionality of thermal imaging
&gt;   absent a search warrant, and did not exercise "judicial
&gt;   restraint."
&gt;
&gt;   The trend to Mr. King's "militarization" of the war on
&gt;   drugs, based on a decision by then-secretary of defense
&gt;   Richard Cheney that drug use represented a threat to our
&gt;   national security, is being carried out with restraint,
&gt;   respect for the law and an appropriate appreciation for the
&gt;   privacy of our citizens.

&gt;   the Pentagon working in support of the counter-drug
&gt;   directorate.
