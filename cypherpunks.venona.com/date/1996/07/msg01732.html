&gt; &gt; Incidentally, if you are interested, I DO have a child (almost 2 yrs),
&gt; &gt; and I certainly would not even contemplate letting him have a gun (no
&gt; &gt; matter how well he can use it) until he can legal get one himself.  I
&gt; &gt; will certainly invoke serious wrath (on him and anyone else involved)
&gt; &gt; if I ever found him with a gun.
&gt; 
&gt;      Yes, those guns are evil things. Evil I tell you, constantly shooting
&gt; people for no reason, going off half-cocked and whooping it up all by 
&gt; their polished oiled ol selves.

Hmm.  Sarcasm?  Cannot definitively say, but I'll guess it is.

&gt;      Isn't it funny how otherwise rational people can ascribe intentions
&gt; and moral alignement (ie. good/evil) to an inert chunk of steel?

Assuming you are accusing me of such, you should probably point out
specifically where I said such a thing.  (If I did, it would be bad
grammar or some such, and I would certainly retract it.)

&gt;      He also taught me the basics of gun saftey, and made sure that
&gt; I took those classes that were available to me in the areas of gun 
&gt; saftey and marksmanship.

You might be missing the mark too, but I thought the subject was
giving a gun to every child who enters school, not YOURs or SOME
EXPERT 6 YEAR OLD's special case.

Yes, if every child was truly an exemplary God-fearing Christian,
I would probably have fewer objections to giving every child a
gun.  After all, they would NEVER use it in a fit of rage or
jealousy or any such sins ...  Right?

Death is permanent.  A child is prone to accidents.  Maybe those
of you who are just too "special" and "talented" don't need such
paternalistic frameworks, but I know my child cannot tell right
from wrong, good from bad.  He will get better over time.  But I
don't want another child to pay for my son's less than full
maturity by getting shot.
