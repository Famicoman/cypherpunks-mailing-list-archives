   RADICAL plans to take the genetic fingerprints of everyone in Britain
   and put them on a compulsory ID card are being considered by Labour.
   
   A database of DNA identities would be used to solve crimes and cut
   benefit fraud. Frank Field, tipped as a possible Social Security
   Secretary in a Labour government, has drafted proposals to produce a
   genetic database of the nation. Blood samples would taken from babies
   and from people applying to live in Britain.
   
   The samples would be used to extract DNA. Only identical twins have
   the same DNA, making it a more accurate fingerprint. Chris Smith,
   shadow social security secretary, confirmed that the party was
   examining the plans. "We are not ruling them out. We are determined to
   cleanse the national insurance system of fraud."
   
   John Wadham, director of the pressure group Liberty, said it was
   incredible that a senior Labour politician could suggest such a
   "draconian" measure which breaches European law. "There is no evidence
   that such a massive invasion of our privacy would do anything very
   much towards stopping crime."
   
   Mr Field, chairman of the Commons Social Security Select Committee,
   also advocates taking compulsory fingerprints from every citizen as a
   fall back to confirming a person's identity. The combination of
   genetic and physical fingerprints would be used to "rebuild the
   national insurance system", Mr Field said yesterday.
   
   Each person would be given a number at birth, combining national
   insurance and health numbers, which would tally with their genetic
   code. The information would go on a computerised identity card. It
   would also contain an individual's address, medical history or
   criminal record. It would be impossible to claim benefit without the
   card. Mr Field believes that Mr Blair is "sympathetic" to the
   proposals and that any opponents would be "Old Labour". Mr Blair will
   express his determination to reduce fraud in a speech tomorrow.
   
   Mr Field, MP for Birkenhead and described as one of Blair's "gurus",
   believes that the scheme would eradicate the use of multiple
   identities by benefit fraudsters and wipe off a large part of the
   annual £2.5 billion cost of social security fraud. There are millions
   of bogus national insurance numbers in circulation. It would also
   allow police to solve more crimes because traces of semen, hair or
   skin found at a burglary or rape would lead to the culprit.
   
   Ann Widdecombe, the Home Office Minister, said: "There are huge
   practical and resource implications. Think what it would cost to test
   every person in the country." Mr Wadham said there was no guarantee
   that the benefits would follow. "Not all fraud is to do with bogus
   national insurance numbers. I do not understand why, even if you have
   an identity card, you would need a genetic database."
   
   Mr Field advocates setting up a commission to regulate the use of the
   information. It is unlikely that any policy would be announced before
   the general election. Mr Blair, who is known to be looking for radical
   ideas on social security, has told shadow ministers to "think the
   unthinkable" and remind the public that "with rights come
   responsibilities".
