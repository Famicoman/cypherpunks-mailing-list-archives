Here's some trouble-making I'm doing on another list (one that believes in
X.509 certs and CAs).... :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you have encountered an old friend of yours on the net and want to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;sure that you can exchange keys with her without some active eavesdropper
&gt;&gt;&gt;getting in the path and substituting keys, then a CA's cert is probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;worthless to you.  [I have a paper at this month's USENIX Security Symposium
&gt;&gt;&gt;on this subject.]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I want to understand why the "CA's cert" above is worthless.  Assuming the
&gt;&gt;"CA's cert" is a self signed certificate identifying a CA, then is it
&gt;&gt;worthless because it is an untrusted CA, or because my old friend and I
&gt;&gt;don't have personal certificates signed by this CA?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Couldn't wait for the paper :-)
&gt;
&gt;OK -- at the risk of boring the list... :)
&gt;
&gt;There are many definitions for "identity".  In this one case, I'm using the
&gt;example of an old friend.  We meet again on the net and want to trade keys,
&gt;for private communications.  Much of the loose talk over the years about
&gt;certificates says that if she and I have certificates from a good CA, then
&gt;we can be assured we aren't being spoofed.  That statement isn't true.
&gt;
&gt;To state it more formally, a CA's certificate in this case is neither
&gt;necessary nor sufficient.
&gt;
&gt;The CA binds a key to *its name for a person* -- trying to make that name
&gt;globally unique and meaningful -- but all it can promise is to make the name
&gt;unique.  It can't promise to make it meaningful *to me*.  The CA is not
&gt;aware of my existence, much less of what I know about each person in the
&gt;world.  There might be 100 certificates for "Sue Robinson" -- with various
&gt;other information to distinguish them from one another -- but when I knew
&gt;her she was going under the name of Laura and I have no clue what her other
&gt;distinguishing information is.  I had lost touch with her.
&gt;
&gt;I could ask her, over the net, and she would tell me all those new bits of
&gt;information.
&gt;
&gt;Trouble is, I need an authenticated channel to her in order to be sure I'm
&gt;not being spoofed while she tells me her SNail address (or whatever makes
&gt;her cert unique).  I can't get an authenticated channel without the cert.
&gt;Impasse.
&gt;
&gt;Thus the cert from the CA is not sufficient.
&gt;
&gt;It is also not necessary.  The paper I'm presenting gives a protocol with
&gt;which Sue and I can use our shared memories (what makes us old friends in
&gt;the first place and, in a real sense, the *true* definition of "identity")
&gt;to prove to each other that there is no eavesdropper over a confidential
&gt;channel we create.  Once we've done that, we then we can tell each other our
&gt;keys and each issue a cert for the other's key.  At that point, we have
&gt;certified keys for each other without involving a CA.  What's better, I have
&gt;her certified key from a "CA" I can trust above all others -- myself.
&gt;
&gt;[QED]
