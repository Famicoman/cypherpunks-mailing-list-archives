I attended a school in the Pittsburgh area that had an active recruiting
effort centered in Philadelphia.  Thus, most of the black students were
from inner-city Philly.  What I noticed about their failure to show up in
upper level math/science classes was that they had to spend too much time in
remedial classes to undo the damage done by city schools.

Considering the percentage of America's black population that lives in
urban areas, that seems to explain the lack of black representation.

Even more distressing on the whole was the lack of female students in
the Comp. Sci. department ... but that's another story.

As for the slang, I don't think it's going to attract white kids from
the suburbs either.  Screw the stereotypes, it's a little too close
to the "They could but they don't have the drive/will/intelligence" arguments
to say that Dilbert cartoons are going to turn off a "brother in the hood"
to math/science.  

Also, most of the Asian students at my school were not US citizens.  Most were
from China or Japan.
