(New York, NY):  The Internet had been called the world's largest Enterprise 
Zone -- a place where small business people and entrepreneurs can compete with 
corporate giants.  But to make it work, a business must master the ways of the 
Net -- how to target on-line customers, how to present products and services 
with style, and how to keep sites and transactions secure.

That's why  Winn Schwartau and Chris Goggans, internet experts with first hand 
knowledge of both the potential and dangers of the Internet, have created The 
Complete Internet Business Toolkit ($34.95, Van Nostrand Reinhold, ISBN 
0-42-02222-0) -- the first comprehensive manual for setting up, operating and 
defending a business in Cyberspace.

In The Complete Internet Business Toolkit, two of the digital age's savviest 
cybernauts offer all the information and tools needed to establish, maintain, 
expand and protect Net enterprises. This complete resources includes information
on common pitfalls, security measures, and payment methods needed to open up 
shop on the Internet.

&gt;From the basics of how to get on line to the mechanisms needed to protect credit
card transactions and use Cybercash, Schwartau and Goggans provide businesses 
with a step by step approach to creating a secure, functional and user-friendly 
on-line business.  The Complete Internet Toolkit will:

* Outline how a business can easily expand by taking advantage 
 of the Internet and its myriad resources.
* Demonstrate how to design a web page that will capture the 
 attention of cyber-customers.
* Review all of the current major security software for conducting 
  financial transactions on the Internet.

The Complete Internet Toolkit also includes a bonus CD-ROM with more than 5,000 
files. In a matter of minutes, it can download Web browsers, SLIP/PPP drivers, 
digital cash and encryption programs, graphics and animation viewers, 
compression utilities, and other key programs for navigating the Internet. THE 
BOOK CONTAINS CRYPTOGRAPHY TOOLS BANNED OUTSIDE THE U.S.

Far from another dry, reference book, The Complete Internet BusinessToolkit is 
written in clear and entertaining style and is designed for the small business 
owner or the individual poised to overcome any challenge in order to stake out 
their claim in Cyberspace.
