   Excerpts of four reports on the G7+1 antiterrorism meet in 
   Paris: 
 
 
   WSJ: 
 
 
      + Mass Transport: The International Civil Aviation 
      Organization will implement new standards for bomb 
      detection at domestic and international airports. The 
      eight nations will jointly develop standards for more 
      detailed and accurate passenger and cargo lists, as well 
      as new vehicle-identification tagging methods to make 
      car-bombing investigations easier, U.S. officials said. 
 
 
      + Information Sharing: The U.S Federal Bureau of 
      Investigation will lead an effort to develop an 
      international forensic database. The FBI offered to 
      share certain computer records with the other seven 
      countries. 
 
 
      + Wiretapping and Internet: The eight countries said 
      they would develop new lawful means to intercept 
      communications among terrorists. They agreed to study 
      how to prevent the Internet from becoming a tool for 
      planning and executing terrorist events. 
 
 
      + Explosives Tracing: The U.S. will share its research 
      on new technologies to trace the origin of explosive 
      devices U.S. officials said, and will push for 
      international use of such technologies if they are found 
      to be workable. 
 
 
      + Other Measures: Controlling trade in certain weapons 
      and chemicals financing of terrorist organizations and 
      forgery of travel documents also will be studied. 
 
 
   WaPo: 
 
 
      The 25-point plan calls for close cooperation in 
      formulating a range of security measures, including 
      tightened controls on firearms and explosives; 
      prevention of terrorist communications on the Internet; 
      improved bomb detection methods at airports; and 
      interdiction of terrorist groups' financial resources. 
      They also called for the expediting of extradition 
      procedures and faster exchanges of information on 
      terrorist activities, including any use of chemical, 
      biological or nuclear materials. Details on all 25 
      points were left for law enforcement and forensic 
      experts to work out, with deadlines for finalization of 
      specific measures set for 90 days to six months. 
 
 
   FiTi: 
 
      Among the measures agreed in Paris were an accelerated 
      programme of research designed to find ways to mark 
      explosives so their origin could be identified after a 
      blast; the development of ways to prevent terrorists 
      using electronic or wire communication systems, 
      including the Internet and tougher sentences. The 
      ministers also called for investigations into 
      organisations with social, charitable and cultural goals 
      which were abused by terrorists; restrictions on asylum- 
      seeking by those who had committed attacks or were 
      suspected of planning or funding them; and more 
      effective border controls and extradition procedures. 
 
 
   NYP: 
 
      The details were not all made public today, but the 
      measures the officials agreed to draft included devising 
      methods to monitor terrorist attempts to communicate 
      over the Internet; developing standards to make it 
      easier to trace the origin of explosives used in 
      terrorist bombs and cracking down domestically on the 
      manufacture, sale, transport and export of explosives 
      and firearms.
