&gt; &gt;Talk shows that attempt to stimulate active thought on reasonable premise 
&gt; &gt;generally do not survive long in syndication. With Limbaugh's show, it 
&gt; &gt;took a double hit as the markets it played to were for the most part late night. 
&gt; &gt;BTW, this comes from actually looking it up in past TV Guides - not 
&gt; &gt;mindlessly drooling over the radio - so put away the "he's lying" crap.
&gt; And why did the networks put Rush on so late? Could it be that
&gt; he did not pull in the viewers?

     Not the networks, the local stations. Each station decides where to 
slot a specific non-network show. 

     In many time slots he was competing sucessfully with The Late Show, and 
The Other Idiot (sorry, it has been a long time since I watched TV, so I 
can't remember the other idiots name). 

     In one city he was place opposite Oprah Winfrey, and _still_ had decent
ratings, but the TV stations got a lot more complaints about him at 3 in the
afternoon, so they put him on after midnight.

&gt; &gt;Following the shallow logic of your argument, Limbaugh is not a success 
&gt; &gt;because he does not broadcast on TV. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is shallow logic, but it is Rush's own logic. He promotes the
&gt; idea that success is measured in ecconomic terms. The failure of his
&gt; TV show demonstrates the failure of his ideas under the criteria 
&gt; which he himself espouses.

     His TV show did not suceed or fail because of what Limbaugh did, but 
rather on decesions that were totally out of his hands. That is why he
is not renewing his contracts. 

&gt; &gt;If you firmly believe the premise that Fascism was the root cause behind 
&gt; &gt;OKC, then you have no choice but to look to the White House and Capital 
&gt; &gt;Hill. 
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, I look to the millitas, Chritian Identity, the Klu Klux Klan 
&gt; and their appologists including Liddy and Limbaugh. If you read
&gt; the propaganda that the NAZIs used you will find it if anything 
&gt; less direct than Liddy or Buchannan. The NAZIs did not advertise their
&gt; intention to commit mass murder, they used code words. When Buchannan
&gt; refers to "Hose" he is using a codeword he knows will be understood.

     Please do not lump all militias in with the Chistian Identity &amp; Klan 
types, you just display more and more ignorance.
