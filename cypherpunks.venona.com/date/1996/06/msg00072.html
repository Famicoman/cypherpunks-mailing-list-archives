I just received some information on IRC channel #scientology that 
Julf Helsinghuis is being sued by $cientology *yet again* for a name.

Apparently this has to do with the deposition request to Homer Wilson 
Smith (lightlink.com).  Scamizdat #3 was posted through lightlink.com 
and the $cientologists have wanted for a long time to figure out who 
did it.  (Which is why they sued Grady Ward.)  Homer, in response to 
the deposition request, consulted his logs, and said that the 
original post came from penet.fi.  So $cientology has apparently gone 
to the Finns again to ask that Julf be forced to give up the name.

I'm appending a copy of the IRC log, as I'm too lazy to edit it down 
to particulars.  It includes the name of the police officer involved 
(Kaj Malmberg) as well as a Finnish newsgroup and article id for the 
whole story.  If someone knows Finnish and can give a rough 
translation, it would be terribly appreciated by a lot of people.

&lt;enclosed IRC transcript&gt;

&lt;Ignatius&gt; hi guys... do you have the latest news on Julf 
   Helsingius' case?
&gt; Ig: what do you mean, latest news?
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; The julf case?
* Sherilyn didn;t know there _was_ a julf case...
&lt;Ignatius&gt; ok... copyright offences are crimes under Finnish 
   law, not torts. 
&lt;Ignatius&gt; Kaj Malmberg, the Finnish police officer who handles 
   the investigation of the copyrighted material through 
   penet.fi, posted an article to a domestic newsgroup today. 
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; Do you have the message-id and group name?
&lt;Ignatius&gt; the scienos have filed a motion at a local court in 
   Helsinki to force Julf Helsingius to give out the name of 
   the poster. 
&lt;Ignatius&gt; sherilyn, are you good at Finnish?
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; ig: lol!
&lt;skaplin&gt; Who posted what through penet??
&lt;Ignatius&gt; the hearing is scheduled for the beginning of next 
   week... perhaps already tomorrow. 
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; So was penet the server before lightlink in the 
   scamizdat case?
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; Homer gave them the name of the prior server, or was 
   going to 
*** skaplin changes topic to "Penet under attack...Again!"
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; Well this needs to be put out loud on groups where 
   people use penet
&lt;skaplin&gt; Ignatus: How good are you at translating?
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; Last attack on penet got the scientologists a very 
   bad rep
&gt; Ig: We need that post.
&gt; IN ENGLISH
&gt; ASAP!
&gt; even if it's a lousy translation.
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; This cop guy speaks English
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; Didn't he post in English to a.r.s.?
&gt; Sheri: he may not want to post it on a.r.s
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; It's true, skap
&lt;Ignatius&gt; i don't know more than what I already mentioned. The 
   police officer didn't even mention Scientology; he just 
   mentioned that he was investigating a copyright offence. 
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; She would make a lovely domina
&gt; sheri: you should see what I'm reading now :)
&lt;skaplin&gt; We're sure penet is under attack for a name though...
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; Bloody hell fire!
&lt;Sherilyn&gt; I have 6440 posts downloading!
&lt;Ignatius&gt; i'm writing an article to post to the ng:s, but it's 
   obvious we don't have all the bits of the puzzle yet. 
&lt;skaplin&gt; Want some kippers with your spam sheri?? :)
&lt;skaplin&gt; Ignatus: What newsgroup was it in?
&gt; ig: please post it asap.
&gt; also, send it to rnewman@cybercom.net.
&lt;Ignatius&gt; skap, sfnet.keskustelu.laki; &lt;4os5bu$flp@idefix.eunet.fi&gt; 
&lt;Ignatius&gt; the police officer, Kaj Malmberg, is at 
   kaj.malmberg@helsinki.poliisi.fi
