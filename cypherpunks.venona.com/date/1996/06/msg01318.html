&gt;In a historic first that demonstrates the increasing power of the Internet
&gt;Community as a political force, HotWired, DIGEX, the Voters
&gt;Telecommunications Watch, and the Center for Democracy and Technology have
&gt;teamed up to provide a live, interactive "cybercast" of the Senate Commerce
&gt;Subcommittee encryption hearing on Wednesday June 26.
&gt;
&gt;The "cybercast" will provide netizens concerned about privacy and security
&gt;on the Internet the ability to participate in the hearing, ask questions of
&gt;the witnesses, and submit comments for the record.  Details on how you can
&gt;participate are printed below.
&gt;
&gt;This hearing is the second encryption hearing held before the Senate
&gt;Subcommittee on Science, Space and Technology; the first hearing was held
&gt;on June 12.  Subcommittee Chair Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) presided over both
&gt;hearings.
&gt;

Of course except for PRZ they didn't invite anyone who cares about privacy
(see later in this msg) What a fucking joke. Typical statist.

&gt;TELL CONGRESS WHY ENCRYPTION IS IMPORTANT TO YOU - ADD YOUR VOICE TO THE
&gt;CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
&gt;
&gt;Senator Burns, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and the other sponosors of the
&gt;Pro-CODE bill want to hear from the Net.community about why encryption is
&gt;important to privacy and security on the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;Please be sure to visit <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/">http://www.crypto.com/</A> and add your voice to the
&gt;debate over encryption policy on Capitol Hill.  Responses will be tabulated
&gt;and the results, along with selected statements, will be included in the
&gt;Congressional Record by Senator Conrad Burns.  The restults will also be
&gt;featured during the Security and Freedom through Encryption Forum (SAFE) on
&gt;July 1 (details on that event are attached below).
&gt;
&gt;To add your voice to the crypto debate in Congress, visit:

&gt;

Right. Sure. And then they have a record of all the ppl interested in
cryptoprivacy (keep reading)

&gt;ATTEND THE SAFE FORUM - JULY 1, 1996 STANFORD CALIFORNIA
&gt;
&gt;On July 1, 1996, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley at Stanford
&gt;University, members of Congress, prominent computer industry leaders and
&gt;privacy advocates will meet to discuss the need to reform U.S. encryption
&gt;policy.
&gt;
&gt;The event is FREE and open to the public, but space is limited and is going
&gt;fast.  To find out more, and to reserve your free ticket, visit the SAFE
&gt;Forum Web Page at:

And sign up for a free trip to the roundup of people who want privacy. Coming
soon to a police state near you. WHY THE FUCK DO THEY NEED TO KNOW YOUR
NAME FOR THIS SHIT??? WHY IS NO ONE ASKING THIS???

Look carefully at who's sponsoring this. Who are they, and where does
the money come from? Hint: three letters.

Notice how they don't use PGP to sign the msg? Wonder why?
