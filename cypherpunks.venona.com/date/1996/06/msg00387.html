[Dear Friend-of-VTW,

 During our "Turn the Web Black campaign", you wrote us regarding that
 protest.  Because of the success of that campaign, we are asking you
 to participate again in another net-campaign to draw attention to the
 upcoming decision in the lawsuit to challenge the net censorship
 legislation.  This information is not widely available yet, and I would
 appreciate it if you did not redistribute this.

 Because you helped us out during the highly successful "Turn the Web
 Black" campaign, we are giving you advanced notice of this effort before
 we tell anyone else.

NEWS - A DECISION IN THE COURT CASE IS NEAR

The fate of the Internet and the future of the First Amendment in the
information age hang in the balance.  As early as this week, three federal
judges in Philadelphia are poised to issue a ruling in the law suit
challenging the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which restricts
constitutionally protected speech on the Internet.

Will the court rule that the CDA is unconstitutional? That the Internet is
a unique communications technology that deserves the same First Amendment
protections enjoyed by the print media? Or will the court side with Senator
Exon, conservative "pro-family" groups, and the Justice Department who have
argued that the government is the best judge of what material is
appropriate online.

Regardless of the outcome, the decision will have a profound impact on the
future of the Internet as a medium for free expression, education, and
commerce.

JOIN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUR FELLOW NETIZENS IN ANNOUNCING THE DECISION

When the Communications Decency Act was signed into law by President
Clinton on February 8, 1996, the World Wide Web went black in protest.
When the decision in the historic legal challenge to the CDA is announced,
join tens of thousands of your fellow netizens in spreading the word on the
decision and its impact.

This campaign follows in the steps of the Turn the Web Black campaign,
which was a tremendous success.  Believe it or not, many Internet users
had only superficial knowledge about the proposed law and the enormous
press coverage and online awareness afterwards mobilized large numbers
of people.

In addition to the online campaign, there are currently rallies planned for
New York, press conferences from the CIEC and the ACLU, and a net campaign
to raise awareness to the decision and the effects it will have on free
speech.

The result of the first CDA decision is an extremely important milestone in
the fight for free speech online.  Will the net look more like print, or
more like Saturday morning television?

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE:

In anticipation of the decision, you can help keep your fellow Netizens

BACKGROUND: WHAT IS THE CDA?

The Communications Decency Act was passed as part of the Telecommunications
Reform bill in February 1996.  The law seeks to protect minors from
objectionable or sexually explicit material on the Internet by imposing
stiff criminal penalties on the "display" of "indecent" or "patently
offensive" material online.

Opponents to the new law argue that while well intentioned, the CDA fails
to account for the unique nature of the Internet, and that it will have a
far-reaching chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech online.
On a global, decentralized communications medium like the Internet, the
only effective and constitutional means of controlling access to
objectionable material is to rely on users and parents, not the government,
to decide what material is or is not appropriate.

Two lawsuits have been filed to challenge the constitutionality of the CDA
in a Philadelphia federal court. The cases have been consolidated and an
decision is expected in early June 1996.

The cases have been brought, respectively, by The Citizens Internet
Empowerment Coalition (CIEC), comprised of civil Liberties groups,
libraries, Internet Service Providers, Commercial Online Service Providers,
Newspaper, Magazine and Book Publishers, and over 45,000 individual
internet users, and a coalition of civil liberties groups, authors, and
others organized by the ACLU.

Detailed information on the legal challenges, as well as information about
the CDA, is available at the following web sites:
