&gt;OECD NEWS RELEASE - Paris, 10 May 1996 
&gt;
&gt;OECD EXPERTS BEGIN DRAFTING CRYPTOGRAPHY GUIDELINES 
&gt;
&gt;Cryptography experts from OECD countries have begun drafting a
&gt;proposal for OECD Cryptography Policy Guidelines that governments can
&gt;use as a guide to formulate their national policies on encryption. 
&gt;
&gt;Many governments are under pressure within their own countries to
&gt;develop a national position on cryptography, 

This is bullshit.  If anything, it's exactly the opposite:  It is the 
GOVERNMENTS and those who hold government jobs who are doing the 
"pressuring."    I haven't seen more than a trickle of desire for a 
"national position on cryptography."  What Internet-people want is the 
ELIMINATION of a "national position on cryptography," I think.

&gt;which is used in computer
&gt;technology to protect everything from product designs to health and
&gt;tax records and global correspondence. But the needs of global
&gt;technologies and applications require an international --rather than a
&gt;strictly national -- approach to policymaking.

In other words, various Constitutions are getting in the way!  Tough!

&gt; The fast-paced
&gt;development of the Global Information Infrastructure adds an element
&gt;of urgency.

In other words, the governments are feeling that the situation is getting 
out of their control!  Excellent, that's progress.

&gt;
&gt;The business community, individuals and national security and law enforcement
&gt;agencies are all pressing for encryption guidelines

BULL!  The businesses are saying, "Don't restrict crypto."  The individuals 
are saying, "Don't restrict crypto!"  

So-called "law enforcement" agencies are saying, "We're losing control of 
the public!  Where's '1984' when we need it!"


&gt; and the OECD will strive to
&gt;reflect the legitimate interests of all these groups as it drafts Guidelines. 

I don't think so.


&gt;The private sector is closely involved in drafting the Guidelines,
&gt;with business representatives from the Business and Industry Advisory
&gt;Committee (BIAC) participating at the meeting. 

Gee, what about THE INDIVIDUALS?  You know, the ones you steal your tax 
money from?  That's right, the peons.


&gt;The OECD meeting, which took place on 8 May, was hosted by the US
&gt;Department of State in Washington DC.

That's because the USG is the most unhappy, because its Constitution is 
making it very difficult to ban crypto.

 It was held immediately after a
&gt;Second Business Government Forum on Global Cryptography Policy in
&gt;Washington DC on 7 May, which was cosponsored by the OECD, the 
&gt;International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Business and Industry Advisory
&gt;Committee (BIAC) to the OECD.

It probably had a similar lack of participation by ordinary citizens and 
netizens.  Do I detect a pattern here?

&gt; Two similar conferences took place in Paris in
&gt;December, when OECD countries and business representatives met for the
&gt;first time to discuss international cryptography policy. 

Probably because they had gotten wind a few months before of a serious 
potential danger to the continued hegemony of governments over the people.

&gt;
&gt;The process of drafting the OECD Cryptography Policy Guidelines will
&gt;continue at an experts meeting in June and is due for completion in
&gt;early 1997.

It's already too late!


&gt;For further information, please contact Ms. Hiroko Kamata, OECD 
&gt;Directorate for Science, 
&gt;Technology and Industry (tel. 331 45 24 80 04 - fax. 331 45 24 93 32 - 
&gt;e-mail. hiroko.kamata@oecd.org).
