                           An Open Letter to Business Owners
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                     "Here's The Information You Requested About Your
                                    Free 800 Telephone Number"

Dear Friend:

In todays Competitive Business Environment an 800# is no longer a luxury.

It's an Absolute Necessity!

Unfortunately even modest volume 800# responses can tie up your office
phone and monopolize your staff's time at all the wrong moments. 

The alternative --- a remote 800# voice mail service --- is the ideal
solution. 

Except for one small detail: they cost at least $25.00 per month plus 18-22
cents per minute. That's $300.00 per year plus an outrageous charge per
minute for all usage!

Compare that to the BEST 800# Phone Deal in the country!

 * Set-up Fee                        	$0.00
 * Monthly Service Charge	$0.00
 * Term Commitment	None	
 * Annual Fee		None	
 * Cost Per Minute		.11/min  (Even lower, if you move fast - see                                                                               below)

This 800# service is yours absolutely FREE when you get your own
InteleCard(sm) --- the most advanced portable business
Telecommunications Center imaginable. 

It's a Virtual "Pocket Office" which puts you right in the thick of the most
Advanced Telecommunications Technology. 

Your incredible "Smart Card" will make the world believe you are sitting at
the helm of a giant multi-national conglomerate! 

This exceptional 800# service puts the control in your hands! 

You can either have the messages captured by your personal voice mailbox
or you can re-route the calls to ring directly into your office or home. 

The choice is yours! 

You can change your mind anytime, anywhere you want --- even have your
calls follow you as you travel!

The InteleCard(sm) does it all for you!

          * Sends, Stores and Retrieves Faxes!
          * Broadcasts Messages!
          * Call Forwarding --- Never miss an important call again!
          * Instant Conference Call Capability --- Up to 70 people worldwide!
          * Message/Pager Notification &amp; Delivery!
          * Speed Dialing --- Program up to 99 numbers!    
          * And...Free 800# Service --- Your personal box accessed through
            your private PIN number!
          * Plus MORE !!

Plus..."The Best Pre-Paid Calling Card In The Business"

          * Only $.22 per minute U.S. (17.5 if you move fast!) 
          * Excellent, low International rates!

Simply put...

 "This Is The Best Telephone Deal You will Ever Get...Period!" 

But, it's not going to be here for long. 

The exceptionally Low Introductory, Promotional rates illustrated above are
only in effect through the 21st of June. After that, normal retail rates
apply. The 800# service goes up to .11 per minute and the calling card
charge increases to .22 per minute. 

But if you order your card before the deadline, your rates are grand-
fathered in for life! 

That means, no matter how high the rates may rise for other subscribers,
you have locked in your bargain basement prices for as long as you have
your card. 

There is a very limited supply of these deeply-discounted, promotional
cards available. Once they are gone, no more will ever be offered again.

                     "Your No-Risk, Unconditional Guarantee"

Inspect your InteleCard(sm) for 30 days entirely at our risk. Closely examine
every one of its exceptional features. Calculate the hundreds of dollars it
will save you year after year. Carefully weigh its unmatched convenience
and ease of use. Then, if for any reason you don't agree it is far and away
the best telecommunications deal you ever made, simply return the unused
card for an immediate refund. No questions asked. 

What could possibly be more fair?

                                      The InteleCard(sm)

                Are You Really Ready For All The Extra Business
                               These Services Will Get You?

&lt;$&gt; Instant Call Forwarding...Use this service to forward all your calls ---
       even to your cellular phone!

       InteleCard(sm) let's you conference up to 70 people into the same
       conversation from any phone --- without an operator. You save $50 or
       more in service charges!

        you up in plenty of time for an important appointment!

       Once you're connected to the toll-free 800#, you can get all your       
       messages and faxes and make as many local or long distance 
       (Including International) calls as you wish!

&lt;$&gt; Your Electronic Secretary...Reminds you of birthdays, anniversaries,
       important meetings, etc. --- up to 1 year into the future!

         only 11 cents a minute?

&lt;$&gt; Unbelievably Low Cost...This entire collection of high-tech services
       could easily cost you $25...$50...$75 or more a month! Instead, it's

Because of the restricted quantity available, each business is limited to
only seven cards.

I urge you to order several today and beat the June 21st deadline. 

Once this supply is exhausted, you will have to purchase the newer, more
expensive cards. 

Remember, there is never a monthly charge or annual renewal fee with the
InteleCard(sm). Many businesses control their costs and internal
communication systems by providing a card to each key employee (not to
