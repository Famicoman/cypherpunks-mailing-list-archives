The Western Institute of Computer Science announces
a week-long course on

INTERNET SECURITY

taught at Stanford University

July 29 -- August 2, 1996

by Arthur M. Keller (Stanford University)
David H. Crocker (Brandenburg Consulting)
Tina M. Darmohray (Information Warehouse!)
Whitfield Diffie (Sun Microsystems)
Mark Eichin (Cygnus Support)
Alan Fedeli (IBM)
Gail Grant (Open Market)
Lance Hoffman (George Washington University)
Peter G. Neumann (SRI International)
Allan Schiffman (Terisa Systems)

A Practical Week-long Course for Consultants, Educators, Government
and Industry Scientists and Engineers

This course is taught by leading researchers and practitioners in the
area of internet security: Arthur M. Keller, Dave Crocker, Tina M.
Darmohray, Whitfield Diffie, Mark Eichin, Alan Fedeli, Gail Grant,
Lance Hoffman, Peter Neumann, and Allan M. Schiffman.  Participants
will receive a grounding in internet security, familiarity with
current concepts and issues, and exposure to the most important
research and development trends in the area.

Connecting to the Internet brings both unparalleled information
resources and unparalleled security dangers.  Protecting computer
systems and networks from attacks is a critical and ongoing process.
Equally important is protecting corporate intellectual property
assets from inappropriate access.  This course will examine a variety of
network security topics, including protecting against intrusion,
detecting and tracking intruders, and repairing damage after
intrusion.

The course will being with a survey of risk analysis and setting up
emergency responses to network incidents.  We then follow with a
detailed description of cryptography, including cryptographic policy
and a panel.  The course will then cover specific security
technologies.  These include network firewalls (which provide
perimeter security), Kerberos and adding security to existing network
applications, secure messaging, secure payments, and World Wide Web
security (including SSL).  This course will also analyze security
issues for electronic commerce.  We will also show a videotape
presentation on SATAN by Dan Farmer, one of its developers, and a
videotape presentation by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura on
Takedown.

TEXT: Building_in_Big_Brother, Lance Hoffman, and a complete set of
course notes.

PREREQUISITES: This course assumes a general knowledge of
computers and using the Internet.

WHO SHOULD ATTEND: Computer programmers, system managers, computer
operations staff and managers, information technologists and managers,
and teachers who want to gain insight into the capabilities,
implementation and current trends in this emerging technology.

internetworking capabilities since 1972, first as part of the Arpanet
research community and more recently in the commercial sector.  Mr.
Crocker has made extensive contributions to the development of
electronic mail and other Internet services.  He has worked at a
number of Silicon Valley companies, producing a wide range of TCP/IP,
OSI, and network management products.  He serves as Chairman of the
non-profit Silicon Valley - Public Access Link, a community network
information service.  Mr. Crocker continues technical involvement in
Internet standards activities for transport services, electronic mail
and electronic commerce.

TINA M. DARMOHRAY is a senior consultant for Information Works!, which
