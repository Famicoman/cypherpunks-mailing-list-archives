&gt;Subject: Re: INteresting tidbit
&gt;

&gt;On the Encryption note, and I swear not along the lines of the 'DOJ' 
&gt;and 'FBI Snooping' Big-Brother events, I heard another story recently.
&gt;
&gt;# begin story
&gt;
&gt;A person working on the MBONE project did an unannounced experiment
&gt;across the internet using Triple-DES for MBONE, and the very next day, 
&gt;'ATF' agents knocked on his door and warned him against exporting 
&gt;munitions.  The experimentor was shaken by the fact that agents 
&gt;approached him so quickly after the experiment.
&gt;
&gt;# end story
&gt;
&gt;Extrapolations of fact:
&gt;   1.   Internet traffic is monitored.
&gt;   2.   The ability to snoop for encrypted traffic is present
&gt;   3.   The ability to identify encryption levels is present
&gt;        (How else can they differentiate DES-1 from DES-3?)
&gt;   4.   The ability to crack DES-1 in near real-time mode is present.
&gt;        (See above).
First, this has been loosely confirmed for ages. Someone was mentioning
that FBI offices 
supposedly have software that (on a 486) can crack a DES-1 key in under
an hour. Multiply * 
modern high capacity computers = problem.  However, this does not
nessesarily follow from 
#3. First off, you could probably tell the encryption used from a file
format; the software 
on the other end has to know what it's getting. Secondly, you could
probably tell quite a 
lot about what was used by some intense analysis.
Finally, if their software cannot read it and analysis suggested it was
more than DES-1 
then they might go after someone w/o being able to read the document in
question.
&gt;   5.   If above=true, then Feds dropping the Zimmerman PGP case probably
&gt;        also points to it also being crackable in a similar manner.
Not necessarily. This freemen issue shows that the FBI is getting gunshy
about bad 
publicity, which they were getting.
&gt;   6.   Using encryption only flags traffic for capture and decryption, 
&gt;        using strong encryption makes you all that more interesting.
Sounds like the old argument for encrypting everything...

&gt;Sorry, couldn't resist.  I'll try not to start a threads about 
&gt;electro-plasma propulsion craft at Area 51, metallic-ceramic skin 
&gt;and pulse-jets on the Aurora spy plane, heat-imaging video cameras 
&gt;on satellites and planes that can watch you through your houses' roof, 
&gt;etc.  :)

What??? Now you're going to tell us X-Files is just a TV show? &lt;g&gt;
