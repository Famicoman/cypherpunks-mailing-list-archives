Whether it's a good idea or not -- and I'm told that it could violate FEC
rules -- it's not going to happen.

A campaign spokesperson told me that "Harry refuses" to take the cash, period.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yes, Harry Browne has raised enough money to qualify for matching funds
&gt;&gt;from the FEC. But he's unable to give out the cash or use it to pay down
&gt;&gt;the gvt debt since doing so could violate FEC regulations. The FEC is also
&gt;&gt;unwilling only to certify Browne for matching funds without giving it to
&gt;&gt;him -- he's got to take the money and spend it on campaign foo and nothing
&gt;&gt;else, says the government. Finally, once they give you cash you have to
&gt;&gt;meet a higher degree of scrutiny, which costs money in lawyers and
&gt;&gt;accountants.
&gt;&gt;Talk about bureaucracy.
&gt;&gt;At least this is what the party tells me. I'll be covering their
&gt;&gt;convention, which is in DC a few weeks from now.
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that since paying people funds that were stolen from them
&gt;would produce good publicity, which by definition could be argued to be
&gt;spending it on the campaign.  Sure, it's a non-traditional tactic, but that
&gt;doesn't mean it's in violation of the campaign law.  They could also email
&gt;along a set of libertarian literature, and the recipient would certify that
&gt;he would promote the libertarian cause and work for the election of the
&gt;candidate, etc, etc.
&gt;
&gt;As for "lawyers and accountants":  I'm sure there are enough
&gt;libertarian-leaning lawyers and accountants around who would be willing to
&gt;help out to make this project a net positive.  Remember, the publicity is
&gt;the important thing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;In 1996, the Libertarian Party will apparently qualify for Federal matching
&gt;&gt;&gt;funds for its Presidential political campaign.  That does not mean that it
&gt;&gt;&gt;will _accept_ them, being stolen goods.  However, a few years ago I heard of
&gt;&gt;&gt;an idea that they should accept the money, and return it to the people, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;small amount at a time, to whomever asks for it.  Besides returning the
&gt;&gt;&gt;stolen money to its rightful owners, that would produce substantial positive
&gt;&gt;&gt;publicity for the Libertarian party, embarrassment for the Democrats and
&gt;&gt;&gt;Republicans, while at the same time reducing the amount of money available
&gt;&gt;&gt;for the D's and the R's.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;But there's been a practical question of how to actively do this,
&gt;&gt;&gt;economically.  Issuing checks and mailing them costs money, and they're
&gt;&gt;&gt;traceable, etc.    The advent of digital cash suggests an answer: Make the
&gt;&gt;&gt;payments in the form of digital cash, payable on the Web.  This will
&gt;&gt;&gt;encourage the use of digital cash, and provide a sudden infusion that will
&gt;&gt;&gt;promote other uses.  There's another advantage, however.  Since "Netizens"
&gt;&gt;&gt;are somewhat biased towards libertarianism, this will have the effect of
&gt;&gt;&gt;keeping more of this money "in the family" as it were, while at the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;time being open, technically, to everyone who can get on the 'net.
