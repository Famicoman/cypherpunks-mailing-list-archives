I am afraid that that is the solution to the wrong problem.  NTT's
problem is that they cannot sell the RSA chip in the United States
without a license from RSA Data under the RSA patent.  So the deal is
for RSA Data to be NTT's agent in the U.S.  But Bidzos was complaining
bitterly at the EPIC conference that the export regulations on crypto
had cost RSA Data the international market.  

The software for both DES and RSA are publically available so it would
not have solved any previously unsolved problem for someone to have
mailed the code--or the algorithms--to NTT.
