&gt; This isn't true. I don't believe in killfiles. Being on my twit list simply
&gt; means that you're entitled to a brief acknowledgement of every message you

How polite, like a Courtesy_Copy.    Thanks!

&gt; send me. Skippy was added after he sent me the 3MB results from the
&gt; rec.music.white-power vote as a rather limp mailbombing attempt (free clue:
&gt; it takes a lot more than that to make a dent in our bandwidth or disk
&gt; space); see <A  HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~llurch/potw2/rec.music.white-powder">http://www.stanford.edu/~llurch/potw2/rec.music.white-powder</A> for
&gt; that email. 

Liar.  Since they got rid of the old Bell, Stanford is as good as
Netcom in their top level functions, I retreived the above page in
a few seconds, it's the terminals and stuff which cause the problems.
You, for instance, only use Micro$oft, so you lose out on the use
of Stanford's T3's, which I use all the time whenever I'm logged in
to Netcom.  As if there's anybody stupid enough to use Micro$oft
for networking, much less Dial-ups!

&gt; &gt; somebody has placed a global cancel bot on

I was wrong, I was just Dicked a few forge-cancels.  He got angry
of course, when I added misc.test, which means he can't continue
to forge-cancel without quickly alerting me.

&gt; &gt; me.  I'm gonna have plenty of fun figuring
&gt; &gt; this out.  Kwow any good sniffers?
&gt; 
&gt; The one that used to be running on darth.stanford.edu was pretty good. 
&gt; Since February 22nd, I've working on the assumption that everything I do
&gt; unencrypted is public. I would revoke my PGP key, but I never used it much
&gt; for receiving mail anyway, and I'm not sure that it was found. 

You could explain to us what you are talking about,
but that would threaten your B1!?3 status.

&gt; &gt; I agree the list should be public usenet:
&gt; &gt; A mail gate-way to a usenet group that
&gt; &gt; ALSO permits unmoderated posts.  This
&gt; &gt; would be a nice way to combine a strict
&gt; &gt; moderated mail-list, with a standard 
&gt; &gt; netnews group.

Great idea.  For stormfront.
BTW, can you forge-request another archives for me?
I saw a couple of letters before losing the rest.
I'm trying to work novell dos with linux and making
a general mess of things.  Picked up an unwrapped
copy for $40, is that a good deal?

&gt; Gee, what a great idea! Why hasn't anyone thought of that? hks.net, for
&gt; example. Unfortunately, there are too many copyright terrorists here.

Never noticed it.

&gt; There's a tradeoff between freedom and visibility. As astute readers are
&gt; aware, hks.net had to take down the archives after WSJ made a threat that
&gt; was a little too credible.

Never noticed it.  You folks are just so damned paranoid.
The government's not out to get you, just help you.
