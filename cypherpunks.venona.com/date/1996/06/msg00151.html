&gt; political climate.  Having just read your post on curfews my response
&gt; was what the fuck, are you serious?  It totally amazes me that public
&gt; opinion has got to the stage that something like this would be
&gt; accepted.

Interesting that the day after you posted this the front-page of the UK's
major newspapers carried a story about the Labour party proposing
precisely the same thing in the UK. Of course the cops already have
surveillance cameras all over the place. 

&gt; I'm not sure where I would stand on this legally, but I have so far
&gt; resisted the temptation to tell them it's none of their business.

I tried it a few weeks ago when they stopped me for a random breath test
(illegal as far as I know) after following me for three miles while I
scrupulously obeyed the law. They originally claimed that they had stopped
me randomly, because "that's what I pay them for", but when I questioned
the legality they decided that I'd crossed the centerline while passing a
parked car and therefore must be drunk (even though my car was too wide to
not cross the line). In other words, I don't think they care about the
legal issues. Still, I suppose it's better than being stopped for "driving
at 2:30 in the morning" again. Hmm, who said the UK didn't have a curfew
already? 

&gt; They are I think
&gt; talking about making it law that all target pistols must be kept at
&gt; the gun club (whereas currently you can take them home to clean (but
&gt; not shoot)).

Gun-thieves will love that one. Why steal them one at a time when you can 
steal twenty or thirty in one go?
