&gt;If you mean myself, this had not occured to me and I assure you I have

&gt;his book.

No, Adam, I certainly was not implying you are profiting from this in any
way. Maybe the "make.money.fast" description was a poor one...what I meant
to imply is that the book is being advertised widely (I've seen half a
dozen announcements of it), and it reminds me of either the Craig Shergold
or make.money.fast posts, not sure which.

&gt;The writing style wasn't great, and I'd agree there were plenty of
&gt;flaws, but what I was interested in was cypherpunks opinions on the
&gt;technology, rather than the quality of the book, or making money for

The main technology, "the truth machine," is so bogus as to be boring.

&gt;The interesting technologies touched on were:
&gt;
&gt;- cheap video used by everyone to record their own lives

A better treatment of this is in David Brin's "Earth."

&gt;That government might have a go at mandating a "voluntary" video
&gt;survielance set up doesn't seem that unrealistic in the current
&gt;political climate.  Having just read your post on curfews my response
&gt;was what the fuck, are you serious?  It totally amazes me that public
&gt;opinion has got to the stage that something like this would be
&gt;accepted.  Sounds like a military dictatorship.  Children first,
&gt;adults next?  The level of peoples paranoia about reducing crime at
&gt;any cost has been severely underestimated.  Surely that's way out of
&gt;line constitutionally?

We agree. I once jokingly wrote a post about "position escrow," and I now
fear it is not so far off. ("The Positional Update Tracking Zoner (PUTZ)
meets law enforcement's legitimate needs, with proper court authority, to
track the movements of citizen-units.")

However, what you say below about being required to explain your movements
to cops who stop you on the highway and then present "papers" to them
within one week is truly horrifying, far beyond anything we yet have here
in these beknighted states:

&gt;For instance I have been stopped by the police four times late at
&gt;night driving home, as I live some distance from the university.  The
&gt;questions are basically what is your business (ie what are you doing
&gt;so late at night), and then they get you to take in your papers to the
&gt;police station within 1 week which is an inconvenience.  Also the
...

!!!

Glad I don't live in Britain.
