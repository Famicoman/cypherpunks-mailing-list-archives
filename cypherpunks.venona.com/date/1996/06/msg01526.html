(1) SENATE ENCRYPTION HEARING ILLUSTRATES SEA CHANGE IN POLICY DEBATE

On Wednesday June 26, 1996 the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science,
Space, and Technology held a hearing to consider legislation designed to
encourage the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use, privacy and
security technologies for the Internet.  Wednesday's hearing illustrated
that a sea change has occurred in Congressional attitude towards the
encryption policy debate.

While members of the Subcommittee noted the complex law enforcement issues
raised by the encryption policy debate, the Senators also recognized that
because of the global nature of the Internet, top down regulations such as
export controls and centralized government mandates like the Clipper
schemes will not address the needs of individuals, business, and even law
enforcement in the Information Age.

In addition, several Senators noted that future of electronic commerce,
privacy, and the competitiveness of the US computer industry should not be
held hostage to law enforcement considerations.

This change in Congressional attitude towards encryption policy is
significant and extremely encouraging.

Wednesday's hearing was also significant because it was the first ever
Congressional hearing cybercast live on the Internet. Details on the
Cybercast are attached below.

The hearing, chaired by Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), was called to consider
the Promotion Of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) legislation,
which would relax current regulations restricting the export of strong
encryption.

Witnesses testifying before the panel included:

* Phil Zimmermann, Inventor of PGP
* Whit Diffie, Sun Microsystems, Father of Public-Key Cryptography
* Phil Karn, Qualcomm Inc, Cryptographer
* Marc Rotenberg, Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center
* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Technology
* Matt Blaze, Lucent Technologies Cryptographer,
* Barbara Simons, Chair of US Public Policy Committee, ACM
* And 135 Netizens (<A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com">http://www.crypto.com</A>)

CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman also testified before the Subcommittee.
Noting that the current US encryption policy has left individual Internet
users without adequate privacy and businesses without necessary security,
Berman urged Congress to instead move forward to reform US policy based on
the following principals:

* THE INTERNET IS NOT LIKE A TELEPHONE SYSTEM: The traditional approach
  to wiretapping cannot simply be extended to the Internet. This new
  medium encompasses a range of social functions far beyond simple two-
  way voice communication.  These broad activities demand a heightened
  capacity for uses to protect their security and privacy online.

* THE INTERNET IS A GLOBAL, DECENTRALIZED MEDIUM: Efforts to impose
  unilateral national policies -- such as export controls or key escrow
  proposals -- are unlikely to be accepted widely.  Decentralized user
  choice solutions to privacy problems are preferable to and more
  effective than centralized, governmental mandates (such as the
  Clipper proposals).

* ON THE INTERNET, THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS A LOCAL ORDINANCE:
  Constitutional guarantees of privacy and free expression to U.S.
  Citizens whose communications regularly cross national borders.
  Policies should be designed to protect Americans outside the shelter
  of U.S. law.

Berman expressed CDT's strong support for Congressional efforts to reform
US Encryption policy, and urged Congress to act quickly to liberalize
export controls and provide American Internet users with the strong
security and privacy they so badly need.

Audio transcripts of the Hearing, copies of the prepared statements of the
witnesses, and other background information is available at CDT's
encryption policy web page: <A  HREF="http://www.cdt.org/crypto/">http://www.cdt.org/crypto/</A>

HEARING SHOWS NEW SENSE OF URGENCY AND FOCUS IN CONGRESS

The clearest example of the emerging frustration in Congress with the
current export restrictions came in an exchange between Senator John
Aschroft (R-MO) and Phil Karn, a cryptographer with Qualcomm and a
plaintiff in a case challenging the export restrictions:

Sen. Aschroft: So for all other countries, the world is the market, but
               for American companies, America is the only market and
               the rest of the world is off limits?

Karn:          You've got it.

Sen. Aschroft: Mr. Chairman, I think that's one of the reasons we need
               to look very carefully at the bill (Pro-CODE) we are
               looking at here today...

Sen. Aschroft: In all our discussions about whether it (cryptography) is
               good or bad, we ignore the fact that it's THERE, and it
               can be available to Americans by American companies, it
               cannot be available to anyone else by American companies,
               but it can be available around the world by a company in
               any other country.

This exchange, as well as strong statements in support of the Burns
Pro-CODE bill from Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), who made the unusual move of coming to
a Senate hearing, show that Congress is finally giving the need to reform
US encryption policy serious support.

A hearing of the full Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Senator Larry
Pressler (R-SD) is expected in mid July.  Representatives from the
Administration and Law Enforcement agencies are expected to testify.  CDT
is working with Senator Burns' and Senator Pressler to bring that hearing
live online.  Check CDT's "Congress and the Net" Web Page at

(2) FIRST EVER CYBERCAST OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARING SHOWS CONGRESS'
    GROWING DESIRE TO REACH OUT TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY

Wednesday's hearing was the first Congressional hearing to be cybercast
live on the Internet.  The cybercast, coordinated at the request of Senator
Burns by the Center for Democracy and Technology, HotWired, DIGEX, and the
Voters Telecommunications Watch, provided Netizens around the world with
the opportunity to be a part of the Congressional debate on an important
Internet policy issue.

By reaching out to the net.community and providing netizens with an
opportunity to participate in the hearing (Senator Burns asked several
questions posed by the online audience), the cybercast marked an historic
moment in the evolution of the net.community as a political force.

In addition to a live audio feed from the hearing, approximately 40
netizens participated in a simultaneous discussion of the hearing in a chat
area on HotWired.  A member of Senator Burns' staff also joined the
discussion from inside the hearing room, providing insights into the
proceedings, answering questions from the audience, and delivering audience
questions to Senator Burns.

The goal of the hearing cybercast, as well as other recent CDT sponsored
online discussions with members of Congress, is to bring the net.community
and Congress together on critical Internet policy issues in order to
encourage a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding.
CDT is pleased to have been a part of this historic event, and looks
forward to bringing the next Senate Encryption hearing tentatively set for
mid-July online.

Audio transcripts from the hearing are available at:
