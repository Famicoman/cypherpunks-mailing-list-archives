&gt;        (KPMG-PEAT-MARWICK-STUDY) American companies forecast huge growth in
&gt;        electronic commerce, but study uncovers concern about the impact of
&gt;        ambiguous state tax laws 
&gt;        
&gt;           Business Editors
&gt;        
&gt;        NOTE:  The following news release replaces 
&gt;               BW1109, which was upheld by KPMG Peat Marwick.    
&gt;               This revised version is for immediate release.
&gt;        
&gt;            NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 27, 1996--An overwhelming nine
&gt;        out of ten financial executives at American companies currently
&gt;        engaged in buying and selling goods or services over the Internet
&gt;        caution that government must clarify the associated state and local
&gt;        tax implications if this new method of doing business is to reach
&gt;        its full potential, according to a study conducted on behalf of KPMG
&gt;        Peat Marwick LLP.  
&gt;        
&gt;            "This study shows that electronic commerce is taking off,"  said
&gt;        Kent Johnson, National Partner-in-Charge of KPMG's Sales and
&gt;        Transactions Tax practice.  "But it also reveals the frustrations of
&gt;        corporate America as it tries to cope with the murky environment
&gt;        created by applying old tax laws to new ways of doing business."  
&gt;        
&gt;            Johnson continues: "Taxation of electronic commerce varies from
&gt;        state to state so determining what's taxable and who is responsible
&gt;        for paying those taxes becomes very complex."  
&gt;        
&gt;            Survey respondents appear to agree.  Almost seven out of ten
&gt;        respondents (67%) say that state and local tax laws governing
&gt;        electronic commerce are ambiguous, while more than half of those
&gt;        polled (51%) say that this ambiguity is already inhibiting their
&gt;        involvement in electronic commerce.  Furthermore, 50% say they are
&gt;        "not very"  or "not at all"  familiar with the sales and transaction
&gt;        tax implications -- twice as many as those who say that they are
&gt;        "very"  or "extremely"  familiar with the tax issues.  In fact, 20%
&gt;        of the financial executives surveyed do not know if their companies
&gt;        are even subject to sales and transactions taxes for the sale of
&gt;        products and services over the Internet.  
&gt;        
&gt;            Johnson says that these statistics are particularly distressing
&gt;        because several states and municipalities have already begun taxing
&gt;        certain Internet services.  
&gt;        
&gt;            "The huge growth potential of the Internet has undoubtedly
&gt;        caught the attention of state tax administrators who are eagerly
&gt;        looking for ways to apply existing tax laws and capture some of the
&gt;        revenue this business generates,"  said Michael H.  Lippman,
&gt;        National Partner-in-Charge of KPMG's State and Local Tax Technical
&gt;        Services.  "On the other hand, companies are saying that tax law, in
&gt;        its present form, cannot be applied to the new world of electronic
&gt;        commerce.  They are calling for, at the least, a rewrite of the
&gt;        statutes and many contend that the states should give electronic
&gt;        commerce time to develop before imposing taxes."  
&gt;        
&gt;            Companies' concerns about taxes, however, go beyond those
&gt;        related to the bottom line.  More than half of those surveyed (53 %)
&gt;        think taxing electronic commerce has the potential to become a
&gt;        significant threat to privacy.  Other specific areas of concern
&gt;        include: "the crafting of equitable laws from state to state and
&gt;        across industries" and "fear that state taxing authorities will take
&gt;        a very aggressive approach in determining whether a company is
&gt;        taxable in its state."  
&gt;        
&gt;            Said Johnson of KPMG's Sales and Transaction Tax Practice: "Even
&gt;        though companies are saying they're concerned about the impact of
&gt;        state and local taxes on electronic commerce, very few have been
&gt;        proactive in working with taxing authorities to help ensure
&gt;        equitable rules."  Nearly seven out of 10 companies (68%) say that
&gt;        they are "not very"  or "not at all"  involved with efforts to
&gt;        affect state and local tax policy, compared to only one in 10
&gt;        companies that are "very"  or "extremely involved."  However,
&gt;        exactly half of respondents (50%) claim they do intend to become
&gt;        involved in industry group discussions and debates in the future.  
&gt;        
&gt;            Looking at taxation of electronic commerce from an international
&gt;        perspective, Jeff Stein, National Partner-in-Charge of KPMG's
&gt;        International Services, notes that the impact of ambiguous tax laws
&gt;        on electronic commerce is even more heightened as companies expand
&gt;        their sales and operations overseas.  
&gt;        
&gt;            "Electronic commerce has the potential to fuel the engine for
&gt;        future growth of U.S.  exports,"  notes Stein.  "In fact, 83 percent
&gt;        of study participants believe that electronic commerce will be a
&gt;        major vehicle for U.S.  exports."  
&gt;        
&gt;            About one-third of companies believe that state and local taxes
&gt;        imposed on electronic commerce diminish their international
&gt;        competitiveness.  Indeed, some companies even said that that they
&gt;        would consider moving their Internet activities offshore to escape
&gt;        state and local taxes in the future.  But, KPMG cautions, such a
&gt;        move might not provide the anticipated tax haven because
&gt;        jurisdictions around the world are revenue-starved and will be just
&gt;        as aggressive as individual states in imposing taxes on companies
&gt;        engaged in electronic commerce.  
&gt;        
&gt;            "There are a great deal of unknowns when it comes to electronic
&gt;        versus traditional commerce.  We've been advising our clients to
&gt;        develop a multi-level, flexible approach that positions them for
&gt;        sudden changes in policies.  At the same time we'll continue to work
&gt;        with regulators to help clarify how current tax laws can be fairly
&gt;        applied to business in the 21st century,"  said Lippman.  
&gt;        
&gt;        Editor's note: The KPMG Study was executed by Clark, Martire &amp;
&gt;        Bartolomeo, Inc.  during June 1996.  Results of the study will be
&gt;        available through KPMG's State and Local Tax Practice World Wide Web

&gt;        software/business services/ advertising; communications; and
