&gt;                                         
&gt;        TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 12 (UPI) -- Gov. Lawton Chiles said Wednesday  
&gt;he has ordered Florida education officials to determine whether a 
&gt;university researcher jailed in a patent dispute should be freed. 
&gt;        Petr Taborsky, an undergraduate chemistry major who worked for $8.50  
&gt;an hour in a laboratory at the University of South Florida, was 
&gt;sentenced in January to 3 1/2 years in a maximum-security prison. 
&gt;        He had refused to sign over to the school a patent for a new way he  
&gt;discovered to use a substance similar to cat litter to purify water. 
&gt;        ``I don't know what he's doing in prison,'' said Harry Singletary,  
&gt;Florida's prisons chief. ``We need prison beds for violent offenders, 
&gt;for repeat offenders. I don't see him as anybody threatening the public 
&gt;safety.'' 
&gt;        Chiles' general counsel, Dexter Douglass, asked the Florida Board of  
&gt;Regents to look into the university's handling of what he called ``this 
&gt;bizarre case.'' 
&gt;        Douglass has also asked the state's attorney general to look into the  
&gt;prosecution of Taborsky, ``particularly the apparent use of state funds 
&gt;for private attorneys to push criminal penalties.'' 
&gt;        USF reportedly has spent more than $320,000 on the Taborsky case, in  
&gt;addition to the costs of staff attorneys. 
&gt;        Taborsky's legal problems stemmed from a testing contract USF signed  
&gt;in 1987 with Florida Progress Corp., a utility conglomerate. 
&gt;        The contract specified that Florida Progress would own all data and  
&gt;discoveries. But when Taborsky was hired to work on the project, he did 
&gt;not sign an employment contract forfeiting the right to profit in 
&gt;anything he might discover. 
&gt;        When he left school in 1988, Taborsky took two notebooks that USF  
&gt;ordered him to return. When he refused, university police charged him 
&gt;with theft. 
&gt;        Taborsky contended the data contained in the notebooks was from  
&gt;research he conducted separate from the Florida Progress project and 
&gt;that the utility showed no interest in it until he discovered the new 
&gt;water-purification method. 
&gt;        When a jury convicted him of theft in 1990, Taborsky was sentenced to  
&gt;a year's house arrest, 15 years' probation and ordered to make no 
&gt;further use of the data. 
&gt;        But he pursued a patent and in 1992 received the first of three for  
&gt;the process. USF lawyers argued that was a violation of his probation, 
&gt;and the court ordered Taborsky to sign over the patent to the 
&gt;university. 
&gt;        He refused, and was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison.  
&gt;        Taborsky began prison life five months ago and has been described as  
&gt;a model inmate. He served on a chain gang at first and by May was 
&gt;working at the institution's waste-water treatment plant creating 
&gt;computer programs to monitor the water. 
&gt;        Singletary said within a few days, he hopes Taborsky will be in a  
&gt;minimum-security work-release center closer to where his parents live. 
&gt;        ``I'm looking for the right place to put him until he can be  
&gt;considered for clemency or whatever else is being looked at,'' 
&gt;Singletary said. 
&gt;        But at least one member of the Board of Regents defended the way USF  
&gt;handled the Taborsky case. 
&gt;        ``It doesn't sound any different to me than a guy who steals books  
&gt;out of the library,'' said Regents Chairman James Heekin. 
&gt;        ``What's the big deal?'' he asked.  
&gt;
