&gt; &gt; So perhaps Tim over-simplified by saying that there were no limits on
&gt; &gt; what ordinary employees could do.  OTOH, it seems that Perry also
&gt; &gt; over-simplified by flatly stating that Tim's trades while an Intel
&gt; &gt; employee were "illegal".
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, I never said that Tim's trades were illegal -- indeed, I
&gt; never mentioned Tim except to say that following his advice didn't
&gt; seem like a particularly safe course to take. Second of all, I can't
&gt; comment on whether Tim's trades were within the letter of the law or
&gt; not. Indeed, it would be difficult even if one knew all the
&gt; circumstances since the definition of "material non-public
&gt; information" is so hard to pin down.

In response to Tim's message wherein he described trading in Intel
stock while an employee there, you wrote (in message
&lt;<A HREF="msg00119.html">199606031523.LAA05288@jekyll.piermont.com</A>&gt;):

&gt; &gt;                          Under the rules, if you have nonpublic
&gt; &gt; information, even if you are not a corporate officer, you are an
&gt; &gt; insider for purposes of "insider trading" and your trades are illegal.

Sorry if I misinterpreted this.


&gt; The point of all this was not that one shouldn't participate in the
&gt; employee payroll stock purchase plan. The point was that a random
&gt; person on the street who gets told a 'hot tip' is probably subject to
&gt; the insider trading laws, never mind that he wasn't an employee or
&gt; what is conventionally thought to be an "insider".

OK.  The only point I want to make is that thousands of us do this to
some extent every year and the risk apparently isn't terribly high.
Each person who works for a large corporation has *some* "non-public
information" which helps them decide whether to participate in the
stock purchase plan next year.  (Obviously if I think the company's
going to tank, I won't buy any more shares.)  I haven't seen anyone
attempt to define "material" but I'll concede that it's vague enough
to be dangerous to anyone whose trades are large enough to attract
attention.
