(1) JOIN SENATOR BURNS LIVE ONLINE =TONIGHT= at 10PM EDT: Preview Tomorrow's
    Hearing on "Pro-CODE" Encryption Bill

 --&gt; Visit <A  HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/">http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/</A> for details &lt;--

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will be on HotWired's WiredSide chat TONIGHT
(6/11) at 10pm EDT to discuss tomorrow's scheduled hearing on his
"Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996" ("Pro-CODE")
encryption bill.

Tonight's WiredSide chat is a great opportunity to join Senator Burns on
the eve of an important hearing to ask questions about encryption policy
and get a preview of what the Senator expects to occur at the hearing.

Senator Burns will chair the first of two scheduled hearings on his
"Pro-CODE" bill tomorrow at 9:30 EDT in Room 253 of the Russell Senate
Office Building.  The hearing will take place in the Commerce Subcommittee
on Science, Technology and Space.  This is the first Congressional hearing
in recent memory to discuss "pro-encryption" legislation that would relax
current restrictive encryption export controls.

Never before has the public had this much access to legislators without
geographical proximity.  Cheaper than teleconferencing, and more direct
and unfiltered than the traditional press, online chats allow the public
to directly question and hear the answers from members of Congress.

The online chat is at 10pm EDT (7pm PDT) TONIGHT (6/11). HotWired's
WiredSide chat is at:

     <A  HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/">http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/</A>

Tonight's forum is another in a series of planned events, and is part
of a broader project coordinated by CDT and the Voters Telecommunications
Watch (VTW) designed to encourage members of Congress to work with the
Net.community on vital Internet policy issues and to bring the Internet
Community into the debate about those issues.

Transcripts from previous online chats are available -- for transcript
information and details about upcoming events, please visit CDT's newest
Issues Page, "Congress and the Net":
