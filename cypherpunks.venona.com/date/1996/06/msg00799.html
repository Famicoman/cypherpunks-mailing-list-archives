As we expected - our Announcement-posting generated 
a number of lame Followups. Our Answers follow:

in LACC-Diggest Bill Unruh &lt;unruh@physics.ubc.ca&gt; wrote:

&gt;Actually if I were a "haker" I would be far more worried that this is actually
&gt;a FBI/CIA/NSA/... run site. It sure would be a convenient way to pick off
&gt;whole loads of self styled hackers and tie them in to ongoing investigations.
&gt;"nobody can find out who hides behind alpha.c2.org accounts"
&gt;or who hides behind alpha.c2.org

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER ANSWERS: Actually if you were a "haker", 
you should be worried REGARDLESS of who runs this List: 
FBI/CIA/Stasi agents can trivially create an alias like 
FBI@alpha.c2.org and SUBSCRIBE to this List. They would
know all Information that is available to the List-owner,
except the subscriber-list. But, the subscriber-list is
useless because of Anonymity.

Even if alpha.c2.org were an FBI run Site, its Users
must use Anonymous-remailers to access it. That
preserves their Privasy.

&gt;Remind anyone of the police department that anonymously announced a
&gt;resisters' seminar on how to make bombs so they could find out who to
&gt;watch?

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER ANSWERS: how can they find out who 
to watch if subscribers are Anonymous??

&gt;I don't have a C2 account, and don't really want to pay for one.
&gt;I trust someone will put the hackerpunks archives on the web so
&gt;the rest of us can read them.

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER ANSWERS: alpha.c2.org Accounts are FREE.

Ecafe Mixmaster Remailer wrote in cypherpunks:
&gt;There was a minor error in my earlier post. If someone were to notice a
&gt;node on the internet receiving a bag with L(In)=L(Posted) *before* any
&gt;other nodes on the internet, then one could guess that node had a user who
&gt;was the owner of Hackerpunks.

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER ANSWERS: There is a minor Error in 
your current Post.  L(In) &lt;&gt; L(Posted) because of prepended
Headers. For Protection, hackerpunks List receives some 
Junk-mail, automatically trashed, to create Noise.

HACKERPUNKS-OWNER _A_D_V_I_S_E_S_ Sameer Parekh and 
GhiO to add Code to their Alpha-remailer to insert 
Random-Size Header 'X-Random-Noise:' before Encryption 
of Messages sent to Users of alpha.c2.org Accounts.
Other Remailers are advised to change the Size of
these Header Lines.

HACKERPUNKS List-bot adds a Random-size Kookie to every
outgoing Message to preserve Privacy of Subscribers.
