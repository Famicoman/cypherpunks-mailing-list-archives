Damn, we've been found out.

I don't suppose anyone will notice the fact that although I've
helped with the preparation for the SAFE day, I won't actually be
attending the event.

Clearly, I don't want to get caught.

-Shabbir J. Safdar * Online Representative * Voters Telecomm. Watch (VTW)
 <A  HREF="http://www.vtw.org/">http://www.vtw.org/</A> * Defending Your Rights In Cyberspace

PS On a more serious note, I can't get testimony into the record for this
hearing if you don't send it to me.  Sooo...please either fill out the
form at <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/submit/">http://www.crypto.com/submit/</A> or if you find that format too
constraining, just send it to me in email.  I'll see what I can do to
make sure PGP signatures are reproduced intact in the Congressional Record.

Most everyone I know cannot simply jaunt off to D.C. for a day.  Why not
at least make your voice heard?

&gt;WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS VIOLATION OF OUR RIGHTS? EVER HERE THAT
&gt;IN THE US VOTES ARE supposed to be *****SECRET*****??? NO MORE!
&gt;
&gt;Why does the vtw cdt etc want to hand over your name to the us gov? Notice
&gt;how there's two events one on the east cost and the other on the west coast.
&gt;Why is that? So they can get more names!
&gt;
&gt;Read carefully:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;TELL CONGRESS WHY ENCRYPTION IS IMPORTANT TO YOU - ADD YOUR VOICE TO THE
&gt;&gt;CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Senator Burns, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and the other sponosors of the
&gt;&gt;Pro-CODE bill want to hear from the Net.community about why encryption is
&gt;&gt;important to privacy and security on the Internet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Please be sure to visit <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/">http://www.crypto.com/</A> and add your voice to the
&gt;&gt;debate over encryption policy on Capitol Hill.  Responses will be tabulated
&gt;&gt;and the results, along with selected statements, will be included in the
&gt;&gt;Congressional Record by Senator Conrad Burns.  The restults will also be
&gt;&gt;featured during the Security and Freedom through Encryption Forum (SAFE) on
&gt;&gt;July 1 (details on that event are attached below).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;To add your voice to the crypto debate in Congress, visit:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/submit/">http://www.crypto.com/submit/</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Right. Sure. And then they have a record of all the ppl interested in
&gt;cryptoprivacy (keep reading)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;ATTEND THE SAFE FORUM - JULY 1, 1996 STANFORD CALIFORNIA
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;On July 1, 1996, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley at Stanford
&gt;&gt;University, members of Congress, prominent computer industry leaders and
&gt;&gt;privacy advocates will meet to discuss the need to reform U.S. encryption
&gt;&gt;policy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The event is FREE and open to the public, but space is limited and is going
&gt;&gt;fast.  To find out more, and to reserve your free ticket, visit the SAFE
&gt;&gt;Forum Web Page at:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/safe/">http://www.crypto.com/safe/</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And sign up for a free trip to the roundup of people who want privacy. Coming
&gt;soon to a police state near you. WHY THE FUCK DO THEY NEED TO KNOW YOUR
&gt;NAME FOR THIS SHIT??? WHY IS NO ONE ASKING THIS???
&gt;
&gt;Look carefully at who's sponsoring this. Who are they, and where does
&gt;the money come from? Hint: three letters.
&gt;
&gt;Notice how they don't use PGP to sign the msg? Wonder why? What does PRZ
&gt;say about this?
&gt;
&gt;Is there anyone we trust involved who can answer for this?
