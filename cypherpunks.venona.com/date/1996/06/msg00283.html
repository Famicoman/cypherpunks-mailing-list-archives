&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think multiple remailers at the same site help anything.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Assume Alice, Bob, and Carol are on abc.com and Xenu, Yak, and Zut
&gt;&gt;are on xyz.com.  Remailing between Alice, Bob, and Carol doesn't
&gt;&gt;make appear to make much difference, but it does reduce the damage
&gt;&gt;if one of the remailer's keys is compromised.  On the other hand,
&gt;&gt;mail from Alice -&gt; Xenu -&gt; Bob -&gt; Yak -&gt; Carol -&gt; Zut adds traffic
&gt;&gt;to the system, and makes traffic analysis more difficult,
&gt;&gt;even if the Bad Guys are watching site abc.com and have stolen
&gt;&gt;Alice, Bob, and Carol's keys.
&gt;
&gt;Wait a minute.  More traffic should make analysis easier, since traffic
&gt;analysis is mostly statistical work on the source and destination (not
&gt;necessarily "from" and "to").  A bigger sample makes more reliable
&gt;results.
&gt;
&gt;For traffic analysis, I don't know *who* sent the message (it was,
&gt;after all, anonymized), but I do know a site which transmitted it and
&gt;one which received it, the time it was transmitted, and maybe its
&gt;size.  Multiply this times a whole bunch of messages, and I can infer
&gt;information about "common interests" between those sources and
&gt;destinations.
&gt;
&gt;The delays and mixing done by remailers make it harder by
&gt;disassociating the true sender from the true receiver.  If a remailer
&gt;were to ignore this step, the analyst can deduce from the two data
&gt;points
&gt;
&gt;    "message a, source A, destination RemailerX, time t, size s"
&gt;    "message b, source RemailerX, destination B, time t+0.001s, size s"
&gt;
&gt;that there's some connection between A and B.  The more such evidence,
&gt;the stronger the connection.  If the remailer does a good job with
&gt;the delays and shuffling, then it becomes difficult for the analyst
&gt;to match message a with message b, leaving him with what he already
&gt;knew (that A and RemailerX have a common interest, as to B and RemailerX,
&gt;but the interests may be wholly unrelated).
&gt;
&gt;Multiple remailers on the same machine increases the resolution of
&gt;the address information, at best, improving the analysts ability to
&gt;make connections.  The same traffic load going to a single remailer
&gt;at the site makes the analyst's job harder.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The other threat it helps with is that if XYZ.COM gets complaints
&gt;&gt;about that evil user Zut, she can kick her off (Bad Zut!)
&gt;&gt;and still leave Xenu and Yak alone; if the remailer service
&gt;&gt;were provided by the machine owner herself she might be directly liable.
&gt;
&gt;Hmm.  Nothing really stops the machine owner from creating a personal
&gt;anonymous account to run the remailer.  When someone complains, shut it
&gt;down and create a new one.  There isn't yet a law which requires that
&gt;the owner be able to identify the user.  This affords the same
&gt;protection that multiple users does.


The time correlation attack can be defeated by sending mail into the
remailer network with a period roughly equal to the propagation time of a
message through a chain. That way your messages correlate with absolutely
all receipts of all messages. That contains no information.
