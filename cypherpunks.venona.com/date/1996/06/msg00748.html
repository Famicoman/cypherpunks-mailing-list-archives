 &gt; Setting a micropayment enabled web browser to automatically grant approval to
 &gt; payments of $.02/action may seem reasonable, but it depends on what the vendor
 &gt; has decided constitues an action.  If somone charged $.02/nanosecond for
 &gt; retreiving shareware from an FTP library, and my browser was set to accept this
 &gt; as reasonable based on the fact that it was $.02/action,

You could also set a per-site limit, or a per-minute limit.

 &gt; It took the industry long enough to get PCs and workstations to the
 &gt; speeds they're at today so people could do their own work on their
 &gt; own machines to go back to waiting in a queue for time on a
 &gt; centralized system so you can have the honor of paying someone a
 &gt; lot of money to run your job.  As a programmer, I can see how I
 &gt; could make a fat chunk of change by bilking people through metered
 &gt; software usage, but as a software consumer it seems like a rotten
 &gt; idea.

Oh?  Would you rather pay $5,000 for some vertical piece of software,
or license its use on a $1/hour basis?  Even if you used it every hour
of every workday, that's only $2,000.

 &gt; Looking at micropayments from the (economically) conservative element
 &gt; viewpoint within certain industries make them seem a lot less appealing, as
 &gt; well.  Take television.  If people had to purchase every TV show they
 &gt; watched, there would be a lot less TV production going on because there
 &gt; wouldn't be as much random TV watching.

Um, you *do* purchase every TV show.  On the fly.  30 seconds at a
time.  Of course, some cheap people try to welsh [ see my hostname
before taking offense ] on their payments by Going To The Bathroom
during their payment periods!  Disgraceful, just disgraceful.

 &gt; Both micropayments and data mining require that the user give the vendor a
 &gt; level of trust which most vendors are not willing to repay with similar
 &gt; trust and customer satisfaction.  Customer-users are expected to give
 &gt; vendors greater access to and control over their money and personal
 &gt; information, yet at best they can expect the same poor customer service and
 &gt; bureaucratic attitudes encountered when dealing with traditional
 &gt; transaction processing companies and at worst can expect to be swindled out
 &gt; of piles of money and/or have their
 &gt; privacy violated as a matter of course.

Hmmm...  Sounds like a job for ...  Super-Shameer!  Profit-making
super hacker privacy protector!  His mail flies through remailers with
the greatest of ease, he's invincible to flames, and and he is cute,
too!
