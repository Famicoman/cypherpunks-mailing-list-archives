Has anyone seen this yet?  Looks like it's two weeks old.  Internet Police!

&gt;[BizWire]    5/20/96
&gt;
&gt;        (SUN/PSI-INTL)(SUNW) PSI International, Sun partner, unveils Java-
&gt;        based Internet solution for law enforcement agencies; "Internet in
&gt;        Blue" Police Internet/Intranet Application Suite Available in July
&gt;        1996 
&gt;        
&gt;          Business Editors/Computer Writers
&gt;        
&gt;        Highlights:
&gt;            -- Internet in Blue, one of the first Java-based solutions aimed
&gt;        at fighting crime, is being introduced by PSI International, a
&gt;        strategic partner of Sun Microsystems Federal, and includes other
&gt;        Sun products.  
&gt;        
&gt;            -- Internet in Blue combines the power of Java and Netra servers
&gt;        to enable law enforcement agencies and police departments to quickly
&gt;        leverage the capabilities of the Internet and intranets.  
&gt;        
&gt;            -- This solution is the latest evidence of Sun taking advantage
&gt;        of the significant market opportunity for crime prevention
&gt;        technology.  Last year, Sun Federal announced a dedicated Criminal
&gt;        Justice Operation, which is working with police departments and law
&gt;        enforcement agencies around the world to help them use technology in
&gt;        fighting crime.  
&gt;        
&gt;            MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- May 20, 1996--One of
&gt;        the first Sun(TM) Java(TM)-based solutions aimed at fighting crime
&gt;        was introduced today by PSI International, a strategic partner of
&gt;        Sun Microsystems Federal, a subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, Inc.  
&gt;        
&gt;            Called Internet in Blue(TM), the solution combines the power of
&gt;        Sun's Java technology, its Netra(TM) Internet servers, its Java
&gt;        WorkShop(TM) development tools, and PSI's relational database
&gt;        software. This solution fully leverages the capabilities of the
&gt;        Internet for the benefit of law enforcement agencies because of the
&gt;        inclusion of Java, the revolutionary Internet platform from Sun that
&gt;        makes possible fast, easy, operating-system-independent use of the
&gt;        Internet.  
&gt;        
&gt;            To be offered by PSI, Internet in Blue will enable police
&gt;        departments and other law enforcement agencies to leverage the
&gt;        latest Internet technology to fight crime and promote citizen
&gt;        involvement and community-based policing.  From a citizen's
&gt;        perspective, having a local police force with an Internet presence
&gt;        gives people the opportunity to report problems online and play a
&gt;        more active role in fighting crime in their neighborhoods.  
&gt;        
&gt;            Besides utilizing the Internet, the PSI solution also allows
&gt;        local police to build an "intranet," which is a greatly enhanced
&gt;        internal information network to handle departmental processes as
&gt;        well as to speedily access any internal database of interest.
&gt;        Examples of these databases include local crime data such as
&gt;        patterns of crimes, gang affiliations, data on previous suspects and
&gt;        arrests.  Currently, many police departments must locate such data
&gt;        via a paper trail, which is very inefficient.  
&gt;        
&gt;            "Law enforcement agencies are quickly realizing the power of the
&gt;        Internet and intranets as strategic tools in fighting crime," said
&gt;        John Marselle, president of Sun Microsystems Federal.  "The Internet
&gt;        in Blue solution from PSI -- based on Sun technology -- takes
&gt;        advantage of Java's security features, platform independence and
&gt;        database access capabilities.  It should make it much easier for
&gt;        police departments and other criminal justice organizations to get
&gt;        online and to leverage the capabilities of the network."  
&gt;        
&gt;            With Java WorkShop, a visual development environment for Java
&gt;        that can be included as part of the Internet in Blue solution,
&gt;        police departments can design, test, deploy and maintain Internet
&gt;        and intranet applications based on Java with speed and simplicity.
&gt;        Java WorkShop runs on the Sun Solaris(TM) environment and Windows
&gt;        95/NT.  Using Java, the PSIBase relational database management
&gt;        system can access Web browsers across any hardware platform.  
&gt;        
&gt;            "The Internet is the next frontier in the development of law
&gt;        enforcement information systems," said Paul Wormeli, program
&gt;        director for law enforcement at PSI.  "Our Internet in Blue solution
&gt;        will enable law enforcement agencies to quickly exploit the latest
&gt;        technologies like Java."  
&gt;        
&gt;        Internet in Blue includes the following:
&gt;        
&gt;            A starter kit with a Sun Netra Internet server and PSI software
&gt;        and services needed to set up a site on the World Wide Web, as well
&gt;        as technical assistance from PSI for developing content and training
&gt;        for a Webmaster.  
&gt;        
&gt;            A full set of applications to create a police intranet providing
&gt;        secure internal access to selected crime information, standard
&gt;        operating police procedures and other infrastructure services.  
&gt;        
&gt;            An interactive, community-based communications medium to
&gt;        facilitate crime reporting over the Internet and community-based
&gt;        policing.  
&gt;        
&gt;            Suggestions for services that law enforcement agencies can
&gt;        develop in order to offset the cost of the Internet project, such as
&gt;        providing online crime reports and accident report information to
&gt;        authorized outside organizations including legal firms and insurance
&gt;        companies.  -0-
&gt;        
&gt;            The Internet in Blue product will be available in July, 1996.
&gt;        Pricing will vary depending on customer needs.
