&gt; I personally despise the term "nerd," but I won't get into that here.
&gt; (Except to say that "nerds," "geeks," and "dweebs" are terms of insult, and
&gt; anyone who accepts this labelling by the media and by "jerks" (a comparable
&gt; term, by the way) is proably just a dweeb anyone, so I guess the term is
&gt; accurate.)

I just caught this show last night.  And enjoyed it.  I 
personally thought that Steve Jobs quoting Picasso with the "True 
artists steal" line in regards to copying others work for personal 
gain was interesting. 

Since I live 10 blocks away from the main MS Campus, I hear 
everything there is to hear about Bill Gates.  So, it was really 
unnecessary for me to watch the hour and a hlaf devoted strictly to 
who Bill stole what from.  **GRIN**
 
&gt; Those were exciting times. But, having worked at Intel during those heady
&gt; days, and being pretty active these days on the Net, I'd have to say the
&gt; Web, Net, Java, etc. are *just as exciting* (if not more so) than those
&gt; days. So, the best years are probably yet to come.

Having started my "prefessional" Internet career at SPRY in 1993, I 
agree that the best of the Internet is yet to come.  Bill Gates said 
in the show last night that it is almost impossible to judge where 
the market will be in a year because things are changing so fast.  
Right now everything is a buzzword.  JAVA, etc...they are all infant 
technologies that if marketed correctly could lead to the next 
revolution.

&gt; (BTW, I also had an ARPANET account in 1973, when there were only several
&gt; sites as nodes.)

I was 2 until August of 1973.   **GRIN**  I didn't even know that the 
pictures on the TV weren't real yet.

&gt; So, a pretty fair history of the industry. Probably the best such show I've
&gt; seen.

I do wish they'd picked a better title though.

Brad
