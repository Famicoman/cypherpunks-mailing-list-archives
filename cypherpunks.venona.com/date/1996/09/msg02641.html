Preface

Rudolf ScholtenFederal Minister of Science, Transport and the Arts

The diffusion of telework is among the central phenomena characterizing the
contemporary technical and economic developments at a global state.
Faced with the restructuring of labour-markets and work, and witnessing the
rapidity of innovation within the information society it is the task of the
responsible analyst to consider the social impact of telework detached from
either technological euphoria  or resigned cultural pessimism.
In parallel to the growth of a worldwide net and the trends toward the
liberalisation of the telecom-markets the promotion of telework provides us
with seductive visions: Among others there is the promise to harmonize
classical antagonisms like those between urban and the rural areas or between
work and leisure-time. Accordingly teleworkers may expect a sheltered life in
the idyl of the village environment or the fond of the family whilst being
mobile beyond national borders at the same time. There is the assumption that
women in particular will no longer be threatened by breaks of their
professional careers. Companies are expected to increase profits due to
increased productivity and organisational innovation. Positive effects on the
labour-market and the natural environment are likewise foreseen.
No doubt telework bears chances for the future. Nevertheless, we should not
forget to take possible disadvantages  into account: For example, the
mingling of work and private sphere, relevant for mere homebased work, can be
a factor of increased individual mental stress. The creation of new patterns
of work might be connected with the loss of old types of jobs. Tendencies
toward individualisation and the decline of social solidarity might be
intensified. Issues like labour legislation and the threatening decrease of
social security urgently need to be discussed.
If we were to describe the situation as an open game of chances and risks, a
demand for creative policies to shape our future prospects positively and
consciously gains evidence.
This demand shall be met by "Telework 96": The exchange of experiences
between science and policy-makers, industry and trade unions is organized not
only in order to analyse the present situation, but also with a view of
preparing solutions for the near future.
"Working in a Wider Europe" may be read in a twofold way: as referring to an
extension of individual life perspectives as well as a metaphor for the
promotion of the process of the European integration, whereby the countries
of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) will be of particular interest.
The use of advanced technology and traditional ways of decision-making can
not be mentioned without referring to mechanisms of exclusion. In contrast,
within and around "Telework 96" a wide range of events are organized for
adressing various types of institutions and groups of special interest,
including pupils, female workers, and persons in search of employment.

Rudolf Scholten

---------------------------------------------------------------

About the Assembly

Focus: European integration, particularly Central and Eastern Europe;
transnational standards for telework
Main topics: Getting people to work; Training for life in the Information
Society; Working towards sustainability
Format: Scientific conference &amp; political assembly &amp; exhibition of
applications and cases
Participants: Leading international experts, practitioners, scientists,
politicians, representatives from business, trade unions and public
administration and NGO's

Telework 96 provides the largest and most comprehensive platform to both
observe and promote progress of teleworking in Europe. It is the lead event
of the European Telework Week 1996 (ETW 96), which is held under the auspices
of the European Commission (DG XIII) from November 4-11, 1996. It is called
an "assembly" because of its composition comprising elements of a scientific
conference with political debates and of a business exhibition as well.

Companies, regional councils, telework pilots (e.g. tele-cottages) and other
institutions are invited to participate in an exhibition which is open to the
public. Conference meetings in plenaries and parallel sessions are open to
experts and representatives of basicly five major societal players in the
field:

(1) Employers (companies, associations of industrialists, Chambers of
Commerce)

(2) Employees (Trade Unions, Shop Stewards, Chambers of Labour, associations
of teleworkers)

(3) Politics (from communal, regional, national to European and transnational
level, particularly the Inter-Parliamentary Special Interest Group)

(4) Science (experts and analysts of many kinds, consultants and researchers
from private and public research centres, universities and international
institutions)

(5) NGO's (e.g. environmentalist groupings, women's organisations, youth
groups).
Public administration on municipal, regional, federal or European level of
course also plays a role which may e.g. in one case appear in the area of
politics or in another in that of the employers.

In the overall format speakers of the assembly are selected and invited
representatives of these groups. Participants of course will represent an
even wider spectrum and will have in many regards concurrent and additional
knowledge and experience in the themes the assembly deals with. Hence methods
and procedures will be imposed to prevent the assembly from becoming a sort
of closed shop where experts, known to each other quite well, tell experts
what is the experts expertise.

Instruments in this regard are:

+       Careful selection of speakers in the opening event (Monday evening), the
plenaries and the parallel track sessions both on Tuesday and Wednesday.

+       Offering an "Open Forum (OF)" concerning the three main topics (track 1:
Work, track 2: Training; track 3: Sustainability). This allows interested
observers and participants  to send in abstracts and posters about their work
(be it in research, teleworking pilots, publishing etc.). These contributions
will be taken care of by the scientific organizers in the following way:
        Besides the abstracts of the invited lectures contributions to the
OF will
be listed in the Preceedings; in each of the track sessions a discussion will
be held on how to best publish and further proceed with these pools of
knowledge; the "posters" will be exhibited, and the abstracts of written
contributions will be distributed during the assembly; publication will be
offered on the web (Telework 96 homepage) and a selection of the most
relevant contributions will be printed after the event as "Proceedings 2"
apart from the lectures of invited speakers ("Proceedings 1").

+       The invention of a "Worker's Tele-Corner": A dedicated workplace in the
conference area is connected to a server, bearing all the information brought
in through the OF, allowing interested people from around the globe to share
information on their teleworking experiences, needs and maybe marketable
results. Further to that there will be links not only to the Telework 96 and
ECTF homepages, but also to the ETW website <A  HREF="http://www.eto.org.uk">http://www.eto.org.uk</A> (e-mail:
etw96-info@eto.org.uk), ACTS and Telematics projects networks, and various
databanks (building up an "electronic environment" of Telework 96).

+       Teleconferencing between the major events within the assembly and other
European conferences operated within the European Telework Week.

+       Arranging "additional events" in Vienna, stimulated by Telework 96 and
being also integrated in the framework of the European Telework Week.

+       Allowing manyfold concertation meetings among telework oriented European
research and development projects.

Programme Monday, November 4, 1996

08.00 Registration
09.00 - 17.00 Concertation meetings of European projects on teleworking:

 1) ACTS-Concertation Meeting of the GA Telework Chain, involving
particularly DIPLOMAT (ACTS 10095, "The European Charter for Telework") and
ETD (ACTS 10081, "European Telework Development"). Partners/representatives
of other ACTS projects related to telework are invited to participate.

 2) Telematics programme, particularly telework oriented TURA-projects
("Telematics for Urban and Rural Areas") will be invited to participate in a
"trans-programme" communication to exchange experiences and further
exploitation of results across the programmes.

 3) Established contacts to DG V and the European Foundation for the
Improvement of Living and Working Conditions will lead to their presence in
this meeting too; transfer of knowledge is enhanced among the DG's involved
and projects started within the Community Initiatives (ADAPT, EMPLOYMENT).
Particularly the High Level Expert Group of DG V ("Flynn Commission") is
invited to participate.

Meeting rooms and communication facilities are available to be arranged
according to demand. The City of Vienna offers technical assistance to this
meeting as well as regarding "Telework 96", because the municipality of
Vienna itself participates in several European projects and took on the
"Bangemann Challenge". Thus the informatics department will use the Telework
Assembly  as a demonstrator of its ability of networking and building an
electronic environment for the conference. This will apply also to some of
the additional events which will take place during the ETW, and secure
permanence of information and communication technologies implementation
(teleworking facilities) set up to enhance the success of Telework 96 and
further achievements of the European Telework Week.
