	I thought it was interesting to note what got deleted - namely
cryptographic (signature) protection against such attacks - and what got
included - namely faked addresses. You can get the original NYT version via
JYA.

&gt;            CONCERN AT RASH OF ATTACKS BY HACKERS ON INTERNET SITES
&gt;   __________________________________________________________________________

&gt;   SAN FRANCISCO (Sep 19, 1996 00:23 a.m. EDT) -- A rash of hacker
&gt;   attacks on commercial Internet sites -- including one in which the
&gt;   services of Panix, a New York-based Internet access provider, were
&gt;   seriously disrupted -- has raised new concerns about the security and
&gt;   reliability of the worldwide computer network.
   
[...]

&gt;   Attacks have been "isolated incidents," said Pete Solvik,
&gt;   vice-president of information systems at Cisco Systems, the leading
&gt;   manufacturer of routing equipment for the Internet. The company,
&gt;   however, is concerned that the problem could spread, disrupting
&gt;   Internet service for millions of users and effectively closing down
&gt;   large commercial sites on the Internet.
   
&gt;   With many banks and retailers now planning Internet services, the
&gt;   potential for financial losses as a result of such attacks is rising.
&gt;   Disruption of Internet service can also be a serious problem for the
&gt;   tens of thousands of businesses that now rely on electronic mail and
&gt;   sites on the World Wide Web to communicate with their partners and
&gt;   customers.
   
&gt;   The impact of a large-scale "denial-of-service attack" can be
&gt;   devastating, said Solvik. Within a minute, a computer linked to the
&gt;   Internet can be completely overwhelmed and it may take days before
&gt;   service can be restored.
   
[...]

&gt;   Because the attacks came from fake addresses on the Internet, it was
&gt;   "impossible to trace the source without a major effort on the part of
&gt;   all Internet service providers between Panix and the attacking party,"
&gt;   said Rosen.
   
&gt;   "The nature of the Internet, which is designed to let machines
&gt;   communicate with a minimum exchange of identifying information, makes
&gt;   every site on the Internet vulnerable," said Rosen.
   
&gt;   The Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York Computer Investigations
&gt;   Threat Assessment Center is understood to be investigating the attack
&gt;   on Panix. Computer Emergency Response Teams, a US organization that
&gt;   collates information about security and technical problems on the
&gt;   Internet, are looking into the incident.
