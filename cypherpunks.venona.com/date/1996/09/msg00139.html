Of course, whites never commit other crimes, are never on the 
proscribed categories, and people of colour never carry guns or are
never free of being classified as being in the proscribed categories.  You
sound like Skippy making fun of the McClatchy newspapers.

What?  Are you talking about lockbacks?  An actual switchblade is a
felony to *possess* in California.

! harasss someone. Interestingly, it was the District Attorneys lobbying

I'm familiar with the anti-racist pandering of the gun rights majority.
The weapons mentioned above were banned later this century in 
California, ostensibly to protect minors.  There has always been cheap
firearms available to poor people in America, I'm not aware that only
coloured people can be poor!  It's been a step by step process to take
away rights, it's been entirely irrelevent what the laws were supposedly
for.  It is not believable that all whites are rich or that poor whites
in prison are treated with greater respect than rich people of colour or
poor people of colour.  There's been *both* racist and anti-racist
elements to the progress of unjust laws, the original intent of the law
itself is forgotten if the current law only respects people of capital.
