&gt;&gt; &gt;Often the choice faced by the investor who has material non-public
&gt;&gt; &gt;information is characterized as "disclose or abstain," meaning that the
&gt;&gt; &gt;investor may either trade after disclosing or abstain from trading on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;information.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;A few people have asked me what constitutes disclosure.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I've not researched the latest cases, but the generally accepted "best
&gt;&gt; &gt;description" can be found in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulpher Co., 401 F.2d 833
&gt;&gt; &gt;(2d Cir.1968), cert. denied.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The reading of a news release, which promoted Coates into
&gt;&gt; &gt;action, is merely the first step in the process of dissemination required
&gt;&gt; &gt;for compliance with the regulatory objective of providing all investors
&gt;&gt; &gt;with an equal opportuinity to make informed investment judgements.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Assuming that the contents of the official release could have been
&gt;&gt; &gt;instantaneously be acted upon, at the minimum Coates should have waited
&gt;&gt; &gt;until the news could reasonably have been expcted to appear over the media
&gt;&gt; &gt;of widest circulation, the Dow Jones broad tape, rather than hastening to
&gt;&gt; &gt;insure an advantage to himself and his broker son-in-law.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It would seem to me that if I operated an open listserver, upon which
&gt;&gt; financial information regularly appeared and which any trader (serious or
&gt;&gt; otherwise) might subscribe, my information should be held in the same legal
&gt;&gt; regard as DJ.
&gt;
&gt;I disagree.  If the information appears only on your listserver it will
&gt;not, in my view, be considered released.  You'll note above that the
&gt;reading of a news release, which eventually propogated to Canada and New
&gt;York, still was not enough to limit liability for Coates.  I hardly think
&gt;a small circulation electronic mailing list will be considered sufficent
&gt;either.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If not, the SEC has in effect created a monopoly for
&gt;&gt; Dow-Jones and its ilk and effectively impede or excluded other news sources
&gt;&gt; (e.g., Internet feeds) as legit means for generating market awareness, and
&gt;&gt; therefore revenue.
&gt;
&gt;Correct.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I and many others occassionally trade on public
&gt;&gt; information from narrower sources than DJ (e.g., market newsletters).
&gt;
&gt;But you and others are (I hope) not insiders or direct tipees.
&gt;You also note that you trade on "public information."  So long as you keep
&gt;it that way you should be alright.
&gt;
&gt;You will be putting yourself in a interesting position if material
&gt;non-public information ever shows up on your newsletter and is later the
&gt;subject of investigation.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sometimes DJ and others pick up info from these sources and sometimes they
&gt;&gt; don't (or not immediately).  Does that mean those trading on this data
&gt;&gt; published not yet picked up by DJ may be trading illegally?  If so, this is
&gt;&gt; totally unjust and wrongheaded.
&gt;
&gt;The case mans what it says.  Until the information reaches the sources of
&gt;largest distribution it is still "non-public."  What is a source of
&gt;largest distrubution?  Ask a judge.  I would simply be careful and
&gt;prudent.  You could easily be in trouble for trading on information which
&gt;you "knew or should have known was material, non-public information."
&gt;
&gt;There is, of course, a distinction between the trader who reads an article
&gt;and trades on it and a trader who hears over a mailing list from a
&gt;corporate insider that a major fraud in the company has been discovered.
&gt;
&gt;If your newsletter carries hints of the big merger before it happens and a
&gt;trader later points to it as the source of his tip, you could be in
&gt;serious trouble.  God forbid they get it in your head that you are
&gt;distributing inside information.  Of course you can imagine the headlines.
&gt;
&gt;"Internet crime network foiled.  Hundreds of subscribers capitalize on
&gt;inside information."
&gt;
&gt;As for unjust and wrongheaded, welcome to the American concept of
&gt;securities regulation.
