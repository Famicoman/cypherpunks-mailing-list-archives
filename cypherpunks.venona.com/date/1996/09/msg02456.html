Last week I started a thread on the Telecom Regulation list.  My intention
was to introduce discussion of some circe-1780s Republican questioning, as
opposed to the widely accepted Federalist.  The most interesting composite
result is below:

&gt;
&gt; &gt;I've been wondering lately about the jurisdictional limits of the FCC
&gt; &gt;vis-a-vis the Article(s) of the Constitution from which they derive their
&gt; &gt;authority.  My understanding is that the FCC is empowered under the Fed's
&gt; &gt;interstate commerce clauses.  If so, how valid is their jurisdiction over
&gt; &gt;low power and/or millimeter wave transmissions.  It seems a case can be
&gt; &gt;made that such transmissions represent little or no possibility of
&gt; &gt;interstate transmission.
&gt;
&gt;To which Bob Jacobson &lt;bob@worldesign.com&gt; replied:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The FCC derives its authority by Congressional mandate, so the question is
&gt; &gt;rightly posed as "Does Congress have rights to regulate local radio trans-
&gt; &gt;missions?"  Congress abrocated to itself the right to regulate all radio
&gt; &gt;transmissions, on the grounds that any transmission might interfere with
&gt; &gt;the transmissions of interstate broadcasters.  Generally, this right has
&gt; &gt;been upheld by the courts, although states have successfully challenged
&gt; &gt;the absolute power of the FCC with regard to certain aspects of non-radio
&gt; &gt;transmissions -- for example, telephone calls -- that do not cross state
&gt; &gt;boundaries and even some that do.  To my knowledge, no form of electronic
&gt; &gt;transmission is invulnerable to some type of regulation, whether federal
&gt; &gt;or state (including municipal regulation by cities and counties, creatures
&gt; &gt;of the states).  Of course, there are loopholes, as the Internet has amply
&gt; &gt;demonstrated.
&gt;
&gt;In further response, John Levin &lt;jlevin@paonline.com&gt; added:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;This discussion is incorrect by omission. The reason that states have
&gt; &gt;authority over intrastate telephone service is because Congress says they
&gt; &gt;do. The Telecommunications Acts carve out areas of state and federal
&gt; &gt;jurisdiction.  The FCC, like any other agency, takes an expansive view of
&gt; &gt;their authority and courts occasionally rein in such excursions after
&gt; &gt;looking at their enabling statutes.  The technical doctrine is 'federal
&gt; &gt;preemption', and unless Congress expressly preempts the states, or the
&gt; &gt;preemption is necessary to effectuate a national policy authorized by
&gt; &gt;federal legislation, the states retain control of state activities.  As to
&gt; &gt;what constitutes 'interstate commerce' for the purposes of the U.S.
&gt; &gt;Constitution, there are hundreds, if not thousands of court decisions on
&gt; &gt;that topic.  During most of this century, usually even a very slight
&gt; &gt;impact on interstate commerce has been found to be sufficient for Congress
&gt; &gt;to legislate.  Those of you who plan on using 'states rights' as a basis
&gt; &gt;for disobeying Federal laws or regulations should consult an attorney and
&gt; &gt;get your affairs in order before you act.
&gt;
&gt;Although nothing in the Communications Act of 1934 or it predecessor Radio
&gt;Acts states so explictly, it is implicit that the Interstate Commerce Clause
&gt;is the basis for the statute and for FCC radio licensing jurisdiction.  That
&gt;was undoubtedly one of the bases for earlier legislative and Commerce
&gt;Department regulation of radio, along with providing for the national
&gt;defense.  Under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause,
&gt;Congress can assert jurisdiction over virtually anything affecting
&gt;interstate commerce.  This clearly underlies Section 301 of the
&gt;Communications Act, which asserts federal jurisdiction and control over all
&gt;interstate radio transmissions and requires FCC licensing for the same.
&gt;
&gt;The Communications Act does not assert jurisdiction over, or require FCC
&gt;licenses for, radio transmissions between two points in a single state (not
&gt;including D.C.).  In fact, this doesn't remove virtually anything from
&gt;federal jurisdiction or licensing as a matter of law, because radio
&gt;transmissions don't stop at any particular point, they merely attenuate as
&gt;they continue to propagate onward ad infinitum.  As a technical matter, a
&gt;milliwatt-level millimeter-wave radio transmission from one end of a
&gt;steel-encased underground chamber to a receiver at the other end propagates
&gt;to points thousands of miles away, albeit at an undetectible level (i.e.,
&gt;waaaaay below the noise floor), and it therefore could be viewed as an
&gt;interstate radio transmission.  Practically, however, such transmissions
&gt;stop at the steel shielding.  The FCC, therefore, will be unable to document
&gt;that there was an interstate radio transmission and would likely be unable
&gt;to shut you down.
&gt;
&gt;The FCC has adopted rules that permit unlicensed operation under common
&gt;circumstances when there is unlikely to be any interstate effects.  Part 15
&gt;sets forth power levels and other transmission parameters for certain
&gt;frequency bands that do not require licensing.  Although the jurisdictional
&gt;basis for Part 15 has never been expressly stated, the FCC views such
&gt;transmissions as not, in any practical sense, likely to interfere with
&gt;licensed transmissions, and the unlicense use of spectrum is conditioned on
&gt;not interfering.
&gt;
&gt;One could argue that other low-power or physically confined radio
&gt;transmissions are also unlikely to cross state lines as a practical matter,
&gt;or to interfere with licensed transmissions, and are therefore beyond the
&gt;FCC's jurisdiction.  The FCC has not conceded its jurisdiction in such
&gt;cases, however.  There is currently litigation ongoing regarding a
&gt;California (Berkeley, perhaps?) low-power FM station that did not obtain a
&gt;license.  It doesn't interfere, and it can't be received out-of-state.  Can
&gt;the FCC shut it down?  Yet to be decided.
&gt;
&gt;Steve Schear also wrote:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Another question has to do with spectrum ownership.  Prior to the '34 Act
&gt; &gt;who owned the spectrum.  Was any compensation made for the taking?
&gt;
&gt;To which Bob Jacobsen replied:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;As to ownership of the spectrum, the spectrum still is owned by the people
&gt; &gt;of the United States, held in public trust.  So-called "sales" of spectrum
&gt; &gt;are actually licenses to use various frequencies under different rules.
&gt; &gt;Presumably Congress has the right to sell this "property" in the same way
&gt; &gt;that it sells forests on public lands, but so far it has not done so.  On
&gt; &gt;the other hand, the federal government has exacted remarkable fees for
&gt; &gt;certain licenses:  PCS operators have already put up over $17 billion in
&gt; &gt;fees for licenses auctioned by the FCC!
&gt;
&gt;Actually, spectrum isn't "owned" by anyone, including the people of the
&gt;United States.  One can't own a physical dimension such as frequency, any
&gt;more than distances, speeds, or colors.  The federal government has asserted
&gt;*control* over the *use* of spectrum, however, just as it and the states
&gt;assert control over the use of particular speeds in particular locations
&gt;(e.g., 55 or 65 mph on freeways).  As Bob said, the right to use spectrum,
&gt;within specifically defined geographic, frequency, power, and time limits,
&gt;is conferred by licenses awarded by the FCC.  These licenses, for a
&gt;specified term, are sometimes given away to the first person who asks for
&gt;them, sometimes awarded by hearing or lottery, or, more recently, sometimes
&gt;awarded on the basis of the highest bid.  The FCC isn't selling spectrum per
&gt;se, but a license for the exclusive right to use particular spectrum under
&gt;the defined terms of the license.  This is very different from selling
&gt;public land, but is somewhat like selling the right to harvest the trees (or
&gt;mine the coal, or drill and pump the oil) from a piece of federal land for a
&gt;certain number of years.
