&gt;My conclusion is simple: Tell people if they don't work, they won't eat. If

I've noticed that many places are concerned more with things like creativity,
adapability, drive, etc when hiring a CS grad.  I've found that having a
resume that shows these kind of traits well overcame the lack of a degree

awhile back.

The old way was that your HS provided what the mythical average person needed
to go about life. College was for the more "complex" careers.

&gt;And make it easier to hire people, instead of harder. (And if one hires a
&gt;maid, and the maid steals, cut off her hand. We've lost sight of justice,
&gt;and people think that ripping off the rich is their kind of justice. This
&gt;needs to change.)

You don't even need to be that harsh.  Chain-gang work to pay off stolen
property would be more effective, if for no reason other than that you'd get
your money (or property) back.

&gt;Psychologists and similar psychobabblers call it "tough love." If one
&gt;always "enables" an addict, a layabout, a shiftless worker, with excuses
&gt;and handouts, the behavior does not change. To save a person, sometimes
&gt;harshness is needed.

&gt;This is why crypto anarchy's starving of the tax system is good. It may
&gt;"kill" some number of people, as nearly any new idea does, but ultimately
&gt;it will put things back on track.


And you have to look at it from another point of view:   If it would
ameliorate the problems in the future for the majority of the population,
it'd be worth a bit of discomfort now.
