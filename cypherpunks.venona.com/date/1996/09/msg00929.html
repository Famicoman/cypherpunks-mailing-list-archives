&gt;&gt;&gt; Did anyone make the point (I gave up on the thread) that we already have a

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Tim May expressed doubt that it was worth the effort:  Not much easier
&gt;&gt;than the real thing, and not as good.  That's the closest to your point,
&gt;&gt;I think.
&gt;....
&gt;&gt;Finally, a MUD has the potential to spread crypto-anarchic ideas to people
&gt;&gt;who would not otherwise have considered them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It may be that I'm wasting my time, but I could come up with some useful
&gt;&gt;new crypto protocol too.
&gt;
&gt;Don't tar me with the "Tim said it was a waste of time" label. Rather, I
&gt;said I thought it would be pretty tough to get a reasonable ontology, one
&gt;with rich enough behaviors and reasonable incentives and disincentives.
&gt;Simulations are an art...they were useful in nuclear war planning, where
&gt;the degrees of freedom were constrained, and so on.

Jon Leonard made it clear to me that he was planning a human-assisted 
game/MUD, rather than a computer simulation.  His explanation is that it is 
difficult to implement an unbiased simulation, because it is difficult to 
"simulate" a human.  But putting people controlling characters into the 
equation restores the "human element" which arguably will make the results 
more realistic.  Makes sense to me.

The one item I suggested was that instead of people controlling individual 
characters in this MUD, they control a "weighted character" whose weight 
depends on the number of people of that type in the society.  After all, in 
the path towards a crypto anarchy-type situation, people will naturally have 
to migrade away from government-oriented solutions, and towards other jobs.  
Some will be killed, some will retire, some will switch jobs, etc.  Turning 
such a group into a weighted character would allow their number to reflect 
societal changes a more quantitatively than individual characters.
