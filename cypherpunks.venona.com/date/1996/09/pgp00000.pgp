Although I  tend to agree with  the general contents of  this message, I
want to  apologize to the  list for the  "noise".  Looking at  the logs,
showed that this message _was_ sent from one of our systems, however not
by me but by a person impersonating me.  Learning from this experience I
will leave this system  locked as well in the future,  but that will not
resolve this issue...  Anyway, no real harm was done (it could have been
a lot worse if the person actually knew what he was doing :-).
