&gt;   SHANGHAI (Sep 25, 1996 08:48 a.m. EDT) - China has removed limits on
&gt;   the country's number of Internet accounts following the recent
&gt;   installation of safety controls on the computer network, a senior
&gt;   Shanghai telecommunications official said on Wednesday.

	Safety controls... nice euphemism, similar to "key recovery".
   
&gt;   "Some time ago, our security arrangements were incomplete and there
&gt;   was a problem with pornographic and politically unacceptable
&gt;   material," said Zhang Weihua, vice-president of the Shanghai Post and
&gt;   Telecommunications Administration.

[...]

&gt;   Zhang said access to sites on the Internet containing pornographic or
&gt;   politically unacceptable material had been restricted, adding, "This
&gt;   material is restricted all over the world."
  
&gt;   He declined to give details of the security controls placed on the
&gt;   servers, saying he was only responsible for the technical side of the
&gt;   service.
   
&gt;   But Zhang did say he was unaware of any restrictions on access to
&gt;   major international news sites through China's Internet servers.
   
&gt;   Foreign reports have suggested that China has cut off access to such
&gt;   news sites. Analysts say that China is concerned over development of
&gt;   public computer networks and their use by people opposed to communist
&gt;   rule or communist policies.
   
[...]

&gt;   Zhang said for "security" reasons there was a need to control
&gt;   information and discussion on the Internet and related bulletin board
&gt;   services.
   
&gt;   "But surveys done on the usage and interests of people in China with
&gt;   Internet access indicate that virtually all the material they wanted
&gt;   to look at is domestic," he said.

	Due to language differences, I would guess.
   
&gt;   China's key Internet Service Provider (ISP) selling access accounts is
&gt;   Chinanet, controlled by the Post and Telecommunications Bureau.
   
&gt;   Zhang said the bureau took measures earlier this year to control
&gt;   unauthorised activities of other access providers, including
&gt;   Shanghai's Fudan University, in order to handle the security issue.
   
&gt;   China currently has access points to the Internet in Beijing and
&gt;   Shanghai. It has no plans to add more, Zhang said.
   
&gt;   He said his department was being assisted in building its computer
&gt;   network by several American-Chinese originally from mainland China who
&gt;   spent time working with the U.S. space agency NASA.

	I see.... (grimace)
