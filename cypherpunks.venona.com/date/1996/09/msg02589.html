      I never cease to be surprised by the interest that gentiles show  in
working mormon communities while totally neglecting their own failing
areas.

&gt; &gt;I guess that depends on your definition of liberty.  The Mormons
&gt; &gt;originally moved there to have a place to practice their religion,
&gt; &gt;and have freedom from persecution.  I suppose one could extend that
&gt; &gt;to wanting a place to have the freedom to have a set of rules consistant
&gt; &gt;with their beliefs.  Should that include freedom from interferance from
&gt; &gt;folks such as yourself who want to change their rules, even though
&gt; &gt;you're not presently effected?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if Utah can rig a way to _secede_ from the Union, your arguments
&gt; would make more sense. But so long as they are part of these United States,
&gt; their religious beliefs about when children should be at home cannot
&gt; supersede basic liberties.
&gt; 
&gt; (There are some thorny issues about whether _minors_ have full civil
&gt; rights. But I certainly know that _my_ civil rights are being affected when
&gt; my children are not allowed on the streets after some hour. If my child is
&gt; out, this is my problem. I neither want cops to stop-and-detain my
&gt; children, nor do I want my tax monies to be used to control the behavior of
&gt; other people's children. Providing no crimes are being committed, curfews
&gt; for the sake of controlling the behavior of children are no more just than
&gt; would be a bunch of related behavior control laws, e.g., a ban on comic
&gt; books, a mandate that all children join after-school youth leagues, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; As for "changing their rules," you're missing the point. There are
&gt; presumably many in Utah who believe as I do (maybe even some Mormons).
&gt; Those who are living in Utah, as renters, owners, whatever, should not be
&gt; bound by unconstitutional rules, no matter how many Mormon Elders favor
&gt; them. Unless the Mormons own _all_ of the property (and maybe not even
&gt; then, as renters have civil rights), they cannot impose their own notions
&gt; of morality on the rest of the population, except in compelling cases
&gt; (e.g., involving the well-known actual _crimes_).
&gt; 
&gt; I don't mean to pick on Mormons, as other communities have also attempted
&gt; to impose curfews and other restricitions on the children of others. My ire
&gt; was raised by Attila's enthusiastic support for laws which no
&gt; freedom-loving person should be enthusiastic about. Again, I have no
&gt; problem with Attila restricting his own children's movements, or joining
&gt; with other parents to control the behavior of their _own_ children, via
&gt; religious camps, religious schools, youth leagues, etc. He can even make
&gt; his own kids wear funny uniforms, funny religious hats, whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; But, for example, tellling _me_ when _my_ children may be out on public
&gt; streets (doing nothing illegal, neither robbing nor spray-painting nor
&gt; committing any other real crimes) is unacceptable.
&gt; 
&gt; I urge Attila (and others) to rethink enthusiastic support for curfews.
