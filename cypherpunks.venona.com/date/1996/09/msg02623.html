A couple of people have pointed out what he was talking about,
one of which is below.  I haven't been able to find an article on
the web that does more than reference the event.  I'll try to hunt
up one of the books.  If anyone cares, I'll post what I find later.

I suspect that Dmitri is referring to the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  
It's not a pretty story and is one of the low points of Mormon 
history.

The late historian Juanita Brooks wrote about the masscre, and about 
the leader, John D. Lee, in a couple of books.

&gt; &gt; I guess that depends on your definition of liberty.  The Mormons
&gt; &gt; originally moved there to have a place to practice their religion,
&gt; &gt; and have freedom from persecution.  I suppose one could extend that
&gt; &gt; to wanting a place to have the freedom to have a set of rules consistant
&gt; &gt; with their beliefs.  Should that include freedom from interferance from
&gt; &gt; folks such as yourself who want to change their rules, even though
&gt; &gt; you're not presently effected?
&gt; 
&gt; It's worth noting that one of Utah mormons favorite pastimes was to ambush
&gt; the settlers heading for California, kill them all, and take their property.
&gt; However the mormons were dealt with much less severely than the local Indians
&gt; who tried the same tricks. Pity.
