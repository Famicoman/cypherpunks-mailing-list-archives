So?  I was talking about NEW sales of firearms from license holders.  Let's
consider improving the future rather than preserving the past, shall
we?

! realized there was no law *I* was breaking, so I laughed too.
! 
! Most of these guns I kept no records on, nor did any laws say I had to.
! 
! (A few years ago it became necessary for even private citizen-units to

! sell a laser-equipped Heckler &amp; Koch SP-89 without creating a paper trail
! (as I'd not had one when I acquired the piece a few years earlier), so a

! file will mysteriously burn up if the Feds ever seek out his records. (Who

! computerized filing of records. This is one reason I quit the NRA: they are

! computerization of all files, and of course cross-referencing to files on
! citizens. This would be much worse than the "paper chaos" of stacks of
! firearms paperwork sitting in dusty filing cabinets. I'll take a 10-day
! ineffectual waiting period to a Big Brother database of all purchasers.)

So you'ld prefer the security of obscurity?  I'd prefer to have much more 
government protected rights, openly.  Do you belive the civil courts
have a role in protecting people's rights?  If so, then "government
protected rights."

! &gt;BTW, I muse that the issue of guns, drugs and censorship make an
! &gt;excellent litmus test for libertarians: either you support the
! &gt;legalization of, all of, or your a fake.
! 
! I'm not sure what the "legalization of censorship" would mean, though I
! support the right of anyone to screen out what they choose not to read or
! view. And I support the right of companies to decide what materials to buy,
! have viewed by employees, etc. (So if the "Valley Lesbigays" want to show a
! tape at Hewlett-Packard, H-P can just say "Nope--we're not interested.)
! 
! I fully support legalization of all drugs, all guns, and am unalterably
! opposed to any form of government censorship.

I meant the good side of the censorship issue!

But I also support enforcement of the anti-trust laws, so some would view
the court enforced break up of illegal collusion of the media to crush
competition as "government censorship."
