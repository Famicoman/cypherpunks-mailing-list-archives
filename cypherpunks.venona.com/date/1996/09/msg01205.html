                             ISC MEETING DETAILS
                              October 18-19, 1996

Members are urged to participate in one of the work groups that will be
presenting/meeting during the ISC's meeting.

    "Addendum" Work Group
     Contact: Ruven Schwartz (rschwart@research.westlaw.com)
              Tom Smedinghoff (tsmed@mbc.com)
              Joe Wackerman (jwackerm@email.usps.gov)
       The Addendum Work Group will continue drafting a digital signature
       trading partner agreement -- integrating the principles of the
       Digital Signature Guidelines, and developing additional practical
       commentary for this model form of electronic commerce agreement.

    Evidentiary Work Group
    Contact: Stan Kurzban (qbjw99a@prodigy.com) or
             Serge Parisien (parisise@droit.umontreal.ca)
       The Evidentiary Work Group will complete and present
       a provisional outline for a tutorial on the evidentiary
       implications of digitally signed information and advance drafting
       of material for each section of the tutorial.

    Key Escrow Work Group (KEWG)
    Contact: Dwight Olson (73522.3542@compuserve.com) or
             Randy Sabett (rsabett@venable.com)
       The KEWG will focus on the legal and technical aspects
       of commercial key escrow.  The group will seek to accurately
       explore all major issues surrounding this topic, and produce a set
       of draft guidelines for comment.  The proposed guidelines are
       intended to facilitate secure electronic commerce by
       clarifying the rights and obligations of the parties involved
       in voluntary commercial key escrow. The work product may take
       one or more forms including:
       (i)   a "restatement" of the relevant law and practice,
       (ii)  a model state or federal law or international convention,
       (iii) a set of principles that can be incorporated by reference
               into agreements or used for the interpretation of legal
               aspects of voluntary key escrow, or
       (iv)  a set of "gap filler" provisions.

    Liability Work Group
    Contact: Maureen Adamache (rmadama@magi.com)
       The liability work group will meet as necessary to discuss
       the apportionment of liabilities among PKI providers and users.
       Previously, this task was considered in the ISC's own work-product,
       the Digital Signature Guidelines.  Future documents that will
       be considered include Certification Practice Statements, and digital
       signature legislative and regulatory work product.

    State Government Digital Signatures Laws &amp; Regulations
    Contact: Dan Greenwood (DGreenwood@state.ma.us)
       The digital signature legislative and regulatory working group
       will compile, evaluate and compare the various emerging
       approaches by states and other jurisdictions. Work product will
       include a web-based comprehensive "one-stop shop" for
       jurisdictions wishing to review current approaches.


First-time participants (who plan to attend the October 18-19, 1996
meeting) must request attendance and submit a brief work-product
(typically 3-5 pages) relevant to the subject matter. Please contact Ruven
Schwartz (v: 612.687.8095, f: 612.687.7907, or e:
rschwart@research.westlaw.com) for details.

Meeting Location:
McCormack Building (Across Bowdoin Street from the State House)
1 Ashburton Place
Room 1, 21st Floor
Boston, Massachusetts USA
(Contact: Dan Greenwood +1 617.973.0071)

Meals:  The cafeteria will be available for lunch on Friday for those ISC
Members who choose to work through the joint lunch session.  On Saturday
we will probably order in pizza.

Lodging: A very nearby hotel is the Holiday Inn, Government Center, 5
Blossom Street, Boston. The regular rate during our meeting dates is
$219.95/night.  However, the Reservation Supervisor (Kim) has offered a
rate of $199.95 to Committee members who request the "Great Rate"  plan.
Call reservations at +1 617.742.7630.  For a better (but more expensive)
hotel near Government Center, try the Parker House at +1 617.227.8600.
The Omni Parker House (nicer than Holiday Inn) quoted a rate of $169/night
for a single with a king or queen bed and $119/night for a single with a
double bed.  The rooms are very small - but the hotel is nice.  See also a
Greater Boston Bed &amp; Breakfast directory:
<A  HREF="http://www.inovatec.com/bb/resservc/GREATER/GREATER.htm">http://www.inovatec.com/bb/resservc/GREATER/GREATER.htm</A>.

RSVP:  Please confirm your intention to participate to Ann Kowalsky,
Section Manager, Section of Science and Technology
(sciencetech@attmail.com) as soon as possible.

See you in Boston!
