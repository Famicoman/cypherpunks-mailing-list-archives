THE LATEST NEWS

The Senate Commerce Committee vote on S.1726 (Pro-CODE) originally set for
today (Thursday 9/12) has been postponed. We have been told that the change
was largely due to committee scheduling issues, and the Committee staff and
have indicated that they are still committeed to marking up S. 1726 within
the next.  More information should be available shortly.

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), co-author of S. 1726, asked us to forward the
following note to the net.community:

   X-POP3-Rcpt: jseiger@mailserver
   From: Conrad_Burns@burns.senate.gov
   Date: Thu, 12 Sep 96 09:55:35 EST
   To: jseiger@cdt.org
   Subject: Open Letter to the Internet from Senator Burns

     The Commerce Committee markup on Pro-CODE, S. 1726, that we had
     expected to have held on Thursday, September 12 has been postponed.  I
     am fully committed to taking Pro-CODE to markup, out of committee and
     onto the floor of the Senate in this Congress.  I believe that this
     legislation is vital to ensuring the continued strength of America's
     high-tech community and the privacy of its citizens.  I would like to
     thank the many thousands of Netizens who have expressed their support
     for Pro-CODE.

     Sincerely,

     U.S. Senator Conrad Burns

It is critical to keep your phone calls and faxes coming into the offices
of the Committee members listed below.  Based on the feedback we are
receiving from callers and conversations with Capitol Hill staff, the
response from the Net has been strong and continuous.  Thank you to all who
have taken the time to call Congress to voice your support for encryption
policy reform.

If you have not yet done so, please take a moment to call the committee
members below.  If you have a little extra time on your hands, between now
and the middle of next week please make an effort to call all the Senators
on the list below.  Your help and support is critical to the future of
privacy and security on the Internet.

Finally, please don't forget to sign the petition in support of Encryption
Policy Reform --  <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/petition/">http://www.crypto.com/petition/</A>.  More than 4000 Netizens
have already signed, including encryption experts Phil Zimmermann, Matt
Blaze, Phil Karn, and others.

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

It's crucial that you call the Commerce committee members below and
urge them to pass S.1726 out of committee without amendments.  (This is
also known as a "clean" bill.)  Any opportunity for amendments (even if
they are good) opens us up to the possibility of hostile amendments
that could restrict the use of encryption even further than today's
abysmal state.  It could even prohibit the use of encryption without
Clipper Chip-like key 'escrow' technology, which includes built-in
surveillance and monitoring functionality.

1. Call/Fax the members of the Senate Commerce committee and urge
   them to pass S.1726 out of committee "cleanly".  Do not use email,
   as it is not likely to be looked at in time to make a difference.

   Use the sample communique and directory listing below to make it a
   simple TWO MINUTE task.

2. Sign the petition to support strong encryption at
   <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/petition/">http://www.crypto.com/petition/</A>   !  Join other cyber-heroes as
   Phil Zimmermann, Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneier, Vince Cate, Phil Karn, and
   others who have also signed.

3. Over the next 7 days, it is crucial that you call all these members of
   the Senate Commerce Committee.

________________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND / WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK

For the past 3 years, Cyber-Rights Activists, citizens, and industry
leaders have been working hard to reform US encryption policy.

Support has been building behind several legislative proposals this
year because they send a clear signal to the Administration about the
need for security and privacy in the Information Age.  The digital
revolution is currently being held hostage by the White House's Cold
War restrictions on privacy-enhancing encryption technology.

Now, with Congress less than a month away from adjournment, everyone
who supports encryption and privacy is working to see this bill leave
committee in order to send a clear message to the White House that they
are on the wrong side of the encryption issue.  Although this bill may
not become law this year, its passage out of committee will be a
landmark event that will clearly tell the White House that the
Congress, the public, and the computer industry care about security and
privacy, and need strong, reliable encryption technology in order to
make the Internet a viable platform for commerce, education, and
democracy.

Success for our side is not certain, and the next week is not without risks.
On September 12th (or sometime soon after), the Senate Commerce committee
is expected to hold a "markup", where the bill is examined, voted on, and
if there are enough votes, passed out of committee.  Two things could
happen:

        -the committee could pass the bill as written,
        -the committee could pass the bill with amendments.

Any amendments are not likely to be friendly, and in particular, quiet
sources have told privacy activists that the Clinton Administration has been
readying a legislative assault on your right to use encryption for several
weeks now.  A Clipper-like amendment could be attached to the bill if
our side does not have enough votes to block all amendments.

It is crucial that all netizens who consider privacy and security important
take a moment to call members of the Commerce Committee right now and
urge them to vote S.1726 out of committee without amendments.

________________________________________________________________________
DESCRIPTION OF S.1726, PRO-CODE BILL

Privacy-enhancing encryption technology is currently under heavy restrictions
kept in place by the White House.  Encryption that is currently allowed to
be exported is not sufficient to protect confidential information.  This
policy acquires an "Alice-in-Wonderland" quality when one realizes that
strong encryption products are available abroad both for sale and for free
download off the Internet.

The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:

1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
    popular World Wide Web browsers.

2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
    strength.

3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.

5/2/96: Bi-partisan group of Senators introduce Pro-CODE Act, which would
free public-domain encryption software (such as PGP) for export, free much
