&gt; Money Laundering Alert: August 1996
&gt; 
&gt; 'Unauthorized' Banks Pose Laundering Threat
&gt; 
&gt; They are subject to none of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements
&gt; of the Bank Secrecy Act, receive no examinations from any banking
&gt; regulator, and may be on your bank's currency transaction reporting
&gt; exemption list.
&gt; 
&gt; The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency refers to them as
&gt; "entities that may be conducting banking operations in the U.S. without
&gt; a license." Money launderers probably refer to them as dreams come true
&gt; and, unless legitimate financial institutions are alert, can use them to
&gt; place illicit proceeds into the financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; They are "unauthorized" banks, and for the past five years the OCC has
&gt; been disseminating advisories to legitimate U.S. banks - but not to
&gt; consumers - in an effort to expose their existence and halt their
&gt; illegal operations.
&gt; 
&gt; These so-called "banks" offer a variety of banking services, often at
&gt; lower fees and better interest rates than legitimate banks offer. What
&gt; makes them different from a legitimate bank - and attractive to money
&gt; launderers -- is that they are not licensed by any U.S. banking agency
&gt; and thus do not have to meet regulatory standards.
&gt; 
&gt; Because the OCC and other federal bank regulators are not investigative
&gt; agencies, they can do little more than report these institutions to
&gt; those who are. If the entities are found to be operating a bank without
&gt; a license they can be prosecuted under the Glass-Steagell Act (Title 12,
&gt; USC Sec. 378(a)(2)).
&gt; 
&gt; Such prosecutions are rare. In one case in 1994, initiated by Federal
&gt; Reserve Board examiners, the principals of Lombard Bank, Ltd., were
&gt; charged with operating an unauthorized bank through a payable-through
&gt; account at American Express Bank International in Miami. Lombard, which
&gt; had been "licensed" in the South Pacific money laundering haven of
&gt; Vanuatu, offered its Central American customers virtually full banking
&gt; services in the U.S. through its PTA (MLA, Sep. 1994).
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier this year, the OCC released a list of more than 50 "banks" known
&gt; to be operating without authorization. OCC officials say the number
&gt; grows steadily. Some of the "banks" say they are licensed by foreign
&gt; countries or U.S. states to conduct banking business. Others, such as
&gt; the Swiss Trade &amp; Commerce Trust, Ltd., of Belize, continue to offer
&gt; services in the U.S. despite edicts from foreign banking authorities to
&gt; cease doing business.
&gt; 
&gt; The unauthorized entities have a common trait. They usually have names
&gt; that are similar to those of well-known legitimate institutions. The OCC
&gt; list includes the Bank of England, a Washington, D.C., entity not
&gt; associated with London's famous "old lady on Threadneedle Street" and
&gt; Citicorp Financial Services, a Beverly Hills firm not associated with
&gt; the better-known institution of that name. It also includes the First
&gt; Bank of Internet, which heralds itself as the first bank in cyberspace.
&gt; 
&gt; Through its periodic "special alerts," the OCC warns banks to "view with
&gt; extreme caution any proposed transaction involving any of the listed
&gt; entities." It makes no effort to educate members of the general public
&gt; who unknowingly place their money and trust in those uninsured
&gt; institutions.

&gt; 
&gt; Swift Near Alliance in Trade Document Automation
&gt; 
&gt; By STEVEN MARJANOVIC
&gt; 
&gt; Swift, the international banking telecommunications network, wants to
&gt; play a bigger role in trade finance and the exchange of related
&gt; documentation.
&gt; 
&gt; Sources said the Brussels-based organization will soon take a position--
&gt; perhaps as early as its September board meeting-- on whether to work on
&gt; trade automation in cooperation with another consortium, called Bolero.
&gt; 
&gt; Such a move would involve an increase in nonbank participants on a
&gt; bank-owned network that has approached such liberalization cautiously.
&gt; 
&gt; Swift, formally the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
&gt; Telecommunication, is used by 5,300 banks for exchanging messages in
&gt; such areas as funds transfer, foreign exchange, and securities.
&gt; 
&gt; The network averaged about 2.7 million messages a day in July,
&gt; representing daily dollar volumes exceeding $2 trillion.
&gt; 
&gt; Officials said Swift is nearing a decision to work with the Bolero
&gt; Association, which is forming an electronic registry for the so-called
&gt; "dematerializing" of trade documents. Swift could provide the "platform"
&gt; for allowing banks and corporations to exchange such documentation as
&gt; letters of credit and bills of lading.
&gt; 
&gt; Bolero was formed in 1994 with funding from the European Commission, but
&gt; has not formulated concrete operating plans. Its members include
&gt; Citicorp, Barclays Bank PLC, and other multinational banks and
&gt; corporations.
&gt; 
&gt; Peter Scott, trade services market director at Swift, said it has been
&gt; in discussions with London-based Bolero since December 1995 about
&gt; joining forces to automate the exchange of trade documents.
&gt; 
&gt; "Bankers are beginning to sense both the opportunities in those areas
&gt; and the threats to them from an intermediary stepping in and potentially
&gt; taking away the business," Mr. Scott said.
&gt; 
&gt; Trade-document capability "is not a heavily utilized area within Swift
&gt; at the present time," he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The potential in automation is obvious to Bolero officials. At the New
&gt; York Banktrade Conference recently, John McKessy, the association's
&gt; North American representative, said the annual value of goods moved
&gt; internationally approaches $4 trillion.
&gt; 
&gt; He estimated current international trade requires some three billion
&gt; documents to be issued and managed.
&gt; 
&gt; The cost of dealing with paper alone eats up about 7% of the total value
&gt; of those goods, as much as $280 billion, Mr. McKessy said.
&gt; 
&gt; Bank revenues from issuing letters of credit last year were just over $1
&gt; billion, according to a soon-to-be-released survey by the U.S. Council
&gt; on International Banking.
&gt; 
&gt; Anthony K. Brown, senior vice president of trade services at MTB Bank,
&gt; described trade transaction processing as "extremely cumbersome and
&gt; tedious, prone to mistakes and delays (that) can be a hindrance to the
&gt; completion of a transaction."
&gt; 
&gt; MTB is a $400 million-asset merchant bank based in New York. About 80%
&gt; of its $100 million in loans are trade-related.
&gt; 
&gt; The paper-shuffling costs are not borne entirely by banks. Import/export
&gt; companies, insurers, freight forwarders, and various government
&gt; inspection agencies are also involved.
&gt; 
&gt; "The question is whether Swift wants to do it," said Dan Taylor,
&gt; president of the New York-based U.S. Council.
&gt; 
&gt; "Swift is going to act fairly quickly on this," he added.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Taylor said Swift officials will likely grapple once again with the
&gt; political and philosophical issues of giving nonbanks more access to
&gt; Swift, and to payment systems generally.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1995, the network granted partial access to nonbanks after years of
&gt; heated debate.
&gt; 
&gt; "You always have this push and pull, where some banks would like Swift
&gt; to do certain things" while others want the network to focus on the
&gt; money transfer business, Mr. Taylor said.
&gt; 
&gt; "If Bolero succeeds and Swift joins, I think it will move fairly
&gt; rapidly, but I'm not sure that Bolero is going to be the only thing out
&gt; there."
&gt; 
&gt; He said Bolero might evolve using value-added networks - or intranets -
&gt; like the IBM Global Network and General Electric Information Services
&gt; Co., or perhaps even the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, another member of Bolero, CSI Complex Systems Inc., New York, is
&gt; apparently talking to several providers of private, value-added networks
&gt; and may soon enter a contract with one.
&gt; 
&gt; CSI letter-of-credit software leads the pack in banking, with about a
&gt; 16% market share, Mr. Taylor said.
&gt; 
&gt; The company recently formed a business unit called Electronic Documents
&gt; International, which has developed an Internet-based system for
&gt; initiating letters of credit. CSI spokesman George Capsis said the
&gt; software, Import.com, creates "about 30 key documents involved in
&gt; international trade."
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet, enhanced with security features, may help the trade
&gt; industry reduce paper-related costs, especially at smaller companies
&gt; overseas.
&gt; 
&gt; CSI managing director Andre Cardinale said customers need only to "dial
&gt; into a bank's Internet server, pull up the Import.com application, and
&gt; actually fill in the details to create a new letter of credit or an
&gt; amendment to an existing one."
&gt; 
&gt; While Bolero may find a place on the Internet or a GE-type network, Mr.
&gt; Cardinale said the ultimate push may yet come from the banking industry
&gt; working collectively through Swift.
&gt; 
&gt; He said Swift opposition from nonbank constituencies that are concerned
&gt; the telecommunications cooperative will be more sympathetic to banks
&gt; when disputes arise.
&gt; 
&gt; But "if Swift does it," he added, "it will bring banks into the universe
&gt; far more - pardon the pun - swiftly."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Crain's New York Business: August 26, 1996
&gt; 
&gt; Bloomberg to Detail Growth of Information Empire
&gt; 
&gt; Michael Bloomberg made a name for himself on Wall Street with his
&gt; trading acumen and mastery of the computer systems that were becoming
&gt; crucial to success in the securities business.
&gt; 
&gt; But no one suspected when he left Salomon Brothers in 1981 that in the
&gt; next decade he would build the fastest-growing provider of financial
&gt; information in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Bloomberg, whose company Bloomberg Financial Markets has estimated
&gt; sales of $600 million, will be the keynote speaker at the fifth annual
&gt; Crain's ''Growing a Business Expo,'' to be held this year on Thursday,
&gt; Oct. 24.
&gt; 
&gt; The event will take place at the New York Hilton &amp; Towers from 8 a.m. to
&gt; 1 p.m. It is presented by Citibank and co-sponsored by Con Edison and
&gt; Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
&gt; 
&gt; Last year, more than 1,000 growing business owners and managers attended
&gt; the expo, which provides information for companies operating in the city
&gt; regarding potential suppliers, financial resources and government
&gt; programs.
&gt; 
&gt; The cost to attend the event is $45 and includes a continental
&gt; breakfast. Individuals registering before Sept. 6 can bring a colleague
&gt; for free. To register, call Flagg Management at (212) 286-0333.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to Mr. Bloomberg's speech, attendees will be able to attend
&gt; seminars on financing and other help available from the city, financing
&gt; techniques, energy cost savings programs and how to reduce health
&gt; insurance costs. An expected 135 exhibitors will be offering products
&gt; and services of use to growing companies.
&gt; 
&gt; Crain's New York Business editors will discuss how a growing business
&gt; can get coverage in Crain's and in other publications.
&gt; 
&gt; The heart of Mr. Bloomberg's empire is a news gathering operation that
&gt; sends information through 62,000 computer terminals installed on the
&gt; desks of investment professionals around the nation. His company
&gt; provides the latest financial news and sophisticated tools to analyze
&gt; information.
&gt; 
&gt; The company he has built is noted for its lack of bureaucracy despite
&gt; its growth to 2,000 employees. Its hallmarks are hands-on leadership and
&gt; an entrepreneurial atmosphere where employees receive perks such as free
&gt; food.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Bloomberg has extended his reach to include an all-news radio
&gt; station in New York, WBBR; Bloomberg Personal TV; syndicated television
&gt; shows; a monthly personal finance magazine; and a similar magazine for
&gt; institutional investors.

&gt; 
&gt; American Banker: Friday, September 6, 1996
&gt; 
&gt; America Online Opens a New Banking Channel
&gt; 
&gt; By DREW CLARK
&gt; 
&gt; Nineteen banks - national home banking stalwarts such as Citicorp and
&gt; BankAmerica, plus a complement of less prominent regionals - have
&gt; climbed onto the America Online bandwagon.
&gt; 
&gt; Most already offer their customers several options for banking via
&gt; personal computer and view America Online, with its six million
&gt; subscribers, as a way to appeal to a broad cross-section of computer-
&gt; literate consumers.
&gt; 
&gt; Fourteen of the AOL banking partners will be delivering services through
&gt; BankNow, a software package developed for the interactive network by
&gt; Intuit Inc.
&gt; 
&gt; The other five banks have opted to use their own software. One of them -
&gt; Security First Network Bank, which operates entirely on the Internet -
&gt; will invite AOL users in through their Web browsers.
&gt; 
&gt; With its announcement this week, America Online Inc. takes its place
&gt; among the many alternative "channels" for on-line banking.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of the banks on AOL's list are simultaneously cooperating with
&gt; other companies that are themselves competitors, such as Intuit and
&gt; Microsoft Corp., suppliers of the Quicken and Money financial management
&gt; software, respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Also crossing competitive lines, America Online said its subscribers
&gt; will be able to bank from home with PC software from three suppliers
&gt; other than Intuit: Checkfree Corp., Online Resources and Communications
&gt; Corp., and Visa Interactive.
&gt; 
&gt; "Everyone understands that there is competition in the home banking
&gt; arena," said David Baird, general manager of the personal finance
&gt; division at America Online, based in Dulles, Va. "To align ourselves
&gt; with exclusively one company would be a mistake."
&gt; 
&gt; Intuit can count on 14 initial bank users of BankNow. Spokesmen for the
&gt; other three system vendors declined to say when they expect to have home
&gt; banking products available for the AOL channel.
&gt; 
&gt; Experts noted that AOL and Intuit could be a strong tandem, in that they
&gt; dominate their respective businesses.
&gt; 
&gt; Intuit's Quicken is the leading brand in personal finance software. The
&gt; company claims more than 9 million active users and a market share of
&gt; about 80%.
&gt; 
&gt; America Online's subscriber base of six million is as big as those of
&gt; its next two competitors, Compuserve and Prodigy, combined.
&gt; 
&gt; The financial institutions currently offering BankNow are: American
&gt; Express, Bank of Stockton (Calif.), Centura Banks Inc., Commerce Bank of
&gt; Kansas City, Mo., Commercial Federal of Omaha, Compass Bank of Alabama,
&gt; CoreStates Financial Corp., Crestar Financial Corp., First Chicago NBD
&gt; Corp., Laredo (Tex.) National Bank, M&amp;T Bank of Western New York,
&gt; Marquette Bank of Minneapolis, Sanwa Bank California, and Union Bank of
&gt; California.
&gt; 
&gt; More plan to offer BankNow-based services through AOL later this year:
&gt; BankAtlantic of Florida, Bank of Boston, First Hawaiian Bank, First
&gt; Michigan Bank, Mellon Bank, Signet Bank, and U.S. Bank of Oregon.
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike Quicken, BankNow software is available free to America Online
&gt; subscribers.
&gt; 
&gt; Banks' fees will vary. First National Bank of Chicago said it will
&gt; charge $3.95 a month for on-line banking and $9.95 a month for other
&gt; services that include bill payment.
&gt; 
&gt; Centura Banks Inc. said it will offer on-line banking free, and charge
&gt; $5.95 a month for bill payment.
&gt; 
&gt; Intuit officials declined to disclose what its Intuit Services Corp.
&gt; processing unit will charge to handle these transactions for banks.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of Intuit's larger bank partners chose not to offer BankNow because
&gt; they already promote their own PC banking programs.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, Citicorp, First Union, and Wells Fargo each support
&gt; Quicken, but passed on BankNow. Instead, they are paying a premium for a
&gt; "button" on America Online's banking screen that will eventually link
&gt; users to a proprietary home banking program.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; AP Online: Thursday, September 5, 1996
&gt; 
&gt; House Probes Money Laundering
&gt; 
&gt; By ROB WELLS
&gt; 
&gt; House Banking Committee members on Thursday urged a Treasury Department
&gt; agency to step up its efforts to halt money laundering by Mexican drug
&gt; lords.
&gt; 
&gt; Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., urged the Financial Crimes Enforcement
&gt; Network to put in place new regulations to plug a significant loophole
&gt; that allows Mexico's drug dealers to place their ill-gotten profits back
&gt; into the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; Bachus, chairman of the House Banking oversight subcommittee, said
&gt; Congress gave authority to FinCen in 1994 to put in place new rules that
&gt; would prevent drug dealers from using foreign bank drafts, a type of
&gt; check, to evade currency reporting restrictions.
&gt; 
&gt; ''That effort is long, long overdue,'' Bachus said.
&gt; 
&gt; Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, asked the agency to provide further
&gt; details about suspected money laundering in his home town of San
&gt; Antonio, particularly the source of a $3 billion cash surplus in the San
&gt; Antonio Federal Reserve Bank.
&gt; 
&gt; The issue arose as Bachus' panel began exploring the dramatic rise of
&gt; narcotics traffic along the 2,000 mile long U.S.-Mexico border, and the
&gt; ease with which drug dealers can ship their profits to the south. Money
&gt; laundering refers to the practice by which drug dealers, mobsters and
&gt; others funnel their illegal profits into the banking system through
&gt; businesses or other means.
&gt; 
&gt; Bachus said estimates of drug profits laundered through Mexico range
&gt; from $6 billion to $30 billion per year. Stanely E. Morris, FinCen's
&gt; director, defended his agency's record, saying a combination of new
&gt; rules and tougher enforcement in the past decade has ''made it more
&gt; difficult to launder money in the U.S.'' and increased the costs of
&gt; money laundering. Morris' agency enforces the Bank Secrecy Act, a key
&gt; weapon against money laundering.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the new rules aimed at foreign bank drafts, Morris said the
&gt; regulations are more difficult than first expected because such
&gt; restrictions also could hinder legitimate commerce. He said the proposal
&gt; would be released soon.
&gt; 
&gt; FinCen is working on other fronts to combat money laundering, which
&gt; includes a new computer system that tallies bank fraud to help
&gt; regulators gain an early warning of money laundering.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, the Clinton Administration assisted Mexico in adopting new
&gt; anti-money laundering rules earlier this year. And Treasury Secretary
&gt; Robert Rubin convened a conference of 29 nations in December 1995 to
&gt; focus on the money laundering problem.
&gt; 
&gt; One committee member, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., addressed the
&gt; political context of the hearings.
&gt; 
&gt; Waters said she was suspicious that the Republican-led Congress was
&gt; holding ''a rash of hearings this month ... on the subject of drugs just
&gt; as Presidential candidate Dole tries to use the issue as part of his
&gt; campaign strategy against President Clinton.''
&gt; 
&gt; Waters said if the GOP-led House ''is truly serious about the impact of
&gt; drugs'' it should hold hearings about charges raised in a San Jose
&gt; Mercury News investigative series last month concerning the role
&gt; CIA-backed rebels in Nicaragua played in bringing crack cocaine and
&gt; weapons to Los Angeles and other cities.

&gt; Bachus told Waters the hearing wasn't motivated by politics and that he
&gt; had personally been involved in anti-drug efforts prior to his election
&gt; to Congress.
