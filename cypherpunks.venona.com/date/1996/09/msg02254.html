Did you know this company is using your email address as part of
an unlawful email bomb?

I would advise you to write to them at cypherpunks@toad.com
and owner-cypherpunks@toad.com and advise them to stop
using your email address for this type of activity.

It is illegal to use a invalid return email address.  If this continues, I
will
be forced to prosecute the return email address - which they are
making to look like you.

Below is the letter that I received in my email box
=================================================

In a message dated 96-09-25 14:05:23 EDT, you write:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;AP stuff&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone who mistakes the lack of "repudiations" for AP on the list for
some
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of tacit approval is not getting the whole picture, IMHO.  
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this how journalists do their research nowadays -- "give me some info
&gt;or
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll write something really bad about you that you'll regret?"  Cool.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt; guess I thought there might still be some kind of pursuit of the truth
&gt;&gt;&gt; involved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I personally don't have the time or energy to contribute to the AP
&gt;threads.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That != approval for the idea.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you include your above quote in your piece.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Amen to that.  Add that at least one lawyer (and former prosecutor) on 
&gt;&gt;the list is confident that successful prosecutions will ensue is AP ever 
&gt;&gt;gets off the ground. 
&gt;
&gt;I don't doubt that there will be harassment.  (you can't deny that charges 
&gt;would be brought even if it is tacitly agreed that no crime has been 
&gt;committed; "the harassment-value" of such a prosecution would be desired 
&gt;even if there is ultimately an acquittal.)  AP will resemble, more than 
&gt;anything, gambling.  While gambling is illegal in some areas, it is quite 
&gt;legal in others and there is no reason to believe that locales can't be 
&gt;found in which an AP system could operate legally.
&gt;
&gt;Make American laws apply everywhere?  That'll be hard to justify, unless you

&gt;want to unleash a world where an all people can be subject simultaneously to

&gt;the laws of EVERY country, should they choose to enforce them!  Would you 
&gt;like to be arrested in Red China for something you said years earlier in 
&gt;America about their leadership? 
&gt;
&gt; And are you ignoring the fact that the intentional isolation of one 
&gt;participant from the knowledge of the actions and even the identity of the 
&gt;others makes opportunities for prosecution on "conspiracy" charges mighty 
&gt;slim.  And since AP can operate across traditional jurisdictional 
&gt;boundaries, you're going to have to explain how you can prosecute Person A 
&gt;in Country B for giving a donation to an organization in Country C, to be 
&gt;paid to a person D in country E for correctly predicting the death of person

&gt;F in country G, particularly when none of the identities of these people or 
&gt;countries can be easily known given a well-crafted cryptographic and 
&gt;message-routing system.  
&gt;
&gt;  Further, as you probably know as well as any, in order (at least, 
&gt;supposedly!) to get a conviction you need to prove "mens rea," or "guilty 
&gt;mind," and I suggest that none of the more passive participants in the AP 
&gt;system have that.  (The ones who DON'T pick up a gun, knife, bomb, poison, 
&gt;etc.)  Sure, they are aware that somewhere, sometime, somebody _may_ commit 
&gt;a crime in order to collect a lottery, but they don't know who, what, when, 
&gt;where, or how this will occur, if at all. (either before or after the fact!)

&gt;  In fact, since it is possible for a target to collect the reward himself 
&gt;(to be directed toward his designee, obviously) by committing suicide and 
&gt;"predicting" it, it isn't certain to the other participants that there has 
&gt;even been any sort of crime committed!
&gt;
&gt;Based on the mens rea requirement, I propose that there is plenty of room 
&gt;for most of the participants to reasonably claim that they are guilty of no 
&gt;crime.  They have carefully shielded themselves and others from any guilty 
&gt;knowledge, and presumably they are entitled to protect themselves in this 
&gt;way.  Morally, you could argue that these people are countenancing something

&gt;nasty, in the same sense that somebody could equally well argue that if you 
&gt;buy a cheap shirt in Walmart you're partly responsible for sweatshop labor 
&gt;in El Salvador.  True, I suppose, but moral guilt does not always translate 
&gt;into legal guilt.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; And yes, I've read Jim Bell's manifesto.  The fact 
&gt;&gt;that no lawyer has dissected it from a legal standpoint has been used by 
&gt;&gt;Mr. Bell as support for the propostion that it is legal.
&gt;
&gt;I suggest that there is a greater likelihood that the "powers that be" will 
&gt;just abandon all pretense of legality, and attempt to strike at the 
&gt;participants if they can find them without benefit of any sort of trial. 
&gt;This is a more plausible conclusion, because it cuts through all of the 
&gt;legal difficulties which would hinder prosecution.  In effect, a low-level 
&gt;undeclared war.
