SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG TO FIND.  THIS WAS ON OUR OCPM EASTERN REGION BBS
MESSAGE 07-17-96, FROM JACKIE MCLEER, SUBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
RECRUITMENT.


I GUESS YOU HAVE HEARD BY NOW THAT PLANS FOR REGIONIZATION HAS BEEN PUT ON
HOLD DO TO LACK OF MONEY.

THEY SAY WE WON'T BE GOING ANY WHERE OR DOING ANY THING UNTIL AT LEAST
1999.

THERE IS TALK OF A RIF HERE!  50 PEOPLE THIS YEAR (97) AND 50 THE NEXT TWO
YEARS(98 &amp; 99). WE HAVE TO BE DOWN TO 160 BY THE YEAR 2000.

I THINK MY JOB IS SAFE, THEY CAN'T GET THE WORK DONE NOW WITH 12 PERSONNEL
ACTIONS CLERK I CAN'T  SEE THEM DOING IT WITH LESS.


DID YOU HAVE A NICE HOLIDAY?  DO ANYTHING SPECIAL?  

WE HAD RAIN ALL FOUR DAYS - (I HAD TAKEN OFF FRIDAY) - BUT IT WAS GREAT
JUST NOT BEING AT WORK!

I HAD BILL'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT DELIVERED EARLY (SEPT 18 IS HIS B'DAY).  I
GOT HIM A TV HE COULD SEE WITHOUT SITTING ON TOP OF -- RCA 52 INCH
PROSCAN.  IT'S GREAT AND HE SEEMS TO REALLY LOVE IT.  I DON'T WATCH ENOUGH
TO MATTER, BUT IT IS NICE FOR MOVIES.  SHELLY AND HER DAUGHTER LESLIE CAME
OVER FRIDAY EVENING TO HAVE PIZZA AND WATCH A MOVIE.  THEY LIKED IT TOO!

HOPE THINGS ARE GOING BETTER THERE.  MY JOB IS GOING OK FOR NOW BUT A LOT
OF THIS IS MEDICATION. MY DOCTOR PUT ME ON SOMETHING AGAIN WHEN I SAW HIM
LAST MONTH.  BLOOD PRESSURE WAY UP AND STARTING TO FEEL LIKE I WOULD CRY
ANY MINUTE OVER ANYTHING!  I SEE HIM AGAIN SEPT 13 MAYBE HE'LL TELL ME
EVERYTHINGS OK (HA!:)

THATS ALL FOR NOW - ITS SOMEWHERE AROUND 4 AM AND I HAVE TO GET READY FOR
WORK.

HI TO HOLLY!

LOVE YA!

KATHY

&gt;&gt; from the radical left that is illegal in Germany, but not in
&gt;&gt; the Netherlands.

&gt;This is amazing. Without defending the German stand on the Revisionist
&gt;crap, that part is at least understandable in a historical context
&gt;(their sense of guilt for the unfortunate developments in the 30's
&gt;and 40's etc). But a quick overview of the contents of Radikal gives the
&gt;impression of an ordinary leftist zine, defining the outlawing of it as
&gt;pure political censorship in a Western 'democracy'. I'm truly surprised.

&gt;Asgaard

Is there an URL with a English version?

I am always curious to see what governments think they should "protect" their citizens from.


Thanks,
