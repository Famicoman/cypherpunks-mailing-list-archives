Hello Everyone,

	I just posted a new type2.list/pubring.mix combination on jpunix.com 
that reflects the fact that aD and nemesis have not responded for quite 
some time. They have been dropped from the lists. Type2.list and 
pubring.mix are available by WWW from www.jpunix.com as well as by 
anonymous FTP from ftp.jpunix.com.
