	As I recall, the alleged "subsidy" consists of lack of payments so
rural areas can have subsidized phone service - thus making their costs borne
by everyone else.

&gt;                INTERNET IS HURTING PHONE NETWORKS, STUDY SAYS

&gt;   SAN FRANCISCO (Aug 27, 1996 3:11 p.m. EDT) -- Hoping to reduce or end
&gt;   a subsidy that has kept down the cost of on-line service, local phone
&gt;   companies here have presented the Federal Communications Commission
&gt;   with studies arguing that Internet users are overtaxing phone networks
&gt;   and ought to pay more for monthly service.
   
&gt;   The studies, one of which was published on the Internet, argue that a
&gt;   13-year-old subsidy lets Internet service providers (ISPs) pay a
&gt;   fraction of what a long distance company pays to get a phone line,
&gt;   even though Internet calls may use more phone system capacity than
&gt;   voice traffic.
   
[...]

&gt;   For their part, ISPs are alarmed at the remote possibility that the
&gt;   FCC might let phone companies raise their monthly costs from the
&gt;   current monthly average of $30 to anything approaching the $600 that
&gt;   some long distance carriers pay for a phone line.
   
&gt;   "If we had to pay anything like long distance access charges, it would
&gt;   put all the ISPs out of business," said Ronald Plesser, the
&gt;   Washington, D.C., attorney who represents the Commercial Internet
&gt;   Exchange, an ISP trade group.
   
&gt;   FCC staff attorney Kevin Werbach said the subsidy began in 1983, when
&gt;   the five-member federal commission created a special rate to encourage
&gt;   the growth of on-line services, voicemail companies and other emerging
&gt;   industries that offered enhanced electronic services over phone lines.
   
&gt;   In 1987, the FCC considered ending the subsidy but backed down after
&gt;   public protest over what came to be characterized as the "modem tax."
&gt;   Given the growth in on-line usage, ISPs assume any talk of ending the
&gt;   subsidy would create a bigger backlash today.
   
&gt;   "There are a minimum of 20 million and perhaps as many as 40 million
&gt;   on-line and Internet users and many of them are registered voters,"
&gt;   said William Schrader, president of PSI Net, an ISP in Herndon, Va.
   
&gt;   Schrader said when he visited several FCC members recently, he
&gt;   suggested that many of those users would be happy to send a letter of
&gt;   protest to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
