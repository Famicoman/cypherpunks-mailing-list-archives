&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I got a message from Lorenz Lorenz-Meyer, Editor DER SPIEGEL online. He
&gt; spoke to the German Authorities and got some shocking news.
&gt; It seems that there is a possibility that I, as CEO of Dutch
&gt; internetprovider Xs4all, could get arrested by German authorities.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems a bit far-off, but he is not the only person that
&gt; warned me about this possibility. People in the left-wing movement
&gt; in Holland have informed me about the agressive behaviour of the
&gt; German government against the Radikal publications. Subscribers 
&gt; have been violently arrested in the past. It was also predicted
&gt; by them that the German Authorities would not easily stop their
&gt; censorship of radikal. There seems to be a lot of old pain.
&gt; 
&gt; Contemplating a bit further about the risk of being arrested,
&gt; I thought about these developments on a larger scale. The first
&gt; thing that popped to mind is that all the owners of the Radikal
&gt; mirror-sites may also be arrested if they ever visit Germany. These
&gt; are over 30 people and organisations. One of the sites Radikal was
&gt; mirrored on is EFF. The Board-members of EFF could, in theory, 
&gt; be held responsible by the German Authorities. John Perry Barlow
&gt; could be arrested next time he comes to give a lecture in a 
&gt; German city, because the EFF has illegal German documents on
&gt; it's website. Declan McCullagh has put the Radikal information
&gt; in the Well. He and the managers of the Well might be questioned
&gt; when they enter Germany. Et cetera. It would be an outrage if
&gt; anything like this happens, but friends and this journalist told me
&gt; that it could happen to me anytime I travel to Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm tempted to disconnect the Radikal pages from Xs4all, because
&gt; of this intense intimidation. But if Xs4all would bend to this kind
&gt; of intimidation, we would create a precedent. The Germans might see it as
&gt; a 'reward' for their acts. They'd be stimulated to continue on this
&gt; road, and may become an example for other countries.
&gt; Imagine if every country would have these standards. Any country can
&gt; order their own ISP's to block a certain foreign site. Imagine the
&gt; authorities of those countries have the powers to prosecute against
&gt; foreign ISP's when they visit their country, or when they are extradited.
&gt; These acts of agression against ISP's and internetusers will profoundly
&gt; change the Internet if they'd be tolerated. 
&gt; 
&gt; The possibility of being arrested in our neighbour country is almost
&gt; too surreal to think about. But now people start telling me to seriously
&gt; prepare for it, in case it may happen. It would not be the first time
&gt; a foreign citizen was arrested and put in jail by the Germans for
&gt; dissiminating information. Just a couple of weeks ago a US citizen
&gt; was arrested by the Germans because he sent nazi documentation to
&gt; Germany through the mail, i think his name was Koch, but i'm not 
&gt; sure.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the message lorenz sent me:

&gt;  Subject: third attempt
&gt;  
&gt;  Hi Felipe,
&gt;  
&gt;  I just had an extensive and controversial talk
&gt;  via phone with Mr. Hannich, spokesman of the german
&gt;  Generalbundesanwalt, about the legal action taken
&gt;  against the distributors of "radikal". As is the
&gt;  nature of talks with official spokespersons it was
&gt;  not utterly satisfying. But anyway. Just one question:
&gt;  
&gt;  The possible targets of german public
&gt;  prosecution are not only german ISPs.
&gt;  There are 'preliminary proceedings' of the 
&gt;  Bundesanwaltschaft against 'unknown' - i.e. 
&gt;  the persons responsible for making
&gt;  "radikal" accessible in Germany over 
&gt;  the Internet, _even if they are in foreign
&gt;  countries_. I'm afraid that this already includes 
&gt;  you. Have you been notified of this fact?
&gt;  And do you have plans to guard/defend yourself?
&gt;  
&gt;  Regards,
&gt;  
&gt;  Lorenz.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
