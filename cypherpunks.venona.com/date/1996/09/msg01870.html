I recently sent the following article to this mailing list:

]scene of an accident, etc (which I rather doubt he was planning to pay) and let
]him drive on (still without the licence).

I received the following e-mail from either Timmy May using an alternate
account, or someone whose IQ is similar to Timmy's, in response:

Just now I received about 2 dozen similar e-mails from this address, which
therefore must be Timmy May's - I can't believe that there are two people on
the 'net this stupid and obnoxious and prone to lying. In particular, I receive
this spam from Timmy in response to each 'crypto-relevant wire clippings' post.

Timmy May is definitely turning this mailing list into a political rant
menagerie where cryptography discussions are not welcome.
