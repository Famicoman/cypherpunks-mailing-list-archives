THE LATEST NEWS

Sometimes things work out better than imagined.  This was the feeling
tonight as I waded through my email from people all over the country that
called the commerce committee.  This was the feeling as I heard from visitors
to one Senator's office who, while waiting for a few minutes in the lobby,
listened to the receptionist take two quick calls from netizens calling
about the bill.

Receptionist, cutting the caller off: "S.1726?  Yes, I'll pass that along
to the Senator, thanks.  We've been getting a lot of calls."

Another netizen emailed us saying that he also called his Representative.
It turns out this Rep. has some friends who have co-sponsored HR 3011, the
House version of Pro-CODE.  The calls and elevated publicity from this phone
campaign have convinced him to consider co-sponsoring HR 3011.

This is great, but our success has mobilized the anti-crypto forces
into action as well.  The Clinton Administration, who has long opposed
the right of citizens to use non-Clipper encryption, has begun working
behind the scenes to make sure that the vote on Pro-CODE (S.1726) never
happens.

To have the Senate Commerce committee go on record that encryption exports
should be loosened, against the will of the Administration, would be
an embarrassment to the White House.  They have begun pushing hard to
pressure Democratic Commerce Committee members to put the brakes on the
bill, and do everything they can to prevent the vote this Thursday.

To see the business community, the industry, and the public line up the
Administration would be extremely hard to take and still seem
credible.

It's crucial that we continue to make noise and ring those phones.  By
pulling enough favors with members of the Senate Commerce Committee, it's
possible that the White House could prevent this vote from happening.

WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.  Appropriately forward this to everyone you
know until the expiration listed above.  Go to work, bug your neighbor
in the cubicle or office next to you.  Have they called yet?  Bug them
until they do.  Call the rest of the members you haven't gotten around to
yet.

And don't forget to sign the petition at <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/petition/">http://www.crypto.com/petition/</A> !

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

It's crucial that you call the Commerce committee members below and
urge them to pass S.1726 out of committee without amendments.  (This is
also known as a "clean" bill.)  Any opportunity for amendments (even if
they are good) opens us up to the possibility of hostile amendments
that could restrict the use of encryption even further than today's
abysmal state.  It could even prohibit the use of encryption without
Clipper Chip-like key 'escrow' technology, which includes built-in
surveillance and monitoring functionality.

1. Call/Fax the members of the Senate Commerce committee and urge
   them to pass S.1726 out of committee "cleanly".  Do not use email,
   as it is not likely to be looked at in time to make a difference
   for the markup on September 12th.

   Use the sample communique and directory listing below to make it a
   simple TWO MINUTE task.

2. Sign the petition to support strong encryption at
   <A  HREF="http://www.crypto.com/petition/">http://www.crypto.com/petition/</A>   !  Join other cyber-heroes as
   Phil Zimmermann, Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneier, Vince Cate, Phil Karn, and
   others who have also signed.

3. Between now and Wed. September 12, it is crucial that you call all
   these members of Congress.

________________________________________________________________________
BACKGROUND / WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK

For the past 3 years, Cyber-Rights Activists, citizens, and industry
leaders have been working hard to reform US encryption policy.

Support has been building behind several legislative proposals this
year because they send a clear signal to the Administration about the
need for security and privacy in the Information Age.  The digital
revolution is currently being held hostage by the White House's Cold
War restrictions on privacy-enhancing encryption technology.

Now, with Congress less than a month away from adjournment, everyone
who supports encryption and privacy is working to see this bill leave
committee in order to send a clear message to the White House that they
are on the wrong side of the encryption issue.  Although this bill may
not become law this year, its passage out of committee will be a
landmark event that will clearly tell the White House that the
Congress, the public, and the computer industry care about security and
privacy, and need strong, reliable encryption technology in order to
make the Internet a viable platform for commerce, education, and
democracy.

Success for our side is not certain, and the next week is not without risks.
On September 12th, the Senate Commerce committee will hold a "markup",
where the bill is examined, voted on, and if there are enough votes,
passed out of committee.  Two things could happen:

	-the committee could pass the bill as written,
	-the committee could pass the bill with amendments.

Any amendments are not likely to be friendly, and in particular, quiet
sources have told privacy activists that the Clinton Administration has been
readying a legislative assault on your right to use encryption for several
weeks now.  A Clipper-like amendment could be attached to the bill if
our side does not have enough votes to block all amendments.

It is crucial that all netizens who consider privacy and security important
take a moment to call members of the Commerce Committee right now and
urge them to vote S.1726 out of committee without amendments.

________________________________________________________________________
DESCRIPTION OF S.1726, PRO-CODE BILL

Privacy-enhancing encryption technology is currently under heavy restrictions
kept in place by the White House.  Encryption that is currently allowed to
be exported is not sufficient to protect confidential information.  This
policy acquires an "Alice-in-Wonderland" quality when one realizes that  
strong encryption products are available abroad both for sale and for free
download off the Internet.

The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:

1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
    popular World Wide Web browsers.

2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
    strength.

3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.

5/2/96: Bi-partisan group of Senators introduce Pro-CODE Act, which would
free public-domain encryption software (such as PGP) for export, free much

Leahy (D-VT), Murray (D-WA), Pressler (R-SD), and Wyden (D-OR).

3/5/96: Sen. Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA) announce encryption bills

such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).
