Anonymity and nonescrowed crypto are the linchpins of AP and its more 
general case, Maysian crypto anarchy. The withering of the nation-state. 
Whatever you want to call it.

To prevent it, governments will ban both. A criminal law, passed in the
wake of say a bombing this fall in Washington, DC, banning nonescrowed
crypto. (Freeh will assert he has evidence the terrorists used PGPhone.)
And another law banning online anonymity. 

What then, Mr. Bell?

&gt; &gt; If by "operation effectiveness" you mean some people will be killed,
&gt; &gt; I agree.  I also agree with the fire/water comment (maybe in more
&gt; &gt; ways than one!); my comment related to my belief that AP-supporters
&gt; &gt; shouldn't complain about especially draconian measures taken against
&gt; &gt; them by governments, given their modus operandi.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that any of them will complain because they understand 
&gt; the nature of it.  I think that Jim Bell (forgive me Jim...:) view 
&gt; that there will be only limited retaliation from government is not 
&gt; guaranteed at all.  As I said somewhere previously, the whole thing 
&gt; will depend on how the authorities view AP as (non-) attackable.  
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the post I wrote earlier:

&gt; &gt; Local police action against an AP organization would, of course, be

&gt; &gt; and soliciting donations against them.  
&gt; 
&gt; I don't agree here.  It would all be a matter of timing, unless the
&gt; number of AP servers would be sprouting out faster than police forces
&gt; would be able to destroy them.  You have to realize that if the money
&gt; is seized, noboby will be willing to make a hit since the odds of
&gt; being paid are not too good.  Just play the game "Command and Conquer"
&gt; for a while and you'll see.  Money is fuel.  Don't run off of it!
&gt; 
&gt; For that reason, I think that any AP server, *at the introduction of
&gt; the concept*  would have to be a covert operation.  Servers could come out in
&gt; public light when their number be large enough to warrant a
&gt; strike on anybody trying to eliminate them.  Same for the
&gt; publication of the name of the individuals operating the server.
&gt; 
&gt; To me, this seems obvious.  Comments?
&gt; 
&gt; To go on along that line, I had the idea that a specific piece of
&gt; software, a bit like Private Idaho, that would chain remailers but
&gt; that would be specifically designed to handle predictions, would
&gt; have be designed.
&gt; 
&gt; (Pardon my ignorance of the net here)
&gt; 
&gt; The server need not to be a unique address.  Actually, the
&gt; prediction and any accompanying documents could be splitted a la
&gt; Secure Split, and sent to N differents servers, M (&lt;N) of which
&gt; would be required to re-assemble the original prediction.  This
&gt; assures that if one gets closed, the other can rebuild the message.
&gt; 
&gt; If thoses servers were set up on *large* machines servicing tens of
&gt; thousands of messages a day, preferably located at a busy remailer
&gt; location, any exchange of information between them to rebuild the
&gt; prediction at a central location would not be easy to track by any 
&gt; govt.
