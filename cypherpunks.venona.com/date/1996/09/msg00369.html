Yes, and that is why some companies (e.g., Private Lines) offer anonymous
out-bound calling services.

&gt;
&gt;I think cpunks should hold the view that communication is a matter
&gt;of mutual consent between sender and receiver. if a receiver says,
&gt;"I don't want any anonymous messages", then should be able to block them.
&gt;this is essentially what is happening with the remailers *right*now*,
&gt;if you ask any remailer operator. people ask not to receive anonymous
&gt;mail, and are put on the blocking lists. imho only the extremists are arguing,
&gt;and have always argued, that they should have some ability to put
&gt;an anonymous message in front of someone else against their will.
&gt;
&gt;this basic rule becomes more murky when you look at public forums,
&gt;because you can't really say whether given individuals reading them want to
&gt;hear something anonymous or not. by designing the forum beforehand
&gt;to force the situation, you solve this problem.
&gt;

I find most unwanted communications objectionable, anonymous or not. How
about billboards.  Should the fact that I choose to be outside or on a
roadway make my eye a target for ads? (If so, then why not consider having
an e-mail account in a similar vein?)  The fact that I can immediately, or
later, identify the responsible party doesn't keep me from initially seeing
the ad and taking my time.  If I object, what are my alternatives?  The
last thing I want is monetary compensation.  I want my time back.  Failing
this, I want the abusers time (sorta' like in Zardoz).


&gt;I do believe that in the future there will be all types of forums: those in
&gt;which identity is required, those in which it is optional, and those in
&gt;which it is always cloaked. this is eminently reasonable imho.
&gt;those who argue against one of the
&gt;above's existence (such as saying it involves a ghettoization
&gt;of anonymity, that there should always be an ability to be anonymous
&gt;in any communication setting) are extremists imho.

"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable
one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
