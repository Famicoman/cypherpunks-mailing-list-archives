Sorry about this message that went out.  Looks like I got a few idiot
sending messages from a hacked account. Sorry for the waste of bandwith.  

Thanks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; His admission that he used _which_ notebook? Chain of evidence again.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Finding _which_ software?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (As for the Customs agent, I can assure you that my luggage has never been
&gt; &gt; &gt; checked upon either leaving the U.S. or entering the U.S. Even if U.S.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Customs could figure out who was working at the time I putatively entered
&gt; &gt; &gt; the country, and even if he remembered _me_, months later, just what
&gt; &gt; &gt; records would he have, and how would they stand up in court?)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hearing me say I "exported crypto," a hearsay claim, and happening to find
&gt; &gt;                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; &gt; It is an admission against interest and a confession; it is admissible 
&gt; &gt; against the speaker in a prosecution against him for "exporting crypto"
&gt; &gt; from a strictly evidentiary standpoint.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; one or more laptops at my home, weeks or months later, implies nothing. (To
&gt; &gt; &gt; make the point graphically, suppose the raiding party finds _several_
&gt; &gt; &gt; laptops or notebooks...do they assume _all_ were taken out of the country,
&gt; &gt; &gt; or do they pick the one with the most incriminating software on it? Answer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unless they can _prove_ one of them was used, and that it had not been
&gt; &gt; &gt; _changed_ since the putative event (highly unlikely), they cannot simply
&gt; &gt; &gt; _assume_ one of them was taken out.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your understanding of evidence is inaccurate.  The evidence re the 
&gt; &gt; laptop[s] would be admissible and the parties would argue about what it 
&gt; &gt; meant.  The jury is entitled to draw common sense inferences.  That might 
&gt; &gt; be easy to do in a case in which a defendant has confessed....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Seems to me to be an open and shut case. "Oh, _that_ laptop? That's not
&gt; &gt; &gt; the one I took to Europe."   "Oh, you say this laptop has PGP 5.9 on it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; So? I installed it last week. My trip to Europe was last summer.")
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So now you, as your own lawyer (apparently) have decided to take the 
&gt; &gt; stand and testify.  Remember that the prosecutor gets to cross-examine 
&gt; &gt; you.  Things are about to get ugly.... 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Considering the headaches required for airline travel today, it's not like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there aren't serious records abound.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Such as? I recall no inspections of my luggage, no inventorying of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; serial numbers of my laptops, no inspection whatsoever of my
&gt; &gt; &gt; magneto-optical drives (which were in my carry-on luggage, and not even
&gt; &gt; &gt; glanced at, in the box they were in). X-rays would not prove what was taken
&gt; &gt; &gt; in or out of the country, even if "x-ray escrow" were implemented (which it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not, according to all reports I have heard, and based on some practical
&gt; &gt; &gt; limits on storage), I doubt the records of a trip, say, last summer (of
&gt; &gt; &gt; '95) could be retrieved and prove that a particular laptop was taken out.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not to mention that the software allegedly taken out might have been on any
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of media, none of them distinguishable with an x-ray machine.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Circumstantial evidence is admissible if probative of a fact at issue in 
&gt; &gt; the case.  Evidence that you took a laptop out of the country is 
&gt; &gt; probative of the allegation that you exported crypto using a laptop.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For crying outloud, he admitted to the world that he took the software
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out.  I put that in front of a jury and it looks just like the typical
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "For crying out loud" is bluster, not legal argument.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And your understanding of evidence shows a misunderstanding of how the 
&gt; &gt; rules of evidence actually work in a courtroom. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;stupid bragging criminal.  Any defense about "I was just kidding" or "The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;message was forged" might be interesting, but it will sound like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;technical-mumbo-jumbo to a jury.  Yes, it would convince &gt;ME&lt; that was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Legal proof is still needed. Given only a nebulous statement like "I
&gt; &gt; &gt; exported crypto in violation of the ITARs," or "I shipped PGP to Europe,"
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not enough for a case even to be brought to trial.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You are absolutely wrong.  It may not be enough for a conviction, but it 
&gt; &gt; will beat a Rule 29 motion (Motion for a judgment of acquittal) and get 
&gt; &gt; the case to the jury.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (If it reached trial, I would expect a defense attorney to move for
&gt; &gt; &gt; dismissal. Absent any evidence that a crime occurred, absent any proof
&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond the nebulous hearsay statement of a "braggart," there is simply no
&gt; &gt; &gt; basis for criminal action.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Stupid bragging criminals" may be common, but bragging is not in and of
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself illegal. There still has to be evidence of a crime.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Must a jury believe that you were "just bragging" because you now, in a 
&gt; &gt; criminal trial, say that you were? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Produce the body."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perry Mason is only active in re-runs.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (I can say I personally whacked Jimmy Hoffa. Absent other evidence, or the
&gt; &gt; &gt; body, or witnesses, does this mean I'll be found guilty? To use BU's
&gt; &gt; &gt; phrasing, "for crying out loud.")
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's where prosecutorial discretion comes in and a judge's and jury's 
&gt; &gt; common sense comes in if the prosecutor runs amok.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; BTW, I am far more willing to believe you were bragging about whacking 
&gt; &gt; Jimmy Hoffa than about exporting crypto.  Think of all the interesting 
&gt; &gt; evidence from this mailing list's archives that prosecutors would attempt 
&gt; &gt; to introduce against you ...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not to say that *I* couldn't get you off, but not the way you propose.
