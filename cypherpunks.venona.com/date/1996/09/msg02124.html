Something to think about before any of us start selling Ketchup on-line via
E-cash...

&gt;  Brave Old World:
&gt;  Reflections on Europe in the Digital Age
&gt;  by Steven Carlson; 20 Sep 1996
&gt;  ------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;  ** So Much Fuss About A Bottle Of Ketchup
&gt;
&gt;  Hungarian police recently sent a fax around to the local Internet
&gt;  service providers (ISPs) asking them to provide lists of their users
&gt;  in Esztergom, a small town outside of Budapest. It seems somebody
&gt;  had planted a bomb in a bottle of ketchup. Since everyone knows you
&gt;  can download bomb-making instructions from the Internet, the police
&gt;  figured they should investigate the local users. No, I'm not making
&gt;  this up.
&gt;
&gt;  What's more, nearly every local ISP gave the police this information.
&gt;  Fortunately my company has no users in Esztergom and so that's what we
&gt;  told the police. We got off lucky. Believe me, as much as might want
&gt;  to make a stand for privacy of information my company is NOT eager to
&gt;  do battle with the Hungarian authorities.
&gt;
&gt;  But that's what it might take. Because if the Hungarian police really
&gt;  understood the Internet they could have asked for even more. For
&gt;  example, it would only take a few keystrokes to forward a users' mail
&gt;  to the authorities. The police might also have asked for old email,
&gt;  since many ISPs back this up routinely.
&gt;
&gt;  But that's not all. Some ISPs run caching servers, machines that store
&gt;  frequently-viewed webpages so that users access them locally rather
&gt;  than across the net. An ISP's caching server could give the police a
&gt;  profile of what web pages the users have been browsing.
&gt;
&gt;  I'm not trying to scare anyone. My point is that sharing information
&gt;  on the Internet is a two-way street. Computers keep extensive records.
&gt;  Using the Internet often means you leave a trail behind you. This is
&gt;  part of life in the digital age.
&gt;
&gt;  This "electronic trail" is not unique to the Internet. Every time you
&gt;  use a credit card you create a record in several computers. Other
&gt;  computers may be storing information about you such as your medical
&gt;  history, driving record, tax filings and so on. The more we rely on
&gt;  computers to manage our affairs, the more information that may be "out
&gt;  there." This means citizens in the digital age should know their
&gt;  rights.
&gt;
&gt;  Many governments already have laws to protect private information. For
&gt;  example, the US has many laws restricting access to sensitive
&gt;  information such as medical and credit records. You might be surprised
&gt;  to know Hungary passed a law in 1991 to prevent misuse of information
&gt;  associated with the national identity card.
&gt;
&gt;  Yet the growth of new technologies is outpacing legislation. For
&gt;  example, Holland and other countries are experimenting with "smart
&gt;  road" systems that can identify the licence number of a moving car for
&gt;  purposes of toll collection. Cellular phones and satellite navigation
&gt;  systems can report the locations of their users. It's not difficult to
&gt;  imagine how these and other technologies could be abused.
&gt;
&gt;  Of course, now you know that even your local Internet provider has
&gt;  access to some rather sensitive information about you. This leads me
&gt;  to ask: what sort of service is your Internet provider actually
&gt;  offering?
&gt;
&gt;  When it comes down to it, your ISP is like your doctor, your lawyer,
&gt;  your accountant or your psychiatrist. Each of these professionals
&gt;  deals with your data; each profession is governed by a code of ethics,
&gt;  written or implicit. Moreover these limits are codified in law. If
&gt;  your accountant allowed your competitors to read the company books,
&gt;  you could take him to court.
&gt;
&gt;  Similarly, your Internet provider has an implicit duty to protect the
&gt;  privacy of your communication. Most professionals in my industry
&gt;  recognize this. I know most of the people working in Hungarian
&gt;  Internet and I doubt very much that they are reading your mail or
&gt;  mine. But they don't know where they stand in the eyes of the law.
&gt;
&gt;  Internet professionals should certainly assist the police in a
&gt;  legitimate investigation. But should every Internet user in Esztergom
&gt;  be investigated just because they could (theoretically) find
&gt;  bomb-making information on the Internet?
&gt;
&gt;  To hammer that point home a local Internet-based magazine has
&gt;  published, in Hungarian, complete bomb-making instructions:
&gt;  &lt;<A  HREF="http://www.idg.hu/internetto/cyber/special/dinamit.htm">http://www.idg.hu/internetto/cyber/special/dinamit.htm</A>&gt;. In other
&gt;  words, if you've read this far you may be the subject of a future
&gt;  investigation. Have a nice day!
