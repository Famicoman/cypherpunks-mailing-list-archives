&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; We've all heard these arguments, but are they true?  Who says so, and how

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tried on a consistant, large, scale.  When all conventional alternatives
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have been tried and fail, what have we or the starving children got to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; lose?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I think "Lord of the Flies" answers this question quite well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does it?  LOTF was fiction.  Can you identify a recent instance in which a
&gt; &gt;non-governmental organization attempted to influence political/military
&gt; &gt;events via a concerted AP?
&gt; 
&gt; As you understand, I really have to question anybody who would take an 
&gt; extraordinarily contrived work of fiction like LOTF and exrtrapolate from it 
&gt; as some sort of "answer" to AP.  However, Unicorn is sufficiently confused 
&gt; that it's not surprising that this would come from him.
&gt; 
&gt; While it's been well over two decades since I read it, LOTF engages in the 
&gt; artifice of separating out a handful of near-pre-adolescent boys, who don't 
&gt; seem to get along particularly well while stuck on an island after being 
&gt; shot down during a war.  (Presumably, WWII.)  It's hard to understand what 
&gt; kind of lesson we could learn from this, particularly since one person's 
&gt; opinion of what might happen should such an extraordinary and unlikely event 
&gt; occur can't be all that more significant or valuable than another.  
&gt; 
&gt; Or, what if such an event actually happened, and the outcome was quite 
&gt; different?  What would that say about Golding's opinions?   Or, suppose a 
&gt; similar event occurred, but instead of a dozen boys it was a co-ed college's 
&gt; students, or a few geriatrics, or a family, or a few middle-aged women, 
&gt; or...what?    What, exactly, are we learning from one specific speculation 
&gt; that Golding happened to want to commit to paper?
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately (or, perhaps _fortunately_?) I don't think we're going to hear 
&gt; from Unicorn why he thinks one particular dime novel is any more 
&gt; revelational about human behavior than any other.

Your "grasp" of literature gives the list my answer without me having to
say a word.

I notice you chose to ignore the factual political examples I gave.  Not
that this surprises me.  "Your" concept, of rule by terror, has thousands
of examples in historical context.

I simply refuse to debate the matter any longer as it is clear you are not
open to reasoned debate, nor, it would seem, are you clearly possessed of
reason.
