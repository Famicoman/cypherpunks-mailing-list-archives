&gt; Okay, this is the story.  I just received a strange telephone call.
&gt; My caller ID system shows only 'OUT_OF_AREA-----000-----'.  The female
&gt; voice claimed to be taking a survey for the Department of Defense and
&gt; that she was acting as a representative of my government.  She did not
&gt; say US Government or State Government, just 'your government'.
&gt; When I said that there was no way for me to verify she was what she
&gt; claimed, she gave me a business name, supervisor's name and an 800
&gt; telephone number.  She claimed this survey had to do with a Department
&gt; of Defense program named 'YATS' and told me that if my household did
&gt; not qualify, then our telephone number would be removed from the
&gt; calling list.  She then ask the same question three different ways.
&gt; The question was 'Is there anyone in your household between the ages
&gt; of 16 and 24?'.  When I said no for the third time, she said we did
&gt; not qualify and hung up.
&gt; So here are my questions.
&gt; Was this a legitimate call?  The government should already know
&gt; exactly how many people are in my household.  It is on my tax forms
&gt; every year and many other places.
&gt; Why would any government office or representative of a government
&gt; office be making cold calls to unknown telephone numbers for any kind
&gt; of survey?
&gt; Who or what is 'Westat'?  This is the name of the company this woman
&gt; supposedly represented.
&gt; The telephone number given to me is 1-800-638-8778.  The same woman
&gt; answered it as called me.  Seems like a company doing a survey for the
&gt; government would have more than one employee.  Her supervisor's name
&gt; is Chris Martin.  Is she Chris Martin?  In a single person office, I
&gt; guess you would be your own supervisor.  The woman never gave her
&gt; personal name.
&gt; This survey was supposed to be for the Department of Defense for a
&gt; program named 'YATS'.  What is YATS?
&gt; My biggest question is, Is this a new face on an old scam?  Instead of
&gt; posing as the local fire department looking for donations, are the
&gt; scam-artist now posing as the government?  What a way to case a home
&gt; in preparation for theft or running yet another scam of questionable
&gt; legality.  Yes, I am a very suspicious person.  I have seen too many
&gt; scams being run.

My GTE WATS line for internet is 800-638-xxxx, so maybe they're related.
