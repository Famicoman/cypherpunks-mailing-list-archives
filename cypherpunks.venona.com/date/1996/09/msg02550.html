	The actions they claim they will do will, of course, lead to no
results whatsoever in many cases... as it should be. The hotline in question
sounds like a number as opposed to an email address... pity, we could just
bounce all spam to it and ask them to deal with it.

&gt;   LONDON (Sep 23, 1996 3:48 p.m. EDT) - The British government Monday
&gt;   set up a watchdog to try to get pornography off the Internet.
   
&gt;   Safety-Net, which is being financed by the industry, will have a
&gt;   hotline to which callers can report suspected illegal material and
&gt;   will contact police if necessary.

	Being financed by the industry = if you're going through a British
ISP, you're paying for it whether you like it or not.

&gt;   It will publish a "legality indicator" or rating for each public
&gt;   access area on the Internet known as a Usenet news group. The rating
&gt;   will indicate whether the group normally contains illegal or
&gt;   pornographic material and what kind.
   
&gt;   Internet users can contact the hotline to complain about material
&gt;   received from anyone via an automatic telephone, mail, e-mail or
&gt;   facsimile.
   
&gt;   Safety-Net operators will try to see where the material came from,
&gt;   contact the authors and ask them to remove it. They can ask the
&gt;   relevant service provider to take action and pass details to the
&gt;   British Police National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS).
   
&gt;   "We at the Home Office (interior ministry) made it clear to the
&gt;   Internet providers some time ago that action was needed to deal with
&gt;   obscene material on the Internet," Home Office Minister Tom Sackville
&gt;   said.
   
[...]

&gt;   Science and technology minister Ian Taylor said Safety-Net would act
&gt;   as a warning system to alert the public.
   
&gt;   "As this is an international network, we have to do something to try
&gt;   to eliminate illegal use of it -- the abuse of the Internet by a few
&gt;   perverts," he told BBC radio.
   
	As this is an international network, this is completely impossible.

&gt;   "Government and the Internet industry have been working hard to come
&gt;   up with proposals that can offer real protection to net users while
&gt;   preserving free speech and recgonizing the value of the net for work,
&gt;   education and leisure," Taylor added in a statement.

	Usual government doubletalk.... preserving free speech means no
such actions.
