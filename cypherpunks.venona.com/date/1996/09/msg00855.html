&gt;SCIENTOLOGISTS FIGHT FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION ON NET
&gt;Police investigators in Helsinki say the Internet "anonymous remailer" site
&gt;anon.penet.fi was shut down partially because of a copyright dispute with
&gt;the Church of Scientology (and not because the site was a primary conduit
&gt;for child pornography, as was previously reported).  The Church of
&gt;Scientology, which has been successful in convincing the courts that its
&gt;teachings are validly copyrighted material, was pursuing an individual who
&gt;used the anonymous remailer site to post Scientology texts without the
&gt;Church's permission.  The operator of the site decided to close it down
&gt;rather than reveal the individual's name to Helsinki police.  The Church
&gt;says it was not opposing the existence of the server:  "We have no
&gt;opposition to there being anonymity for private, consensual communications.
&gt;What we oppose is using anonymous servers for the purpose of permitting
&gt;criminal or other unlawful acts."  (New York Times 6 Sep 96 C2)

	Why don't I believe the first portion of that statement?

&gt;COPYRIGHT LAW ARCHIVED ON THE NET
&gt;The Stanford University library is working with the Council on Library
&gt;Resources to compile an electronic archive of information on copyright law
&gt;in an effort to keep educators and others aware of the ongoing debate over
&gt;the "fair use" doctrine.  The Stanford site &lt; <A  HREF="http://fairuse.stanford.edu">http://fairuse.stanford.edu</A> &gt;
&gt;contains the full text of court decisions, legislation and international
&gt;copyright agreements, as well as related articles on the topic.  (Chronicle
&gt;of Higher Education 6 Sep 96 A42)

&gt;NEW ANGLE ON WEB SURFING
&gt;BroadVision's new Web site, called The Angle, features the company's
&gt;One-To-One intelligent agent and WebPoint content management technologies.
&gt;"What intranets are looking for are ways to help users of their site get
&gt;information they need, and are entitled to, quickly and efficiently without
&gt;too much surfing," says the company's CEO, who touts his service as an
&gt;efficiency-booster for corporate technology managers.  Unlike its rival,
&gt;Firefly, which is used to direct music seekers to selections they might like
&gt;based on similar buyers' tastes, the One-To-One agent software is built on
&gt;rule-based reasoning.  BroadVision is considering licensing Firefly's
&gt;technology, which uses a personalization algorithm to identify trends among
&gt;users and personal tastes, to expand its offerings.  (Interactive Age

&gt;CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS, TO RESOLVE COPYRIGHT ISSUES
&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is shifting gears in its drive to
&gt;resolve electronic copyright issues, and is now working with members of
&gt;Congress to develop a legislative solution to the issue of online service
&gt;provider liability, which has been a sticking point in efforts to pass new
&gt;copyright legislation.  "We are looking for a way to define the nature of
&gt;the provision of mere telecommunications services, for which
&gt;telecommunications providers should bear no liability for copyright
&gt;infringement.  We are trying to define where the dividing line is between
&gt;someone who actively engages in the provision of information versus someone
&gt;who is a mere conduit," says a senior legal counselor for the PTO.  The PTO
&gt;originally believed these issues could be resolved through the court system,
&gt;but now says it will work with Congress and industry to develop legislative
&gt;solutions.  (BNA Daily Report for Executives 4 Sep 96 A4)

	Eeep... I trust the courts more than people selected by a popularity
contest. Remember that various of the worse CDA-replacement bills had in
them provisions for CDA-like filtering being protected from liability? To
me, that's a pretty clear government sponsorship of such filtering, which
makes it censorship.

&gt;WHERE WIZARDS STAY UP LATE
&gt;The NY Times Sunday Book Review says the Hafner/Lyon book on the origins of
&gt;the Internet ("Where Wizards Stay Up Late") compiles a great deal of
&gt;much-needed information and "shows just how striking an innovation and
&gt;collaboration the Arpanet really was.  One central focus of the book
&gt;(excerpted in the Sep/Oct Educom Review) is the contribution of the
&gt;brilliant psychologist and computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider, who
&gt;predicted an era when "human brains and computing machines will be coupled
&gt;.... tightly, and ... the resulting partnership will think as no human brain
&gt;has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the
&gt;information-handling machines we know today."  (New York Times Book Review 8
&gt;Sep 96 p19)
