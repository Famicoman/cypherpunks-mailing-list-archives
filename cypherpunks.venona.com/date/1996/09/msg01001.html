&gt;From:	Chuck Thompson , a True Believer, inquired:
&gt;
&gt;What in the devil are you trying to say?  Maybe I'm one of those stupid
&gt;citizen units.  I just don't get it - I'd like to, but I don't.  How about
&gt;rephrasing your comments so that us average citizen units can understand
&gt;your wisdom.
&gt;...........................................................
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well then I'll spell it out for you:
&gt;
&gt;.  I actually said that it is "a government" which will posture as
&gt;sympathetic towards the whiningH^H^H^H^H^Hconcerns of citizens.   
&gt;
&gt;.  Political candidates very well know that citizens (voters) are looking for
&gt;someone to save them from what ails them.  Therefore many candidates will
&gt;make the right statements about upholding similar values. They start making
&gt;sounds like they are going to "do something about it" (about whatever the
&gt;latest issue is).    And their supporters will like these sounds.   Reagan
&gt;made a quote about this sometime, something like:   "They may not hear the
&gt;lyrics, but they hear the music."   The voters feel good because they expect
&gt;that their discomfort will be taken care of.   Therefore they vote for the
&gt;candidate most positive towards their needs.   The candidate is elected to
&gt;the office for which they are running and thereby achieve their goal.
&gt;
&gt;.  The more that voters seek the attention of government assistance for their
&gt;myriad problems, the more that the sphere of government involvement in the
&gt;details of everyone's daily lives enlarges.  This enlargement of the
&gt;government sphere of involvement, as encouraged by citizens, expands as
&gt;people find more things to complain about.   The more personal control over
&gt;their problems which they abdicate to the government, the more control it
&gt;accrues.  
&gt;
&gt;.  Of course a government does not want to appear to be in totalitarian
&gt;control.   Many citizens do want *someone* to be in control, however.  They
&gt;want a benevolent overseer to be in control.  As the scope of benevolent
&gt;services, as controlled by government, spreads out across the land, many
&gt;people are happy that someone is in control.
&gt;
&gt;.  Some people are so happy about benevolent government control that they
&gt;want it extended towards things like their own moral preferences.   Any time
&gt;that they see the evidence of anything contrary to their own moral
&gt;preferences, they want these visible signs of contrariness removed.  Moral
&gt;preferences and how they relate to national circumstances are a tricky
&gt;subject for governors and legislators.   But if it makes the citizens happy
&gt;and keeps the governors in office, they are willing to oblige in removing
&gt;these offenses by pursuing the "offenders".
&gt;
&gt; .  Reducing the expressions of these offenders helps the governors, because
&gt;it enhances their position of control.  It helps to legitimize their
&gt;activities and again enlarges their arena, their domain, of command.   They
&gt;can become quite meticulous in determining what may or may not be expressed
&gt;or said which might be offensive to someone - in particular, to themselves
&gt;(because it may weaken their image of being benevolent and "in command" of
&gt;the situation).
&gt;
&gt;.  At that point, anyone who can think in the abstract will be able to see
&gt;that, as expression derives from thought, that what is wrong therefore with
&gt;all of the "offenders" is their thoughts.  That is why TC May called this
&gt;kind of offense the equivalent of "thought crime".  There is a book about
&gt;"thought crimes" against the State which you may have heard about, though you
&gt;may not have read.
&gt;
&gt;.  Thought and its relationship to the State is a deep and complex
&gt;philosophical subject.  There are many posts in the cpunk archives which can
&gt;provide you with insights into the anarcho-capitalist libertarian position.
&gt;
&gt;.  If you need any more details on "thought criminality", maybe Tim can
&gt;answer them for you, as he's the one who brought up the subject.  I was
&gt;merely agreeing with him.  &lt;g&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   ..
