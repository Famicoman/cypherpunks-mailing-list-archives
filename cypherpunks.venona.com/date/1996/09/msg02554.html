	Note the usual misuse of the term "hacker."
      
&gt;   (Sep 28, 1996 02:18 a.m. EDT) -- One or more hackers using racist and
&gt;   other hate terms have erased tens of thousands of messages used by a
&gt;   wide variety of political discussion groups on the Internet, exposing
&gt;   new concerns about the security of the worldwide computer system.
   
&gt;   At least one Internet customer -- in Oklahoma -- has been blamed for
&gt;   some of the more than 30,000 killed messages and has been cut off by
&gt;   his service provider.
   
&gt;   "Obviously, the individual responsible is no longer around here," said
&gt;   William Brunton, president of Internet Connection of Tulsa, one of
&gt;   several service providers of Usenet news groups that were victimized
&gt;   during the weekend. "You can be assured it's not going to happen again
&gt;   from here."

	The author really doesn't understand USENET, does he (or she)?
Evidently, one of the persons posting the cancels was doing so out of this
company.
  
&gt;   He said he had turned information over to federal authorities and
&gt;   could not comment further.
   
&gt;   In Washington, D.C., an FBI spokesman declined to confirm whether the
&gt;   matter was being investigated although it was unclear what, if any,
&gt;   laws may have been violated.

&gt;   The messages were deleted from system discussion sites used by gays,
&gt;   Jewish groups, Muslims, feminists and other politically oriented
&gt;   groups.
   
&gt;   The perpetrator or perpetrators used so-called "cancelbot" software
&gt;   programs labeled with such phrases as "fagcancel" and "kikecancel."
   
&gt;   Besides Brunton's small Oklahoma firm, Internet service providers
&gt;   whose discussion groups were victimized included industry giants
&gt;   Netcom Inc. of San Jose, and UU Net Technologies of Falls Church, Va.
&gt;   Officials of those firms were not available for comment.

	And operating out of these? Or is it simply that the groups in
question are carried by these firms?

&gt;   While some believed such attacks pose a serious threat to the sanctity
&gt;   of the Internet -- which is virtually unregulated save for a generally
&gt;   adhered-to protocol known as "netiquette" -- others were less alarmed.

	Usual mixup between USENET and the Internet, of course.
   
&gt;   "There actually are no laws against that sort of thing," said Jonah
&gt;   Seiger, policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology in
&gt;   Washington, D.C. "Obviously, it's sort of annoying."
   
&gt;   He said a cancelbot, or a forged cancel message, is "a malicious
&gt;   vehicle and not good netiquette."

[...]

&gt;   Two years ago, when some immigration lawyers "spammed the net" --
&gt;   electronically plastering news groups throughout the Internet with a
&gt;   single message, an advertisement telling how to get a green card --
&gt;   "it was the first time someone figured out you could cancel those
&gt;   messages," Seiger said.
   
&gt;   Since then, phony cancelbots have appeared with some frequency. In one
&gt;   of the better-known cases, the Church of Scientology used cancelbots
&gt;   to erase messages from news groups used by some of its members with
&gt;   whom the church was engaged in a legal battle.
   
&gt;   The security of the Internet has also been brought into question
&gt;   recently after hackers altered home pages operated by the CIA and the
&gt;   Justice Department.
