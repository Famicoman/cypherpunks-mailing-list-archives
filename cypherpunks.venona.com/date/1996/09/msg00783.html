&gt;PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 SEP 6 (NB) -- By Richard Bowers.  
&gt;By the year 2000, consumers, businesses, governments, and 
&gt;educational institutions worldwide will use electronic cash (e-cash) 
&gt;for nine billion payment transactions. According to a new study by Killen 
&gt;&amp; Associates, this increase in e-cash will pose a great threat to some of 
&gt;the biggest institutions in the world. 
&gt;
&gt;The report specifically highlights the risk to the retail and banking  
&gt;industries. Speaking to Newsbytes, a spokesperson for Killen said that 
&gt;the report, which will be issued later this month, gives little solace to 
&gt;the problems facing traditional retail companies. The report does 
&gt;however, say that the banks can regain the leadership position in 
&gt;payments by moving quickly to leverage their payment transaction 
&gt;infrastructure to fully support e-cash. 
&gt;
&gt;"By 2005, e-cash transactions will escalate to almost 30 billion,"  
&gt;stated Michael Killen, president of the market research firm. "Banks 
&gt;must act quickly to leverage their position in payment services. Non- 
&gt;banks see this as a new opportunity to carve further market share 
&gt;away from the banking industry. All will compete for new revenue 
&gt;streams including Internet-based micropayments." 
&gt;
&gt;The report uses a very broad definition of e-cash including among  
&gt;others; secured debit cards, phone cards, electronic checks, ATM 
&gt;transactions, point of sale loans, and automated tolls. 
&gt;
&gt;Using this broad definition they estimate that in 1995 there were 536  
&gt;billion non e-cash transactions worldwide compared to only 1 billion 
&gt;e-cash transactions, or about .0019 percent. By the year 2005, of a 
&gt;total estimated 1 trillion transactions, the report predicts 3 percent 
&gt;or around 30 billion transactions will be e-cash. 
&gt;
&gt;"The impact of e-cash will be widespread on both banking and  
&gt;commerce," Killen added. "Opportunities will open for financial and 
&gt;other product and services players, including ATM vendors such as 
&gt;NCR, Diebold, and IBM; credit card authorization firms, including First 
&gt;Data, Total Systems, Equifax, and National Data; ATM/POS terminal 
&gt;manufacturers and network suppliers, including bank-owned 
&gt;networks, American Express, Deluxe, ACS, and VeriFone; and cash 
&gt;handling/cash management services firms such as ADP, GEIS, National 
&gt;Data, and Brinks. Software firms that understand the enormous 
&gt;system integration opportunities of adapting legacy systems to on- 
&gt;line, secured environments will also benefit from the need to support 
&gt;e-cash transactions." 
&gt;
&gt;The report will include forecasts of the overall payments environment  
&gt;and the impact of e-cash on cash, checks, credit cards, and other 
&gt;electronic payment systems though the year 2005. It will also have a 
&gt;section on the opportunities for new business, dislocations, and 
&gt;threats to existing businesses, with emphasis on acquisition and 
&gt;alliance opportunities. 
&gt;
&gt;"E-cash provides the necessary payment options to support new and  
&gt;low-cost products and services, including micropublishing," Killen 
&gt;continued. "Information services such as AC Nielsen, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 
&gt;and Wall Street investment and advisory firms will fill their clients' 
&gt;needs for customized news. This will lead to a new understanding of 
&gt;personal and commercial buying patterns, wants, and needs. 
&gt;Individual consumer purchase, transaction, and life-style profiles will 
&gt;be developed. Advertisers can then use this information to target 
&gt;market-customized advertising and marketing programs."
