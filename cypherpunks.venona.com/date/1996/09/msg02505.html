I have to agree with the final Quote....I am Good in math, chemistry and 
computer science I am good in any Logical cource but I have trouble in 
places liek " Creative Writing" I take all AP cources and make A's and 
B every now and again in english...I have a 3.7 gpa but a LOW sat in the 
grammar and english sections, 1100 in all I don't think colleges should 
look at the subjects you dont plan to major in...I plan to major in 
computer science when I go to college, so I dont think they should look 
so much at say english, or biology.  I get so frustrated in some of those 
classes....BTW I am a Junior in highschool

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I hate to burst any bubbles but, the school with the highest number

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Public High School (Jefferson High in Fairfax, VA)
&gt; &gt; &gt; The same is true for Montreal (Royal Vale) using the equivalent scoring methods.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But there are public schools at both extremes of the curve.
&gt; &gt; &gt; While it is true that Private Schools would not survive due to market forces if
&gt; &gt; &gt; they did consistently poorly, it is also true that they filter their incoming
&gt; &gt; &gt; student body in a manner that Public Schools can not.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want to refuse those who are too stupid or anti-social from Public
&gt; &gt; &gt; Schools in order to improve the social or intellectual climate, you better have
&gt; &gt; &gt; a solution for the resulting cast-offs.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;      There is a solution. Trade Schools, and Parental Envolvement. It could 
&gt; &gt; very well be (and if I had the money I'd make the bet) that _many_ of the 
&gt; &gt; "troubled" youth of today are simply undisiplined. (Fortunately, most of 
&gt; &gt; them couldn't afford to bet against their parents in an AP world). It would
&gt; &gt; also seem to follow that if parents were spending their own money (or 
&gt; &gt; perceived it as their own money) that they would take a greater interest in
&gt; &gt; their childrens education.
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;       For those that are truly not scholastically oreinted, there would be
&gt; &gt; trade schools. I would also bet that you could teach a child everything they
&gt; &gt; need to learn (other than a trade) to cope in this world in about 4 years. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But now we must make a disinction... I'm LD in writing, but can read very
&gt; well (when I was in 6th grade I could read like a 10th grader), and do
&gt; very well in Math and Computer classes (and non-biological/anatomical
&gt; sciences).  So should I be in trade school, because I plan on being a
&gt; computer programmer, or go to college?  Sure, I don't do well in language
&gt; and (depending on the class) some history classes, which, IMHO, are
&gt; weighted more heavily than they should be in both public _and_ private
&gt; schools (and yes, I've been to both), but I don't think that should mean I
&gt; can't go to college...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, my point is that there is, at times, a very fine line...
&gt; 
&gt;  --Deviant
&gt; When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.
