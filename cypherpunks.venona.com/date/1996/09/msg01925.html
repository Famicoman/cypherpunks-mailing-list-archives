	(By this sort of thing, I was refering more to the privacy
apps 'integrated with Claris EMailer and Eudora,' which you go on to
discuss.  I think that a remailer client needs to be integrated with
the usual mail tools, not seperate.)

	I agree, especially if we write a protocol that allows a user
to connect to a mixmaster, get a pool of messages, and remail them on
to their destanation, along with a message of his own.  (This is a
half baked idea; there are obvious denial of service issues, as well
as reliability issues in the well intentioned cases.)
