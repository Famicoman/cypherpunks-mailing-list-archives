Dear Sir,

RE: Our Clients: Demon Internet Limited and Mr Clive
Feather

We  act on behalf of Demon Internet Limited and Mr  Clive
Feather  both of whom were the subject of articles  which
appeared  on  the  front page and  on  page  19  of  your
newspaper in the edition of Sunday, 25th August.

In  the  offending article you have represented that  our
clients  are "Pedlars of child abuse" and are "Key  links
in   the  international  paedophile  chain".   You   have
represented  that both our clients actively  support  the
supply  of  paedophile  material.   This  allegation   is
entirely  false  and  is  a most serious  and  outrageous
libel.    Our   clients  are  most  distressed   by   the
publication  of  the  offending  statements   which   are
inaccurate and grossly defamatory of them and which  will
cause   damage   to   their  goodwill   and   reputation,
professionally,  commercially  and  socially.   Both   Mr
Feather  and Demon Internet Limited have been the subject
of  serious  expressions  of  concern  and  outrage  from
various of the readers of your newspaper.

The  damage that you have done to our clients cannot,  of
course,  be  undone but it can be mitigated.  We  require
that  you mitigate the serious damage that has been  done
to  our clients by publishing the enclosed letter from Mr
A W Mudd, Chairman of Demon Internet Limited.

You  were  well  aware, when you decided to  publish  the
false  article in question, of the damage that  would  be
caused  to our clients which is already very considerable
and  which  will  form the basis of a claim  for  special
damages.   It is open to you to mitigate that substantial
loss  at the earliest possible time by publishing a  full
retraction and apology in this coming Sunday's edition of
your newspaper.



We  shall, within the next week or so, issue a  Writ  and
deliver  a  Statement  of Claim.   In  the  meantime,  we
reserve all our clients' rights in the matter and nothing
contained  in this letter or in the enclosed letter  from
Mr  Mudd  shall be regarded as a diminution or waiver  of
those rights.

Yours faithfully,

JEFFREY GREEN RUSSELL

Dear Sir

THE PEDLARS OF CHILD ABUSE

Banner headline: Front page and Page 19 : Sunday 25th
August 1996

I refer to your articles on the front page and page 19 of
last Sundayís paper.  I regard these as highly defamatory
as well as a poor piece of journalism that
sensationalises a serious issue and clouds fact with
emotion.

I am appalled and outraged that The Observer has printed
such a misleading, abusive and inaccurate article -
giving the impression to readers that Clive Feather and
Demon Internet are the "Pedlars of child abuse".  This
libellous reporting, littered with malicious lies not
only defames the good character and reputation of a
valued employee, but also destroys the genuine efforts
Demon Internet has been making in
conjunction with the police and the DTI to deal
effectively with the problem.

The articles clearly aimed at sensationalism at any cost
with the intention of misleading readers by stating that
our employee is an "Internet abuser" immediately after
using the word "paedophiles".

As the UK's largest provider of Internet access, Demon
has taken the lead in discussions with all relevant
parties and is in the process of announcing restrictions
to illegal material and processes to classify content,
enabling users to monitor and report on what is viewed.
Demon Internet is also the first European Internet
Service Provider to deliver Microsoft's new browser
software, 'Internet Explorer' which incorporates a
classifications standard.  Demon Internet has been taking
action to ensure that the Internet in the UK has informed
and appropriate legislation guarding the interests of
users.

This report not only confuses an extremely complex and
sensitive issue but also smears the integrity of an
honourable, family man. Demon Internet is committed to
eliminating this scourge from this new and rapidly
expanding market. The Internet is bringing great benefit
to millions of users not least your own journalists.  For
you to pick on
one aspect in total isolation and present it in such a
lurid fashion, does not help the DTI, the police or
ourselves who are genuinely striving to solve the issues.

Would you please publish this letter in your edition of
1st September.    Your unreserved apology and full
retraction, to be given as great prominence as your
original articles, would also be greatly appreciated

Yours faithfully,




A W Mudd
Chairman
