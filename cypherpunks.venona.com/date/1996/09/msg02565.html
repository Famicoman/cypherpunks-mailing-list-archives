&gt;   BRUSSELS (Sep 29, 1996 00:12 a.m. EDT) - European Union
&gt;   telecommunications ministers, reacting to a child-sex scandal in
&gt;   Belgium, pledged Friday to consider ways to keep illegal material that
&gt;   could harm children off the Internet.
   
&gt;   Belgian Telecommunications Minister Elio Di Rupo announced that his
&gt;   government planned to implement new measures requiring Internet access
&gt;   providers to monitor and report material featuring sexual abuse or
&gt;   exploitation of children.
   
&gt;   He asked his colleagues to join forces with him.
   
&gt;   "Today a big legal vacuum exists, for legislation is falling behind
&gt;   technological evolution," he said, according to a speaking note that
&gt;   was distributed to reporters.
   
&gt;   "There is a big risk that it will create an enormous market of
&gt;   children fed on by criminals."

	Market? Wider distribution of such pictures will lead to _decreased_
production, for the simple reason that the producers won't be able to go to
courts for stopping copyright violations, so they can't make any money.
   
&gt;   The ministers agreed to expand a working party that has already been
&gt;   set up to look at the question of illegal material on the Internet and
&gt;   asked it to come up with concrete proposals before they meet again in
&gt;   November.
   
&gt;   The group will include representatives of the 15 EU telecoms
&gt;   ministries and of companies that provide access to online services or
&gt;   prepare the content, a statement adopted by the ministers said.
   
[...]

&gt;   But some of the telecoms ministers, including those from Britain and
&gt;   Sweden, warned that the EU could not wander into censorship and had to
&gt;   focus on fighting truly illegal material.
   
&gt;   British Science and Technology Minister Ian Taylor advocated a
&gt;   self-regulatory system that was announced in his country earlier this
&gt;   week.
   
&gt;   Two British trade associations announced that an independent body, the
&gt;   Safety Net Foundation, would be established to rate material carried
&gt;   on the Internet and to set up a "hotline" service to receive
&gt;   complaints about illegal material.
   
&gt;   They said Internet service providers would also adopt policies for
&gt;   removing illegal material and reducing the scope for subscribers to
&gt;   act with untraceable anonymity.

	I suspect that any anonymous remailers operating in Britain may want
to look out for ISP interruptions...
   
&gt;   Swedish Communications Minister Ines Uusmann told reporters that EU
&gt;   countries needed to exchange ideas and to speak with one voice in
&gt;   tackling a global problem.
