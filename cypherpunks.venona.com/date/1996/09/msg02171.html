Re: below whimpering/whining/sniveling.
Why don't you guys learn to use your computers?
People who write this stuff must be thinking something like:
"Gee, that cypherpunks list has SO much good info on it, I can't stand 
to not keep track of what's going on there.  But those occasional 
irritating posts just upset me so much, I can't deal with it, so I 
better get it off of my chest and tell everyone.  Oh, I feel so much 
better now, maybe they'll let me go home today."

&gt; &gt; While some folks would rather we talked only about "crypto," just
&gt; &gt; how many times can basic questions about Diffie-Hellman, or RSA, or 
&gt; &gt; elliptic curves be discussed?

&gt; I think a better question is "do we need to have to make sure people
&gt; are posting for the sake of posting? Why must we have a charter broad
&gt; enough to generate too much volume to allow conversation?"
&gt; Sure, there is a limit to what can be said about cryptography and the
&gt; direct politics of cryptography. *THAT IS THE POINT*. That is why I'm
&gt; starting a new list -- so that I can abandon this waste heap to those
&gt; that like frolicking in the mire.

&gt; &gt; And as I was there at the initial planning meeting in July of '92,
&gt; &gt; and then at the first physical meeting, I can assure you that what
&gt; &gt; soon became "Cypherpunks" was never intended to be an announcement
&gt; &gt; list for research discoveries in mathematical cryptography!

&gt; No. It was intended for discussion of cryptography *and* the politics
&gt; of cryptography. Not theories about some airliner was shot down by
&gt; aliens, not random musings on "assasination politics". The idea was
&gt; never to be restricted just to the technical aspects of cryptography,
&gt; but the notion was to have a place where the non-technical discussion
&gt; also was on *cryptography*. This list no longer has *any* charter. A
&gt; posting on sexual practices in Botswana is probably as "on topic" as
&gt; anything else these days.
&gt; The new list, however, will have a charter, and it *will* be enforced.

&gt; &gt; Much as some have been shrilly claiming "This list is for crypto and
&gt; &gt; programming discussions only," this was *never* the intent.

&gt; Tim, I hate to say this, but cypherpunks is a sewer which has driven
&gt; off anyone seriously interested in the area, and you are part of the
&gt; reason.

&gt; &gt; The serious crypto researchers, e.g., the Matt Blazes, the Whit
&gt; &gt; Diffies, and the Carl Ellisons of the world, have various channels
&gt; &gt; they use to communicate in.

&gt; For those who can think back a few years, this *used* to be one of
&gt; those fora. No longer, of course. This is not for people serious about
&gt; anything. I no longer read 99% of what is posted here -- its drek.
&gt; I do not believe it would be good, however, for the list to be shut
&gt; down, because there have to be sewers to carry the world's
&gt; intellectual waste products, and if this list did not exist the likes
&gt; of Jim Bell and the others would be out causing harm on other mailing
&gt; lists.
&gt; PS Still looking for a solid site that can host a 1500 member
&gt; significant volume mailing list without choking.
