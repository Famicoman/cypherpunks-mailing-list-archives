Personally, I paid my way through uni...full fees. I took out a loan 
when I developed cancer to pay  for it (as the health insurance was 
not finalised for aproval - so they got out of paying). The few 
months I was unemployed after I left the military because of a 
confict of interests I earned money by doing whatever I could get 
(even though I am an engineer I have worked in a petrol station). So 
why and for what reason sould I have to pay several 10's of thousands 
each year to support others. I have never taken help from the 
govenment, I do not feel I should have to pay as well.
And what am I paying for...to protect the status quo. I believe that 
there is more than enough help for ppl available. They just need to 
get off their butts and work.

&gt; &gt; &gt;"Saving for a rainy day," whether saving, investing, getting an education

&gt; &gt; commitment. If those who save and prepare are then told they have to pay
&gt; &gt; high taxes to support those who partied....well, the predictable effect 
&gt; &gt; [...] is _more_ people in agony. When you tell people that a compassionate
&gt; &gt; society will meet their basic needs, a predictable fraction of them will choose
&gt; &gt; not to work hard and prepare themselves.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Two questions, two observations:
&gt; &gt; Do you have health insurance?
&gt; &gt; Do you have life insurance?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, so?
&gt; Yes, so?

Myself also yes,yes 

&gt; &gt; I have commented on your line of reasoning before and and it still
&gt; &gt; seems to me that an important part of the discussion is missed.
&gt; &gt; Specifically, that anyone can "save for a rainy day" and still not be
&gt; &gt; able to provide for events that can always happen: Heart attack, stroke,
&gt; &gt; car accident, pinched nerve that leaves you in excruciating pain and
&gt; &gt; unable to work for several years.
&gt; 
&gt; Understand what it is you are saying.
