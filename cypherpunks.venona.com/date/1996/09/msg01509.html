&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You are saying that everyone on the planet has a right to health
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insurance and disability insurance whether they can afford it or not.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is folly.  The result is serious moral hazard problems.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Almost, but not quite. I'm saying that within our two countries at least
&gt; &gt;&gt; (Canada, U.S.) everyone could have access to medically necessary
&gt; &gt;&gt; procedures because the *society as a whole* can afford it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The decisions about what is or is not medically necessary must by
&gt; &gt;design be made by government in a socialized medicine regime.
&gt; 
&gt; People do make decisions that affect other people. If you feel safer in the good
&gt; hands of Allstate than at the government trough, good for you.

I feel safer in the hands of the market where Allstate is but one
insurance carrier.

&gt; Personally, I trust in Allah, but I still tie up my camel. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This evades an important point as well.  Namely, who cares if society
&gt; &gt; can afford it?
&gt; 
&gt; Some things are seen as investments in the future of a society. I view both
&gt; Education and Health through this lens.

I'd like to hear the argument for Health.
I'd like to hear the argument for Education- particularly one which makes
socialized education systems the only, or even a good answer.

&gt; &gt;&gt; But there is a balance between accurately pricing the risk and
&gt; &gt;&gt; minimizing the cost of the bureacracy that polices this pricing. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh, I see.  Let's give the program to the government then.  Good idea.
&gt; &gt; That will reduce the cost of the bureacracy.
&gt; 
&gt; The point is still valid. Are we not trying to minimize this cost?

Now explain how government will reduce bureacracy and minimize cost
please.  Cite, if you will, a few examples.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There are also many ways to modify behaviour, not all of them direct. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And all of them buy into the notion that people are not to be made
&gt; &gt; personally responsible for their high risk behavior.
&gt; 
&gt; There it is again. Blame the sick for their lack of moral fibre.

Blame the rich for their condition.
 
&gt; Not every victim of lung cancer smokes.

I'll tell you what.  I will give you a dollar for every non-smoking
related lung cancer case, if you give me one for every smoking related
case.

&gt; Besides, people are notoriously poor at
&gt; evaluating the probability of unlikely events (see reference below). A
&gt; "punishment" that happens 30 years after the "crime" is no deterrent.
&gt; Prevention is usually cheaper than treatment. 

And now please describe how government and socialized medicine are better
at preventing lung cancer.

&gt; &gt; I prefer market solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; I prefer solutions.

Now please explain how government provides a superior solution.
