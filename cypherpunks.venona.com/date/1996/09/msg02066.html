	The current occupant of 10 Downing street simply contributes
	to the problem --by trying to enforce 400+ years of unsuccessfull
	rule. &lt;&lt; Logically, the British ought to figured out by now that 
	they aren't welcome now, and never were welcome in Ireland, but
	then, they aren't noted for their logic. &gt;&gt;

&gt; 	It is suprising that someone from the press has not seized upon Jims

	The idea was first proposed 200 + years ago. Computer technology
	simply makes it easier to implement.

	And the press in that day had a hard time dealing with it,
	because in denouncing it, they spread the idea that maybe
	it is a good thing.   Ignored, it becomes forgotten.  Denounced,
	it becomes a cause celebre.

&gt; like Markof are somewhat more responsible. This is not going to stop me
&gt; from producing an op-ed piece linkiing the net libertarians to assasination

	Do that op-ed piece --- but remember that AP is not a libertarian
	position. Libertarian's think that government is a good thing.
	AP thinks that government is a bad thing, and their philosophical
	differences get wider, from there.
