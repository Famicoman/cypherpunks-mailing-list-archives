	Unfortunately, they're only using DES - probably because they do serve
international customers.

&gt;   (Sep 6, 1996 01:17 a.m. EDT) -- It's written in almost every computer
&gt;   instruction manual and technical guide. It's encouraged, sometimes
&gt;   even mandated, by MIS lords. Yet it's almost universally ignored.
   
[...]

&gt;   Fortunately, just before the drive when south I had taken up an offer
&gt;   from a company called Connected Corp., of Framingham, Mass., which
&gt;   markets an appealing product called DataSafe.
   
[...]

&gt;   DataSafe is an on-line data backup system. You load the DataSafe
&gt;   software onto your computer then connect via the Internet to
&gt;   Connected's data center. The system asks for a credit card number and
&gt;   a password of your choosing. Once done, DataSafe searches your hard
&gt;   drive, identifies every data file, and uploads them to the DataSafe
&gt;   computer. The system doesn't back up your applications, such as your
&gt;   copy of WordPerfect; just the data files you've created with the
&gt;   software. DataSafe stashes your stuff in two separate computers to
&gt;   ensure nothing is lost.
   
[...]

&gt;   But a dead hard disk works wonders on one's powers of concentration.
&gt;   With all my original data gone, it was time to find out whether this
&gt;   DataSafe really worked. I reinstalled the DataSafe software onto my
&gt;   new hard drive, made the connection with Connected, and waited to
&gt;   receive my files. No dice. I'd forgotten the password. And Connected
&gt;   refused to give it to me or provide me with a new one. That's because
&gt;   the backed-up data is encrypted, and the password is the key. Even the
&gt;   folks at Connected can't crack the encryption without your password.
&gt;   They designed the system that way to reassure customers that nobody
&gt;   can tamper with the data stored there.
   
[...]

&gt;   But many, perhaps most, people can't afford to lose a fragment of
&gt;   data. For them, on-line data backup systems like DataSafe may be the
&gt;   answer. The company charges $14.95 a month to store 50 megabytes of
&gt;   data. The software can be set to automatically back up all new and
&gt;   modified files every day whenever you choose.

[...]
  
&gt;   Businesses can use the system as an inexpensive data network. Just
&gt;   create an account, then give the password to everybody in your
&gt;   company. Now you can store commonly-used files on the backup server,
&gt;   where they can be downloaded by anyone who needs them.
   
&gt;   Connected isn't the only company that has figured this out. MCI Corp.
&gt;   is selling an Internet-based data backup service. So is McAfee
&gt;   Associates, the maker of anti-virus software. Many people will
&gt;   hesitate to store their computer files with a stranger, encryption or
&gt;   no encryption. But if that makes you uneasy, imagine how you'd feel if
&gt;   your hard disk crashed. Unless you're a columnist, it could be a
&gt;   disaster.
