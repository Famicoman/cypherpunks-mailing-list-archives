&gt;Looks like a really nice paper on anonymity issues; at 485K, it'll take
&gt;a little while to read :-)

Yes, it was quite a load, but very good material.

&gt;
&gt;The fundamental difficulty in this problem is that you need some
&gt;demonstrable proof of uniqueness for human users; if you don't have that,
&gt;you can't transform it into a unique-but-anonymous identity.*
&gt;The issues are similar to privacy-protecting voter registration problems.
&gt;
&gt;Brands's protocol starts with the user going to the bank with proof of ID,
&gt;and getting a numerical ID which can be blinded and signed.
&gt;It's a nice approach; you can do cruder approaches by hashing your
&gt;universal-citizen-unit-ID-number or whatever, but that can be
&gt;dictionary-searched
&gt;by feeding all the possible ID numbers through the hash.
&gt;
&gt;For some applications, mapping back to a unique human isn't necessary;
&gt;if you do something like map back to a bank account which has a high
&gt;minimum balance for setup, this discourages the type of users who
&gt;don't want to spend $100 just to send spam.
&gt;
&gt;Blinding a Verisign signature isn't enough, though - they support
&gt;personna certificates without proof of identity.

Is it possible to determine the level of Verisign signature to screen out
personna certificates?

&gt;
&gt;[ * There are non-universal-identifier methods for preventing double-use.
&gt;Voter registration in many places just depends on identification and
&gt;affidavit, and is often abused (e.g. Chicago graveyard voters and
&gt;Nevada absentee ballots), but usually not massively abused.
&gt;Some third-world countries don't even require registration or literacy -
&gt;they dip your thumb in ink after you vote, using a kind of ink that
&gt;won't come off for a couple of days.  Attacks against this protocol
&gt;include better solvents :-) ]

Of course, if elections were very infrequent, they could cut off a finger
each time you vote :-)

You all have given me much to think about.

Thanks.
