&gt;Join us for a great evening at MIT, Building 6, Room 120 for the latest ISIG
&gt;meeting.  Here's the scoop on the main presentation which starts at 7 pm:
&gt;
&gt;"So Says I**": Financial cryptography, microintemediation and the power of
&gt;reputation in a ubiquitous geodesic economy.

&lt; Actually, "I" is "Joe Nebuchannezar" ;-), RAH&gt;

&gt;(That really means there's a whole lotta' shakin' goin' on in the area of
&gt;electronic money!)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;** "I" is Bob Hettinga, the founder of the Digital Commerce Society of
&gt;Boston, and resident man with opinions on most aspects of e$$
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Obviously, the net is going to give us the ability for anyone, anywhere, to
&gt;buy anything.  No matter where the buyer or seller is, or, for that matter,
&gt;where the thing being sold is.
&gt;
&gt;However, financial cryptography, the technology which underlies digital
&gt;commerce, will have much more profound implications than merely the
&gt;simplification of sales and distribution. It permits us to make anonymous
&gt;*cash* transactions for everything from a billion-dollar foriegn exchange
&gt;trade to possibly even switching internet packets themselves.
&gt;
&gt;If this promise is kept, it could change the fundamentals of our entire
&gt;society. It forces profit and loss responsibility further and further down
&gt;into organizations until they break up into smaller competing operating
&gt;units. It makes book-entry transactions like checks or credit cards
&gt;obsolete, and replaces them with strange stuff like digital cash and
&gt;personal digital bearer bonds. It creates cash-settled auction markets for
&gt;practically anything. People joke about routers and switches which save up
&gt;enough from their traffic-tolls to buy copies of themselves. About
&gt;micromoney as processor food.
&gt;
&gt;On a macroeconomic scale, all of government's revenue sources are
&gt;book-entry taxes, like those on sales, income, and capital gains. "What
&gt;happens when taxes become a tip?", some people have asked. That is, if
&gt;government can't trace transactions anymore, because of the very way those
&gt;transactions executed, how will government be funded?
&gt;
&gt;Disintermediation is a common buzzword in the financial markets. It is
&gt;usually meant to describe what mutual fund companies have done to banks.
&gt;What happens when mutual funds become microintermediated?
&gt;
&gt;In this talk, we'll look at all of this, and what the world might look like
&gt;if Moore's Law and strong cryptography do manage to create a geodesic
&gt;economy.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From 6:30-7pm, we had expected to have a demonstration of Black Diamond's
&gt;web video software, but we haven't quite solved the technical details...(it
&gt;is active X, and we can't get that on a UNIX machine yet ;)  )  I am still
&gt;expecting that one of their representatives will be joining us.  We will
&gt;also have the usual Q&amp;A during that time.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't know where Building 6 Room 120 is, the simplest way to describe
&gt;it follows:
&gt;
&gt;Go to the main entrance of MIT on Mass Ave and walk up the steps into the
&gt;domed building.  Go straight ahead into the long hall ("the infinite
&gt;corridor".)  Keep walking until you reach the sign that says Building 6,to
&gt;the right.  Turn down the hall to the right until you reach room 120 on your
&gt;right.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Marianne
