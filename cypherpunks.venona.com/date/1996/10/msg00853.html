News Release (Netscape): Monday, October 7, 1996

Netscape to Use CyberCash Technology

Netscape Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) and CyberCash, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CYCH) today announced a technology and marketing relationship to broaden
payment options for Internet consumers. As part of the agreement, CyberCash has
licensed its CyberCoin Internet payment technology to Netscape. Netscape will
bundle its technology into future versions of Netscape products, including
Netscape LivePayment server software for online payment processing.

The two companies will also collaborate on including future CyberCash payment
services, such as CyberCash's electronic check services, into future Netscape
commerce offerings. Netscape and CyberCash plan to jointly market these
Internet payment solutions to consumers and businesses, and will work together
on efforts to accelerate the deployment of Secure Electronic Transactions (SET)
credit card payment protocol in the marketplace.

"We have had customer demand for small value payment technology particularly
from the professional information publishing industry -- the integration of
CyberCash's CyberCoin with Netscape's commerce solutions provides our customers
with a way to complete small transactions over the Internet," said Srivats
Sampath, vice president of marketing for server, tools and applications at
Netscape. "By offering a range of payment options for businesses and consumers,
Netscape and CyberCash will help expand the range of goods and services
available in the electronic marketplace."

"Combined with Netscape's customer base, CyberCoin is filling a need in the
marketplace for small payment processing," said Denis Yaro, executive vice
president, products and operations at CyberCash. "This is a huge step in our
efforts to bring Internet transaction technology to consumers and businesses
and to increase online inventory, making the virtual mall a reality."

"We are pleased to see this agreement between Netscape and CyberCash," said
Chuck White, senior vice president of First Data Card Services Group's
Electronic Funds Services unit. "The relationship between Netscape and
CyberCash will make it easier to deliver integrated payment solutions to our
client financial institutions, and their merchant customers that are using
Netscape LivePayment."

CyberCoin is a payment service which permits online purchases for items costing
between 25 cents and $10.00. This new payment solution opens up significant
opportunities for merchants to market low cost, high value items such as news
and information, graphics, games and music. It also allows merchants to
unbundle larger product offerings, and sell them in smaller increments.
Financial institutions to offer the CyberCoin service include First Union Bank,
First USA Paymentech, Michigan National Bank and First Data Corp.

Bundling CyberCash's CyberCoin technology into future releases of Netscape's
LivePayment point-of-sale software will enable online businesses to accept
multiple payment methods and implement new pricing and business models.
Netscape LivePayment will integrate this new payment functionality seamlessly
and cost-effectively, providing business people with administration and
configuration controls with flexible logging reports, and a variety of sample
merchant applications to minimize the start-up development costs of merchants.
Both Netscape and CyberCash will market Netscape LivePayment software to
businesses looking to develop or expand online distribution channels.

Netscape plans to integrate CyberCoin into future versions of Netscape
Navigator client software, which includes technology that streamlines
consumers' shopping experience by providing a uniform interface for Internet
purchases and transactions. Similar to a real wallet, this technology will
organize into one place a user's credit card numbers, shipping addresses,
digital IDs, electronic receipts and other payment instruments needed to
purchase goods and services on the Internet.

Netscape and CyberCash will coordinate their efforts on SET to assure
interoperability between their credit card-related electronic commerce
implementations. Netscape was one of the principal architects of the SET
specifications proposed by Visa International and MasterCard International.
Committed to being among the first to deliver SET-compliant products to the
marketplace, both Netscape and CyberCash will also collaborate with other
important industry leaders in an effort to facilitate SET's arrival in the
shortest possible timeframe. About Netscape Netscape Communications Corporation

(NASDAQ: NSCP) is a leading provider of open software for linking people and
information over enterprise networks and the Internet. The company offers a
full line of clients, servers, development tools and commercial applications to
create a complete platform for next-generation, live online applications.

VeriFone Introduces Personal ATM and VeriSmart

VeriFone, Inc., Monday announced plans to bring the convenience of a bank
automatic teller machine into the homes of millions of consumers around the
world, enabling them to replace cash and access dozens of personal services
anytime, anywhere, using telephones, televisions, personal computers and other
low-cost devices and information appliances.Announced Monday at the ABA Bank
Card Conference, VeriFone unveiled plans to introduce a low-cost, palm-sized,
smart card reader/writer called the Personal ATM (P-ATM). The P-ATM will
connect to any standard telephone line, allowing consumers to interact with
their bank account to download cash,' securely and conveniently in the privacy
of the home or office.

In addition, leveraging VeriFone's leadership in Internet commerce, the P-ATM
will also interface with the VeriFone vWallet, and any stored-value card
scheme, enabling consumers to make purchases over the Internet, download funds
from their bank onto their smart card, transfer funds between accounts, and
perform on-line transactions between consumers and merchants. VeriFone also
revealed the development of the VeriSmart System architecture, which is
expected to accelerate consumer adoption of smart card applications. The
VeriSmart System will integrate a low-cost personal ATM device, a powerful set
of software applications that lets consumers securely interact with any
provider offering smart card services, and a comprehensive package of support
services.

Applications might include the ability to download electronic cash from their
bank, instantly receive rewards from loyalty programs, or provide selected
healthcare information to their doctor or pharmacist.

Six leading technology companies -- CIDCO, Gemplus, Key Tronic, Mondex
International, Scientific Atlanta and WebTV Networks, Inc. -- have announced
their support for VeriSmart and plan to work with VeriFone to develop further
technologies around the system.

"We are taking an aggressive role in developing the infrastructure for smart
card applications with our plans to introduce the Personal ATM and the
VeriSmart System," said Hatim Tyabji, chairman, president and CEO of VeriFone.

"VeriSmart will be the first technology that is card-scheme and hardware-device
independent, uniting all the elements in a truly end-to-end solution. We plan
to actively layer VeriSmart technology into our merchant point-of-sale
terminals and Omnihost client-server systems, to create solutions that bridge
all VeriFone markets worldwide. This action unveils the third element in our
three pronged strategy -- traditional debit/credit business, Internet commerce
and now consumer smart card technologies -- expanding VeriFone's leadership in
secure payments technologies worldwide."

In addition, American Express, GTE, Hewlett-Packard Company, MasterCard, NIPSCO
Industries, Inc., Sparbanken Bank (BABS), Sears Payment Systems (SPS), and
Wells Fargo have all announced support of the VeriSmart System.

The VeriSmart System is being designed to electronically link consumers to
their banks, telephone and utility companies, retail merchants and other
personal services. Using any one of a variety of smart card-ready devices, such
as the Personal ATM, telephone, PC, or set-top-box, a consumer will access
numerous personal services and interact with multiple stored-value card
schemes, loyalty programs, identification, and health care information.

The VeriSmart System will provide end-to-end security for all communications
between the access device and the smart card applications on the VeriSmart
server, ensuring data integrity of financial transactions and other
confidential information.

"This is the beginning of a new era for smart card applications," said Tom
Kilcoyne, general manager of VeriFone's Consumer Systems Division.

"The industry has been waiting for a compelling, cost-effective solution that
enables financial institutions, and a broad range of consumer service
providers, to move aggressively to build smart card applications. Endorsement
in the consumer market from these respected companies, combined with VeriFone's
global leadership position and expertise in the secure payment transaction
market, supports our belief in VeriSmart as a powerful system that can
accelerate development of the market for smart cards worldwide."

Wide Industry Support VeriFone's Consumer Systems Division's effort to enhance
the market for smart cards is drawing the support of consumer market leaders
that will contribute in pivotal areas of the system.

CIDCO Inc., the world's leading producer of subscriber terminal equipment that
supports intelligent network services being offered by telephone operating
companies, has formed an alliance with VeriFone to incorporate VeriSmart
technology into its products and to work with VeriFone on future projects.

"CIDCO is excited to be collaborating with VeriFone in the explosive consumer
smart card market," said Paul Locklin, CIDCO president and CEO. "The VeriSmart
system brings a strong added value to the products we market to our regional
Bell operating company customers." "VeriFone and Gemplus have had a close and
long-standing relationship over the years and we are proud to be part of this
latest breakthrough solution," said Marc Lassus, Gemplus CEO. "As a market
leader, our strategy has been to partner with companies that enable us to offer
the best-of-breed solutions, and our participation in VeriSmart extends this
strategy to the consumer market for smart cards."

"As consumers become more accepting of smart cards, initiatives like VeriSmart
will make it easier for banks and other institutions to introduce new products
and services that provide greater choice and convenience," said Ruann F. Ernst,
general manager of HP's Financial Services Business Unit.

Bankers Hope to Control 'Electronic Cash'

By E. SCOTT RECKARD

The largest organization of U.S. banks wants "smart cards" and "electronic
cash" limited to the banking industry.

The American Bankers Association, in its first official position on how
electronic cash should evolve, says such "stored-value" cards should be issued
only by regulated institutions with direct access to Federal Reserve payment
services -- namely banks, thrifts and credit unions.

The bankers' recommendation comes as several software companies are also
jockeying to provide payment systems over the Internet.

At a convention here, the bankers trade group warned that users of prepaid
phone cards have been ripped off by fly-by-night issuers. The same could happen
in storing funds for general use on plastic cards like credit cards or in
computers, the bankers said in issuing their report Sunday.

"If a nonbank issuer of stored value fails, consumers could be left holding the
bag - an empty bag," said James M. Culbertson, president for the past year of
the ABA and chairman of First National Bank in Asheboro, N.C.

The bankers' group acknowledged that some day computer companies may get into
the business of electronic cash. But if that happens, banks want the computer
companies to be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny that applies to banks
and thrifts.

While seeking exclusive rights to smart cards and their ilk, banks have
resisted the idea that conventional bank regulations should apply to electronic
cash. They oppose a proposal to apply the Federal Reserve's "Regulation E" to
stored-value cards. That regulation requires banks to offer written
confirmations of ATM transactions. Bankers say such a requirement would make
stored-value cards too expensive to issue.

And in pilot projects, banks have not treated the smart cards as deposits that
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That means the consumer does
not earn interest on the unused cash backing up the card and the banks do not
have to set aside reserves as they would for a conventional deposit.

A smart card has a computer chip that stores information, including how much
the consumer has deposited. As a purchase is made, the amount is automatically
deducted from the balance in the card's memory.

In the future, consumers will be able to transfer cash to smart cards from
their home computers or at an automatic teller machine at a bank. Electronic
money is also being tested to pay for purchases over the Internet.

The move away from paper-based transactions has been a boon in many ways for
banks. The replacement of manual check-processing by electronically stored
images of the checks has probably paid off more for banks than any other
high-tech innovation, bank technology consultant Charles O. Hinely said in an
interview.

But banks could be pushed out of the payment system altogether if they don't
quickly get into computerized services and transactions, said Don Tapscott,
author of "The Digital Economy."

"If you don't, you're basically toast, and punishment is swift," he told the
bankers.

The trade group's new president, Walter A. Dods Jr., said he would work to
improve the image of bankers, whom he described as unfairly maligned despite
the financial support and considerable charity work they provide their
communities.

"But what do we get in return? We get legislation to limit ATM fees. We get a
reader telling Business Week recently that 'banks are just sucking us dry,"'
said Dods, the chairman of First Hawaiian Bank.
