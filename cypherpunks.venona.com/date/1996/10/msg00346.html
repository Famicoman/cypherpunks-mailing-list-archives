&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;failing areas.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't do a lot of nit-picking on this mailing list, but:
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am a Jew. *You* are a gentile. So are all the rest of the mormons.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Get this point straight.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Uh, in Utah, Jews are Gentiles. No lie.
&gt;
&gt; I hope I can add something useful to this:
&gt;
&gt; There are quite a few religious groups which claim Zionist spinoff
&gt; beliefs.  Rastafarians (spelling OK?), Mormons, Jews, Christians, and
&gt; probably a host of others.  Some of these groups specifically exclude
&gt; others who make similar claims.  There is good evidence that the Jews,
&gt; to name one example, did not originally (whenever that was) make claim
&gt; to being a Chosen People, etc., but added it later.  Certainly Mormons
&gt; and other Christians "added it later", no question about that.
&gt;
&gt; St. Paul in the Christian "new testament" makes it quite clear that, at
&gt; least from his time onward, the value of being a Jew is in the spirit,
&gt; not in the flesh.  Deep stuff, indeed.
&gt;
&gt; Then there's the question of how one obtains the "right to exist" as an
&gt; ethnic identity, hopefully without having to exterminate someone else.
&gt; I for one was raised in a very conservative Christian culture, and we
&gt; were taught that God "gave" Canaan (later Israel) to the Israelis, when
&gt; it was already occupied.  Refer to Dick Gregory's comments about
&gt; Columbus "discovering" America, and how he should be able to go downtown
&gt; and "discover" himself a Cadillac.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, in a review of HP products I once read (they made the first
&gt; personal computers, circa 1966 I believe), it said that HP people, in
&gt; their main plants in Corvallis OR and Ft. Collins CO, had a really great
&gt; "work ethic", and that they were almost all Mormons and "born again"
&gt; Christians.  That probably says more about homogenous culture than about
&gt; any particular culture, I would guess.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line for me is, I sincerely appreciate a lot of the good values
&gt; some of these religions bring to their followers, but let's be serious,
&gt; if any of these groups get too much power, look the *hell* out!
&gt;
&gt; P.S.  I cringe every time I hear one of the CNN bozos pronounce Israel
&gt;       as in real estate, or get real.  I think they all have to attend
&gt;       the Rick Dees school of broadcasting, so it's a standard, like
&gt;       GAK or something is going to be the standard.
&gt;
&gt;

What is the crypto-relevance of the above-quoted passage?
