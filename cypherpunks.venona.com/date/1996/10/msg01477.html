	I seem to recall someone predicting that China and other such countries
would set up an internal net with strict controls. Good prediction... I wouldn't
be surprised to see Cuba recruited to it, for instance, although North Korea
doesn't appear likely (too insular).

&gt;      Copyright © 1996 Reuter Information Service
      
&gt;   BEIJING (Oct 21, 1996 10:25 a.m. EDT) - A China-wide computer network
&gt;   launched by a subsidiary of the official news agency Xinhua on Monday
&gt;   will take Chinese businesses online and supply them with news and
&gt;   economic information, company officials said.
   
&gt;   The China Wide Web (CWW) created by China Internet Corp would provide
&gt;   Chinese customers with online services in their own language and would
&gt;   give overseas subscribers a window on to the Chinese business world,
&gt;   company chairman Ma Yunsheng said.

	I've about concluded that we'll see a Web dominated by two languages -
English and Japanese. It's very hard for native speakers of Indo-European
languages to learn Japanese, it's very hard for native speakers of Japanese
to learn English, and no other such language has a prosperous-enough home
country to work. Such internal nets may alter this, however...
   
[...]

&gt;   In January, Xinhua was appointed the government regulator for foreign
&gt;   suppliers of economic information in China, a role that some analysts
&gt;   say clashes with its involvement in enterprises that supply financial
&gt;   and business data.
   
[...]

&gt;   Unlike the open-access Internet, CWW was modelled on internal company
&gt;   networks or "intranets," Edelson said.
   
&gt;   "There will be a lot of real-time information available," he said. "I
&gt;   think there's going to be very fast growth from a zero start."
   
&gt;   China Internet would enjoy free use of Xinhua's communications network
&gt;   and already had access agreements with the powerful Minstry of Posts
&gt;   and Telecommunications, he said.
   
&gt;   Ma said domestic economic information would also be available through
&gt;   Xinhua news services and databases. He declined to say how many
&gt;   clients were expected to subscribe.

	Heavily edited domestic economic information...
   
&gt;   The Internet is viewed by some Chinese officials as a haven for
&gt;   pornography and political dissent but CWW would likely be a
&gt;   politically correct alternative.
   
&gt;   "CWW should reflect Chinese culture," technology officer Wong said,
&gt;   without giving details.

	Ah, yes, the old claim of cultural difference to try to justify
censorship. So Nazi Germany was due to a cultural difference?
