<PRE>
engines,
 it is becoming more and more difficult to be found among the MILLIONS of
 listings.  
 
 If you"re like the rest of us you have found it extremely frustrating.
You
 spend lots of time and money developing your site and then you're listed
 number 30, or 80, or even 200th.  You're NEVER FOUND.
 
 
                     ***************************
                             GOOD NEWS
 
 
 The good news is we have found a SOLUTION. After months of fighting the
 search engine battle we got LUCKY. 
 
 A programmer recently became associated with our firm who had done some
 CONSULTING WORK for six months with one of the major search engines. With
 his help we developed a REPORT on the major search engines and how they
 really work.
  
 
                    *****************************
 REPORT 
 
 His report is excellent. We have been using the material in the report
for
 over five months. IT WORKS!  With it, our sites are in the top TEN
listings
 on all major search engines and we have experienced a virtual stampede of
 people to the web sites.  
 
                      
 HITS ARE UP, SALES ARE UP, and most importantly, everyone is HAPPY.
 
 
                     ***************************
                             YOUR COPY
 
 
 Now, YOU CAN HAVE A COPY of his report.  In it you will find:
 
 
 
           How to vault in the TOP TEN  on any search engine using any
 keyword. Strategies that put you ahead of 95% of the other sites online.
 
            How to STAY in that TOP TEN.
 
            How to improve your chances of being found in about 10
MINUTES.
 
           How the search engines calculate CONFIDENCE ratings (and what
 that means to you).  
 
           Killer META TAGS that totally blow away your competitors.
 
           Which search engines are the very BEST FOR YOU.
 
           How to get your site REGISTERED for FREE at over 200
locations,
 in one easy step (it takes 10 minutes).
 
           How to BLOCK out part of your site from the search engines
(and
 why you should do it).
 
           The effect of REPEATING KEY WORDS. (good or bad?) What happens
 when you repeat them too many times?

 strategies that can broaden your audience and build high volume web
traffic

 We tell you exactly what to do and show you SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.  And it's

immediate use.

                          and even
 
           How to legally "steal" your competitor's web traffic and send
it

FIRST! 
 
 
                     ***************************
