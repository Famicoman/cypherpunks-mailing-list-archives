&gt;&gt; Just a heads-up about a current scam concerning numbers with "809" area 
&gt;&gt; codes.... spread the word!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL! This is a fraudulent message received the other day. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; "Subject: Unpaid Account
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am writing to give you a final 24 hours to settle your outstanding
&gt;&gt; account.  If I have not received the settlement in full, I will commence
&gt;&gt; legal proceedings without further delay.  If you would like to discuss 
this 
&gt;&gt; matter to avoid court action, call Mike Murray at Global Communications 
on 
&gt;&gt; 1-809-496-2700"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Subject: More Phone Scams
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The scam works basically like this: 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You get home and notice that the message light is blinking on your 
answering 
&gt;&gt; machine.  You listen to the message, which has several wrinkles, but the
&gt;&gt; best one is the caller asks you to call a number beginning with Area 
Code 
&gt;&gt; 809 to receive information about a family member who has been ill.  
(They 
&gt;&gt; may also tell you someone has been arrested, died, you have won a 
wonderful 
&gt;&gt; prize, etc.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In any event, concerned or curious, you make the call. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sometimes the phone is answered by someone who claims to speak broken
&gt;&gt; English.  (The idea is to keep you on the line to build up charges.)   
Or, 
&gt;&gt; sometimes you will just get a long recorded message.  The bottom line 
is, 
&gt;&gt; when your phone bill comes, you see this incredible charge, oftentimes 
more 
&gt;&gt; than $100.00!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Crooks are using the 809 numbers as "pay-per-calls" and to get around 
the US 
&gt;&gt; Regulations and 900 number blocking.  Every time you call the number, 
they 
&gt;&gt; get a greatly inflated rebate from the foreign phone company.  Since 809
&gt;&gt; numbers are in the Caribbean, they aren't bound by the US 900# 
regulations 
&gt;&gt; that require them to warn you of the charge and the rate involved, and 
also 
&gt;&gt; a time period during which you may terminate the call without being 
charged. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The newest twist to this scam is to page people using the 809 numbers.  
With 
&gt;&gt; the new area code changes, people unknowingly are returning these calls.
&gt;&gt; When the bill comes, there are HUGE charges for the calls. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My suggestion is that no matter how you get the message, if you are 
asked to 
&gt;&gt; call a number with an 809 area code that you don't recognize, DON'T 
RETURN 
&gt;&gt; THE CALL!  It is bad enough that the criminal is invading your privacy,
&gt;&gt; don't let them invade your wallet as well! 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Scams of this type are extremely hard to prosecute and since you did 
&gt;&gt; actually make the call, neither your local phone company or your long
&gt;&gt; distance carrier will want to get involved.  They'll tell you that they 
are 
&gt;&gt; simply providing the billing for the foreign company.  You end up trying 
to 
&gt;&gt; deal (over the phone) with a foreign phone company that feels they have 
done 
&gt;&gt; no wrong.  It can turn into a real nightmare!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please fwd this message to friends and let people be aware of it!
