The latest issue of RISKS has some info of Crypto interest.  The second one
may have been posted to the list, but the first is well worth reading.

&gt;Subject: A new attack on DES 
&gt;
&gt;You have recently referred in RISKS [18.50, 18.52] to the ingenious new
&gt;attack against public key cryptosystems developed at Bellcore. All the
&gt;published information on the subject (including Bellcore's press release)
&gt;stress that the attack is not applicable to secret key cryptosystems.  Well,
&gt;Eli Biham and I have just released a research announcement in which we show
&gt;that an extension of the attack can, under the same realistic fault model,
&gt;break almost any secret-key algorithm, including DES, multiple DES, IDEA,
&gt;etc. The attack on DES was actually implemented on a PC, and it found the
&gt;key by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
&gt;cleartexts.

&gt;
&gt;                 18 October 1996
&gt;                     (DRAFT)
&gt;
&gt;In September 96, Boneh Demillo and Lipton from Bellcore announced an
&gt;ingenious new type of cryptanalytic attack which received widespread
&gt;attention (see, e.g., John Markoff's 9/26/96 article in the New York Times).
&gt;Their full paper had not been published so far, but Bellcore's press release
&gt;and the authors' FAQ (available at
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html">http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html</A>) specifically state that
&gt;the attack is applicable only to public key cryptosystems such as RSA, and
&gt;not to secret key algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
&gt;According to Boneh, "The algorithm that we apply to the device's faulty
&gt;computations works against the algebraic structure used in public key
&gt;cryptography, and another algorithm will have to be devised to work against
&gt;the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key techniques." In
&gt;particular, the original Bellcore attack is based on specific algebraic
&gt;properties of modular arithmetic, and cannot handle the complex bit
&gt;manipulations which underly most secret key algorithms.
&gt;
&gt;In this research announcement, we describe a related attack (which we call
&gt;Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA), and show that it is applicable to
&gt;almost any secret key cryptosystem proposed so far in the open literature.
&gt;In particular, we have actually implemented DFA in the case of DES, and
&gt;demonstrated that under the same hardware fault model used by the Bellcore
&gt;researchers, we can extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof DES
&gt;encryptor by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
&gt;cleartexts.  The power of Differential Fault Analysis is demonstrated by the
&gt;fact that even if DES is replaced by triple DES (whose 168 bits of key were
&gt;assumed to make it practically invulnerable), essentially the same attack
&gt;can break it with essentially the same number of given ciphertexts.
&gt;
&gt;We would like to greatfully acknowledge the pioneering contribution of Boneh
&gt;Demillo and Lipton, whose ideas were the starting point of our new attack.
&gt;
&gt;In the rest of this research announcement, we provide a short technical
&gt;summary of our practical implementation of Differential Fault Analysis of 
&gt;DES. Similar attacks against a large number of other secret key cryptosystems
&gt;will be described in the full version of our paper.
&gt;
&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE ATTACK
&gt;
&gt;The attack follows the Bellcore fundamental assumption that by exposing a
&gt;sealed tamperproof device such as a smart card to certain physical effects
&gt;(e.g., ionizing or microwave radiation), one can induce with reasonable
&gt;probability a fault at a random bit location in one of the registers at some
&gt;random intermediate stage in the cryptographic computation. Both the bit
&gt;location and the round number are unknown to the attacker.
&gt;
&gt;We further assume that the attacker is in physical possession of the
&gt;tamperproof device, so that he can repeat the experiment with the same
&gt;cleartext and key but without applying the external physical effects. As a
&gt;result, he obtains two ciphertexts derived from the same (unknown) cleartext
&gt;and key, where one of the ciphertexts is correct and the other is the result
&gt;of a computation corrupted by a single bit error during the computation. For
&gt;the sake of simplicity, we assume that one bit of the right half of the data
&gt;in one of the 16 rounds of DES is flipped from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and
&gt;that both the bit position and the round number are uniformly distributed.
&gt;
&gt;In the first step of the attack we identify the round in which the fault
&gt;occurred.  This identification is very simple and effective: If the fault
&gt;occurred in the right half of round 16, then only one bit in the right half
&gt;of the ciphertext (before the final permutation) differs between the two
&gt;ciphertexts. The left half of the ciphertext can differ only in output bits
&gt;of the S box (or two S boxes) to which this single bit enters, and the
&gt;difference must be related to non-zero entries in the difference
&gt;distribution tables of these S boxes.  In such a case, we can guess the six
&gt;key bit of each such S box in the last round, and discard any value which
&gt;disagree with the expected differences of these S boxes (e.g., differential
&gt;cryptanalysis). On average, about four possible 6-bit values of the key
&gt;remain for each active S box.
&gt;
&gt;If the faults occur in round 15, we can gain information on the key bits
&gt;entering more than two S boxes in the last round: the difference of the
&gt;right half of the ciphertext equals the output difference of the F function
&gt;of round 15.  We guess the single bit fault in round 15, and verify whether
&gt;it can cause the expected output difference, and also verify whether the
&gt;difference of the right half of the ciphertext can cause the expected
&gt;difference in the output of the F function in the last round (e.g., the
&gt;difference of the left half of the ciphertext XOR the fault).  If
&gt;successful, we can discard possible key values in the last round, according
&gt;to the expected differences.  We can also analyse the faults in the 14'th
&gt;round in a similar way.  We use counting methods in order to find the key.
&gt;In this case, we count for each S box separately, and increase the counter
&gt;by one for any pair which suggest the six-bit key value by at least one of
&gt;its possible faults in either the 14'th, 15'th, or 16'th round.
&gt;
&gt;We have implemented this attack on a personal computer.  Our analysis
&gt;program found the whole last subkey given less than 200 ciphertexts,
&gt;with random single-faults in all the rounds.
&gt;
&gt;This attack finds the last subkey.  Once this subkey is known, we can
&gt;proceed in two ways: We can use the fact that this subkey contains 48 out of
&gt;the 56 key bits in order to guess the missing 8 bits in all the possible
&gt;2^8=256 ways. Alternatively, we can use our knowledge of the last subkey to
&gt;peel up the last round (and remove faults that we already identified), and
&gt;analyse the preceding rounds with the same data using the same attack. This
&gt;latter approach makes it possible to attack triple DES (with 168 bit keys),
&gt;or DES with independent subkeys (with 768 bit keys).
&gt;
&gt;This attack still works even with more general assumptions on the fault
&gt;locations, such as faults inside the function F, or even faults in the key
&gt;scheduling algorithm.  We also expect that faults in round 13 (or even prior
&gt;to round 13) might be useful for the analysis, thus reducing the number of
&gt;required ciphertext for the full analysis.
&gt;
&gt;OTHER VULNERABLE CIPHERS
&gt;
&gt;Differential Fault Analysis can break many additional secret key
&gt;cryptosystems, including IDEA, RC5 and Feal.  Some ciphers, such as Khufu,
&gt;Khafre and Blowfish compute their S boxes from the key material.  In such
&gt;ciphers, it may be even possible to extract the S boxes themselves, and the
&gt;keys, using the techniques of Differential Fault Analysis.  Differential
&gt;Fault Analysis can also be applied against stream ciphers, but the
&gt;implementation might differ by some technical details from the
&gt;implementation described above.

&gt;Subject: "Key Recovery" Replaces "Key Escrow" in Encryption Plan (Edupage)
&gt;
&gt;The latest government proposal for encryption software controls touts a new
&gt;approach called "key recovery."  This provision would allow law enforcement
&gt;officials to rebuild, or "recover" the mathematical key to encoded messages
&gt;with the help of third-party code-breakers.  The new policy reflects
&gt;suggestions made in a National Research Council report released earlier this
&gt;year.  Under the Clinton plan, encryption keys would be expanded from 40
&gt;bits to 56 bits in products to be exported, provided the company agrees to
&gt;the key recovery process.  In addition, authority to issue licenses for
&gt;overseas sales of such products would move from the State Department, where
&gt;they're handled as "munitions," over to the Commerce Department.  The
&gt;Business Software Alliance, however, is still not completely happy with the
&gt;compromise.  "We expect to go back to Congress," says a BSA spokeswoman.
&gt;"Although the announcement was clearly a step in the right direction, it's
&gt;not at all what the industry was looking for in its entirety."  (*Investor's
&gt;Business Daily* 17 Oct 1996 A4; Edupage 17 October 1996)
