I came across some interesting passages in the RAND Corp. study, An
Exploration of Cyberspace Security R&amp;D Investment Strategies for DARPA:
"The Day After ... in Cyberspace II", MR-797-DARPA.

<A  HREF="http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR797">http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR797</A>

The report describes the results of an exercise sponsored by the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) using the RAND "The Day After..."
methodology to elicit the views of participants on research and investment
strategies addressing the security and safety of systems and networks
supporting various U.S. physical and functional infrastructures. The
exercise was held on March 23, 1996 in Washington D.C., and involved
approximately 60 participants from government, universities, and commercial
industries involved with the U.S. information infrastructure.

Has this report been discussed on the list?

----------------
Is it possible to "sterilize" data passing through our telecommunications
systems?

Billions of bits of data pass through our national information
infrastructure each second. Some of those bits represent information about
individual citizens' login and password combinations, social security and
credit card numbers, account information, health status, and innumerable
other sensitive information items. Our nation has superb communications
monitoring tools, housed primarily in the National Security Agency.
However, the NSA is precluded by law from collecting information about U.S.
citizens. When incidents of "information warfare" are being waged against
U.S. systems, could key data flows be "sterilized" or "sanitized" by
computer hardware and/or software in such a manner that the NSA could help
monitor and track perpetrators in cyberspace without violating these laws?
This topic was raised during exercise discussions. We have not studied all
the relevant laws and regulations to assess whether such sterilization
measures would allow the power of NSA's analyses to be brought to bear on
telecommunications involving U.S. citizens, but perhaps the topic merits
further investigation. If so, what kinds of pattern detection and
replacement algorithms would suffice to accomplish this goal?


Sponsor development of an aircraft-like "black box" recording device

When a cyberspace security incident happens, it is often not detected in
real time, and the trail back to the perpetrator becomes lost. Could a
"black box" recording device be developed, to be attached to key nodes or
links of cyberspace systems, that would record every transaction passing
through that node or link during the last n minutes (where n=5 or 10, for
example)? If so, that record would be invaluable in tracing the source of
incidents, whether they are accidental or deliberately perpetrated.
Thousands of such systems would be required to cover key links or nodes;
could they be made robust, inexpensive, and ultra-reliable?
