-------- &gt; Clinton Ready for Exports of Data Codes &gt; &gt; By DAVID E.
SANGER &gt; &gt; WASHINGTON -- After several years of debate between the &gt;
computer industry and U.S. intelligence agencies, President &gt; Clinton
has decided to permit U.S. computer companies to export more &gt;
powerful data-scrambling software, but only if they establish a system
&gt; that will enable keys to the code to be obtained by law-enforcement
&gt; officials with a court warrant. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Several big computer companies, led by IBM, have agreed to the new
&gt; system, but many others, which have opposed past proposals by the
&gt; administration for data-scrambling policies, are likely to object. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; But the Clinton White House, like previous administrations, citing
&gt; national security issues and fears of foreign terrorists or
&gt; criminals, is loath to permit the export of some of the most
&gt; powerful data-scrambling software. 
&gt;
&gt; Their reason has chiefly been that intelligence agencies feared such
&gt; equipment would be used by foreign terrorists, drug cartels and
&gt; other criminals to hide transactions and communications. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Now, in a compromise, according to two senior officials in the
&gt; administration who have been deeply involved in the new policy, on
&gt; Jan. 1, U.S. companies will be permitted to export software that
&gt; encrypts, or scrambles, data using "keys" -- lengthy numeric codes
&gt; -- that are up to 56 bits long. 

(ooooo. 16 extra bits!)

&gt; Clinton has also decided to move the authority for exporting the
&gt; encryption software from the state department, which has had
&gt; export-licensing authority because the technology has been
&gt; classified as munitions, to the commerce department, which controls
&gt; the export of products that have both commercial and military use. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; But starting in two years, U.S. companies choosing to export the
&gt; more sophisticated software would have to set up what the industry
&gt; is calling a "key recovery" system. 

&gt; That system would enable intelligence officials and law-enforcement
&gt; agents, armed with court warrants, to go through a lengthy multistep
&gt; process that would give them the mathematical key to decoding
&gt; scrambled communications. 

&gt; The approach replaces the administration's earlier proposed "key
&gt; escrow" system in which the government would have been the
&gt; repository of the numeric keys -- leading to fears of potential
&gt; government abuse, or a reluctance by legitimate foreign users to buy
&gt; the software. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Still, the success of the system will depend in large part on the
&gt; administration's efforts to convince other countries to adopt the
&gt; same "key recovery" system, allowing their intelligence agencies and
&gt; justice systems to cooperate in trailing criminals across national
&gt; borders. 

&gt; But Clinton's aides acknowledged Monday that this process has just
&gt; begun, and so far only England and France have expressed much
&gt; enthusiasm. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Officials at IBM, which is expected to announce on Wednesday the
&gt; creation of an industry consortium to aid in establishing the "key
&gt; recovery" system, said Monday that no single entity would hold the
&gt; entire key. 

&gt; Instead, it will be divided across several companies that would
&gt; handle any given message

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; There are other potential holes in the system. Customers in the
&gt; United States will be free to buy encryption software of any
&gt; complexity -- as they can today -- with keys that are much longer
&gt; than 56 bits and are nearly impossible to break. 

&gt; That means terrorist groups or drug dealers could still buy such
&gt; software and sneak it out of the country, or even transmit it over
&gt; computer networks. 

&gt; "There is nothing we can do about bright students or Joe Terrorist
&gt; who use sophisticated encryption systems to communicate with each
&gt; other," one senior administration official said. 

&gt; "But when they brush up against legitimate groups, especially
&gt; banks," the official said, "then they are more likely to be dealing
&gt; with a system" where law enforcement could use the key recovery
&gt; system to decode the communications.
