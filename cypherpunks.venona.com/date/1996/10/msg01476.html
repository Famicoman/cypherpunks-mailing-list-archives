		SHORT-CIRCUITS IN BURMA

The military regime in Burma decided last month to ban information
technology use and possession, in order to sustain its new iron fist on
dissidents and members of the National League for Democracy.

Among other news here's a message sent through the mailing list of the US
organisation CyberPOLIS.

---fwd message---

&gt;&gt;From: George Sadowsky &lt;George.Sadowsky@nyu.edu&gt;
&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Burma Bans modems

&gt;&gt;RANGOON, BURMA, 1996 SEP 27 (NB) -- Burma has made owning, using,
&gt;&gt;importing or borrowing a modem or fax machine without government
&gt;&gt;permission a crime, punishable by up to 15 years in jail, according to a
&gt;&gt;report by United Press International.

&gt;&gt;Burma's military government has imposed what's called "The Computer
&gt;&gt;Science Development Law" which empowers the Ministry of Communications,
&gt;&gt;Posts and Telegraphs to specify what exactly can be restricted, UPI
&gt;&gt;reports.

&gt;&gt;UPI quotes the government-run newspaper New Light of Myanmar as saying
&gt;&gt;the same punishment is prescribed for anyone who sets up a link with a
&gt;&gt;computer network without the prior permission of the ministry, or who
&gt;&gt;uses computer network and information technology "for undermining state
&gt;&gt;security, law and order, national unity, national economy and national
&gt;&gt;culture, or who obtains or transmits state secrets."

&gt;&gt;UPI reports that in July a diplomat, Leo Nichols, died in prison after he
&gt;&gt;was sentenced to a lengthy term for illegal possession of fax machines.

&gt;&gt;It's clear from this action that the SLORC, i.e. the "State Law and Order
&gt;&gt;Restoration Committee" (sic!) understands full well the benefits and
&gt;&gt;importance of the Internet and other forms of electronic communication to
&gt;&gt;open societies, and is determined to deny these benefits to its citizens.
&gt;&gt;Given its recent history and the quasi-imprisonment of Daw Aung San Suu
&gt;&gt;Kyi, this new action is perfectly consistent with the government's
&gt;&gt;previous abysmal record.

&gt;&gt;Countries who would deny open Internet access to its citizens might well
&gt;&gt;pause to consider if they wish to be associated with the current
&gt;&gt;government of Myanmar in doing so.

FURTHER INFOS
According to other sources--international press reports and electronic
forums like Usenet's *soc.culture.burma*--it turns out that Ms Aung San Suu
Kyi, 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and NLD leader, saw her telephone line cut on
Friday, Sept. 28 on the evening. That was the beginning on a widespread
crackdown on dissidents and a ban of NLD meetings. University Street, where
Ms Suu Kyi lives, was blocked to avoid demonstrations. Hundred of citizens
and NLD supporters were detained, some were released by mid-October.

The Web site <A  HREF="http://freeburma.org">http://freeburma.org</A> is a well known relay for the Burmese
diaspora, especially the daily newsletter BurmaNet, which offers a rich
compilation of dissidents' communiqués and Western newspapers articles and
editorials.

Ms Suu Kyi writes a daily letter from her home in Rangoon which is
published in the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun (in japanese,
<A  HREF="http://www.mainichi.co.jp">http://www.mainichi.co.jp</A>) - a translation appears daily in
soc.culture.burma. It seems that the letter (surely copied on an audio
tape) continues to be shipped ouside the country to be published in the
Tokyo-based newspaper.

Furthermore, other reports claimed that Burma doesn't have any official
connection to the Internet. It seems to be true, but a Burmese and US
resident found that the domain name "mmnic.net" (mm for Myanmar) was
reserved by the Burmese governement in February, 1994. The operation was
made possible with the help of the Internet provider Asia Pacific NIC based
in Tokyo, Japan. A spokesman confirmed he reserved the domain on the behalf
of Burma's State, and that it was dedicated to a future Internet
connection.

		MEDICAL PRIVACY AND PGP

---fwd message---

&gt;Sender: dfickeisen@cpsr.org (Duane Fickeisen)
&gt; Subject: cr&gt; Health Info Database Misused
&gt;
&gt;An AP story from Tampa Bay appearing in the Palo Alto Daily News asserts
&gt;that a public health worker took a laptop and disks with confidential
&gt;lists of people with AIDS and HIV home and to a gay bar to check out the
&gt;HIV status of potential dates and offered to look up names of people his
&gt;friends were interested in dating. One person asserted that he had warned
&gt;friends away from potential dates, telling them that their names were "on
&gt;the list." Another claimed that people interested in dating him backed
&gt;away after the health worker talked to them. The County Health Department
&gt;has fired him, although he claims he did nothing wrong. The former health
&gt;worker also owns and lives in a funeral home. The state had permitted such
&gt;databases to be removed from offices and taken home until they changed
&gt;their internal rules two weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;Raises anew questions about privacy and confidentiality of records,
&gt;security, and misuse/abuse of information for personal and private gain.
&gt;This ought to be raised up as an example of abuse in response to the
&gt;announced plans for a national health information database.

As far as I can remember, Phil Zimmermann, speaking during the
international encryption conference in Paris on Sept. 25, mentioned this
story to explain how easy it was to have his privacy on personal medical
records beached. And that to encrypt this sensitive information may be the
ultimate solution. Zimmermann is president of PGP Inc., which develops
computer security software based on his popular program Pretty Good Privacy
(<A  HREF="http://www.pgp.com">http://www.pgp.com</A>).
