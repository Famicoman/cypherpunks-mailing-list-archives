I'm sure they'd like to have it "applied to Internet network money."....

			 
&gt;	 FRANKFURT, Oct 3 (Reuter) - Bundesbank President Hans  
&gt;Tietmeyer said on Thursday a new government policy to give only 
&gt;banks the right to issue pre-paid cards, or ``electronic purses'', 
&gt;should also be applied to Internet network money. 
&gt;	 Tietmeyer said in the text of a speech to The Economic Club  
&gt;of New York that G-10 central bank governors were addressing the 
&gt;new payment forms because they may cause difficulties for 
&gt;central banks to ensure the integrity of payments. 
&gt;	 Tietmeyer noted European Union central bankers have agreed  
&gt;that only banks should issue the pre-paid cards. The policy is 
&gt;expected to be widened to include the rights to create and 
&gt;maintain Internet-based electronic cash systems. 
&gt;	 ``In our opinion, the same should definitely also apply to  
&gt;network money,'' he said. 
&gt;	 Tietmeyer said electronic forms of money tend to crowd out  
&gt;currency and deposit money, which may increase the potential for 
&gt;credit institutions to create money. 
&gt;	 ``Electronic money may impair the supervisory functions of  
&gt;the central bank, or, in other words, its function of ensuring 
&gt;the integrity of payments,'' Tietmeyer said in a text of the 
&gt;speech released in Frankfurt under embargo. 
&gt;	 ``That would increase the risk of crises in one country  
&gt;spreading out to engulf payment systems worldwide,'' he said. 
&gt;	 Electronic purses are plastic cards with a built-in  
&gt;micro-chip which stores the electronic cash value of an account 
&gt;and can be reloaded at special machines. 
&gt;	 The proposal to restrict such projects to banks is part of a  
&gt;new German banking law which is still under preparation but 
&gt;expected to be enforced in 1997. 
&gt;	 Tietmeyer said it was difficult to create definitive  
&gt;regulations for electronic money at ``this early stage''. 
&gt;	 ``The evolution of electronic money is only in its infancy.  
&gt;But it is a characteristic feature of today's world that 
&gt;tomorrow's world will be upon us in no time,'' he said. 
&gt;	 Electronic purses, also known as smart cards, are not yet  
&gt;available in cash-dominated Germany but tests are being run on 
&gt;several projects. 
&gt;	 Internet banking is slowly gaining credence in Germany after  
&gt;some of the top banks, including Dresdner Bank AG, launched 
&gt;securities trading accounts via the Internet.
