&gt;	 WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Congress cracked down on child  
&gt;pornographers in a new law that took effect Tuesday, making it 
&gt;illegal to appear to depict children in sexual situations, 
&gt;whether in films, computer images or photographs. 
&gt;	 But the American Civil Liberties Union decried the law as  
&gt;unconstitutional and a waste of prosecutors' resources, since it 
&gt;expanded a law designed to protect any actual children used to 
&gt;produce pornography. The ACLU said it also was so broad that 
&gt;adults portraying children in films could risk prosecution. 
&gt;	 Previously, depictions of minors produced by computers  
&gt;without using children had been outside the scope of federal 
&gt;law. The new law expands the definition of child pornography to 
&gt;include any image -- photograph, video or computer-generated 
&gt;image -- that depicts or appears to depict a minor engaged in 
&gt;sexually explicit conduct. 
&gt;	 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah  
&gt;Republican, said it was designed to protect children from sexual 
&gt;exploitation and pedophiles. ``This is a tough bill aimed a 
&gt;child pornographers,'' he said. 
&gt;	 ``While federal law has failed to keep pace with technology,  
&gt;the purveyors of child pornography have been right on line with 
&gt;it. Passage of this bill will help to correct that problem,'' 
&gt;Hatch said. 
&gt;	 But ACLU legislative counsel Daniel Katz said it had major  
&gt;ramifications for artists, the film industry and journalism. He 
&gt;said it included a waiver-of-privacy rule to permit newsroom 
&gt;searches for information related to investigations of child 
&gt;pornography. 
&gt;	 ``It is much broader, and the ramifications are  
&gt;extraordinary, both for artists and for people in the cinema,'' 
&gt;Katz said.  Under this expanded definition of child pornography, 
&gt;it would be illegal to produce or show a film that included an 
&gt;adult actor or actress portraying a minor in a sexually explicit 
&gt;scene, he said. 
&gt;	 Computers can be used to alter photographs, films and videos  
&gt;to produce sexually explicit materials virtually 
&gt;indistinguishable from unretouched photographs. The new 
&gt;technology has hampered prosecutors in their ability to obtain 
&gt;convictions because it can be impossible to identify individuals 
&gt;or to prove that the materials were produced using real 
&gt;children. 
&gt;	 The new law would allow prosecution of pornographers whether  
&gt;or not the identity of the child could be determined, so long as 
&gt;the person, even if an adult, appeared to be a minor. Currently, 
&gt;pornography is protected under free speech laws except when a 
&gt;minor child is involved. 
&gt;	 Hatch said the Judiciary Committee determined that  
&gt;computer-generated pornography posed many of the same dangers to 
&gt;children as did pornography made from unretouched photographs in 
&gt;that it could be used to seduce children into sexual activity or 
&gt;to encourage a pedophile to prey on them. 
&gt;	 The new law sets mandatory prison sentences of 15 years for  
&gt;production of child pornography, five years for possession of 
&gt;the materials and life in prison for repeat offenders convicted 
&gt;of sexual abuse of a minor. 
&gt;	 The child pornography law was included in part of a broad  
&gt;spending bill President Clinton signed into law Monday. It had 
&gt;passed the Senate Monday just hours before the midnight deadline 
&gt;for the start of the new financial year. 
&gt;	 It does not address new or expanded regulation of the  
&gt;Internet. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to 
&gt;overturn a landmark ruling by a Philadelphia appeals court that 
&gt;blocked as unconstitutional a new federal law barring indecency 
&gt;on the Internet.
