&gt; You Little Cutie, You --
&gt; 
&gt; All right already!  What about choice Z?  I waited so long to respond to the 
&gt; joke (which I went around telling everyone) I got embarrassed.  The longer I 
&gt; waited, the more stuff happened so that I just couldn't catch up and tell all.  
&gt; What about that one????
&gt; 
&gt; Actually nothing is happening (oh, except for St. Pete burning last Thursday 
&gt; night) but we manage to stay frenetically busy. Teaching dance -- the kids -- 
&gt; doing my mother/wife/housewife/daughter/friend/neighbor duties.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very, very sorry to hear about your mother's illness.  My friend/neighbor 
&gt; just told me she's been diagnosed with depression and is having a difficult 
&gt; time overcoming the stigma.  There's a pile of ignorance out there.  I'm sure 
&gt; you're aware that chronic illness and injury can take down whole families.  
&gt; How's your dad holding up?  It sounds selfish, but I hope you're taking care of 
&gt; yourself.  It's particularly difficult when you live so nearby except that when 
&gt; something is wrong and you're not there it's somehow worse.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, too bad about your heavy work load. On the other hand, I'm glad you still 
&gt; have your job.  I was also particularly happy to hear that The Equine is 
&gt; feeling frisky again.
&gt; 
&gt; This business about JP is so weird.  I wish he were normal and you two could be 
&gt; friends. But it just seems like. . . like . .. ?????  I mean, what would it 
&gt; hurt 'im?  It's just BIZARRE!  And I absolutely think it's NOT you!  I mean, 
&gt; aren't we all civilized adults here?
&gt; 
&gt; You'll be glad to know that we finally got Hannah a pet:  Mexican jumping 
&gt; beans.  She's named them Rosie, Rosie and Rosie.  (You think we're REAL mean, 
&gt; huh?)  Well, they ARE low maintenance!
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you got the cc: of the message I sent Kika over the weekend.  It had a 
&gt; short update of sorts on our condition which is, "Can't complain."
&gt; 
&gt; So .. . . I DO still love you.  You are still a good friend for putting up with 
&gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; Love,
&gt; 
&gt; Ruth

Something I've been known to babble in my sleep:

   It is by caffeine alone that I set my mind in motion.
   It is by the Mountain Dew that the thoughts acquire speed,
   the lips acquire stains, the stains become a warning.
   It is by caffeine alone that I set my mind in motion.
