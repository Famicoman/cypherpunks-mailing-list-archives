&gt;         no they cannot physically torture, but they can put your 
&gt;     intelligent, educated, civilized little white ass in with some some
&gt;     real sweet boyfriends, or sadists, or racists who are just waiting
&gt;     for revenge, or just plain killers "--oops, made a classification
&gt;     error;" and the tag on your toe says: "john doe #1276549860"
&gt; 
&gt;         and nothing prevents them from talking about poor Harry who did 
&gt;     not cooperate...

     And you still claim that AP has _no_ moral basis? 

     Is there more than one person using your account? 

     This may get me in a lot of shit, but if anyone _anyone_ treats a member
of _my_ family that way, Ohhhh shit, I'd _never_ get out of jail, assuming that
I make it that far. 

     I am not old enough to have served in Vietnam, but I did serve in the 
military, and I didn't do it to protect scumsucking politicians and shithead
sadist facist police. I did it for the college money, and because at one
point in my mis-guided youth I beleived in the constitution.

     I still think it's a good idea, and I realize that the great one-horned one
is probably right about the courts interpretation of the constitution. I also
realize that they have a certain vested interest in the status quo, and that
they had to _start_ with a certain mindset/attitude to get where their 
interpretations carry the weight that they do.  

&gt; ."Note that many governments have officially given up rape and torture as
&gt; .sanctions.  (These were once universal.)  All we have to do is get them
&gt; .to give up murder, imprisonment, and robbery as sanctions and we'll have
&gt; .civilized them completely."
&gt; .
&gt;         although I will certainly agree with your tongue-in-cheek 
&gt;     comment...
&gt; 
&gt;         wish to check the cases of rape while in custody? --don't forget 
&gt;     to include sodomy by bubba, foreign objects for women, etc.  did 
&gt;     law enforcement do this?  indirectly, yes, by failing to protect the
&gt;     accused.

     I think he was refering to geovernments in general, rather than _just
the US government (although I won't deny that it has happened here) the 
SS in germany certainly used rape and torture, and I'd bet it still goes 
on in certain countries. 

&gt;         reinstate physical torture by the state --at least you'll live
&gt;     through it!  they need you in court to parade as an example before
&gt;     they hustle you off for reeducation.

     1) You might not live thru it, and if it was legal, then they _might_
be tempted to go just a little too far.

     2) I am really hoping that the above was sarcasm.
