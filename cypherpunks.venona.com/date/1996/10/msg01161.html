     No, you DON'T have to. Laws make criminals, and Laws restrict freedom. 
Any law put into place to _prevent_ crime actually does the opposite. In 
what, 1907? Congress criminalized certain drugs (canabis &amp; cocaine and some 
others) what was previously legal became a crime, and it's practicioners 
criminals. 
     If Congress criminalizes Crypto, I and others on this list will become
criminals. We will _become_ criminals to "stop" crime, and others will give
up their freedom to "stop" us from commiting "criminal" acts. 

     Your biggest fallacy (vis a vis crypto) is that criminals will _follow_
the law. They won't by defination, execpt as needed for their schemes. That
is why they are called criminals, because the commit CRIMES, not because they
follow the law. 


&gt; why you have to have registration plates on your car, a lock on your =
&gt; car, bicycle, house etc.). That is a fact of life; one I hate. So the =

     The lock is there to stop criminals. The registration _plate_ is there
to allow the government to collect Taxes, and track people. There are serial
numbers on cars used in theft _recovery_ rather than theft prevention. 

&gt; Cryptopolicy is not a binary discussion; although some posters on this =
&gt; list seem to think so.

     The middle is defined by the extremes. I'd take the most extreme possible
stance, execpt that it is where I already stand, that the government is an
_barely_ necessary evil, and needs to be made an unnecessary evil ASAP. 

&gt; You are absolutely right. However, as said above if governments (help =
&gt; to) set up a security system then they should at least attempt to make =
&gt; criminal abuse difficult. The lock on my bicycle is not really 100% =
&gt; either (as I found out quite to often); if I'd no lock at all I would =
&gt; have a lot more problems. Also, I am *not* for a mandatory system.

     If you had _no_ lock at all, and locks weren't avaiable, guess what?
Your bike would get stolen _less_ often because you wouldn't let it out of 
your sight (well, I wouldn't let _mine_, but I spent a LOT of money (for me) 
on mine, so...) 

     And no, a lock isn't 100%. Nothing man made is. Nothing natural is.

     Ask yourself this, given a foe with more resources than you, can 
you keep him _out_ of a given computer system? Not totally.
