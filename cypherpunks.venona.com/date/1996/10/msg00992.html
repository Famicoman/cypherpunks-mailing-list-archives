Dimitri&gt; Zach, I don't think you've been on this list long enough to
Dimitri&gt; realize that Timmy started flaming me for no apparent reason,
Dimitri&gt; and lying about me, and attributing to me various shit I
Dimitri&gt; never said. I'm just pointing out that he's a liar and a
Dimitri&gt; generally despicable net.scum.

Well, to one who inserts "(spit)" after nearly every name he cites, and
critiques Hayek as "fucking unreadable. Shit.," I suppose Hayek must indeed
seem unreadable. Shit.

After all, Hayek rarely writes things like: "The senile Von Mises (spit)
and his Sovok Cabal plotters...."

As to "forcing" your students to read Hayek, just who is in charge? If
you're the instructor, they can choose to read what you tell them to read,
or be unprepared on the exams you give and possibly flunk the class. What
part of "Required Reading" do you or your students not understand?

Are you jealous, Tim )fart)? You're just a senile old fart, not worth my
spittle. I make you feel better I'll put (fart) after you stupid name. Shit.

&gt; After all, Hayek rarely writes things like: "The senile Von Mises (spit)
&gt; and his Sovok Cabal plotters...."

Senile Tim May (fart) exposes himself as a liar by attributing to me shit
I've never said (Pidor Vorobiev's forgeries). Please stop polluting this
mailing list with your lies and personal attacks.

&gt; you're the instructor, they can choose to read what you tell them to read,
&gt; or be unprepared on the exams you give and possibly flunk the class. What

It's been many years since Tim May (spit) has been to college, hasn't it?
I don't blackmail my students into doing the work they don't want to do
by blackmailing them with grades. When I taught comp.sec., I said from the
start that everyone gets an A, and I trust tgen to be motivated enough to
read everything I _suggest_ they read. And they all did a great job and
earn3d their A's.

Senile Tim May (fart) is a fucking statist asshole.

Fuck you and fuck your criminal Arm*nian grandparents.

What are the last two letters of "doesn't" and "can't"?
Coincidence?  I think not.
