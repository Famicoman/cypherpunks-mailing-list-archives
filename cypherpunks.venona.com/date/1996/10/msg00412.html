        The resent the word cult being used to describe my religions.
While I don't think it is good to make fun of even one's own religion I
really think that it is in bad taste to knock another's religion. Time and
bandwidth have been wasted on more than one occasion with your
interjecting your personal views about other peoples religions only to
find that other people do not view their faiths academically. I think that
all religion should be kept off this list . I did not become a member to
prostelytise people on this list and did not expect other people to start
agitating mormons or moslems or Jews or other faiths. I mind my p's&amp;q's
but I don't have and certainly will sit idly by when someone makes my
people look bad. Any trouble that you have made starting this thread was
done by you so don't complain.
         Inciderntally, I emailed tilly a great source for soy meats for
all those that have emailed me to say that they are returning to the
church.

&gt; I suppose I'm chagrinned that a thread I named, "Utah as a Religious Police
&gt; State," has been followed by *so many* religious flames, pro- and con-
&gt; Mormonism. (I use Mormonism as shorthand for LDS...sosumi.)
&gt; 
&gt; My point was not to attack Mormonism, esp. the religious beliefs.
&gt; Personally, I think cults are useful in keeping people off the streets
&gt; (better than police-enforced curfews). I was mainly challenging Attila's
&gt; glowing opinion of how his community "enforces curfews big time." Telling
&gt; people when they can be on public streets and when they cannot is no
&gt; different than telling them what they can read and what they cannot.
&gt; 
&gt; ("Telling them" in the sense of backing it up with the power of the state.
&gt; For example, the LDS church is perfectly free to "tell" its members not to
&gt; read the books of, say, Juanita Brooks. However, this may not be enforced
&gt; by the government or its police and court arms, so long as Utah is part of
&gt; these United States. Period.)
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I find Mormonism to be a good "survival meme."
&gt; Self-preparedness, food storage, self-reliance, etc., are all counter to
&gt; the "I'll just let government take care of me" meme which is so common in
&gt; the rest of society. I don't cotton to supernatural explanations of the
&gt; world, though, so I've never been in involved in any religion (past age 11).
&gt; 
&gt; This is the last thing I'll say on Mormonism. Whether some subset of
&gt; settlers committed some set of crimes in Mountain Meadows is a footnote in
&gt; history--who really cares about such anomalies? I care more about the
&gt; present.
&gt; 
&gt; I still urge Attila to rethink his enthusiastic support of state-enforced
&gt; curfews, or state-imposed bans on alcohol (not that I recall him supporting
&gt; this particular law), etc.
