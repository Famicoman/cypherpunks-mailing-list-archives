(ABSTRACT and DRAFT)

I confirm that the timing attack was well known to designers of smart
cards for some time.
- --- Jean-Jacques Quisquater, Dec. 20, 1995, sci.crypt

I'm a bit puzzled by the excitement over error analysis attacks --
they've been known for some time to cryptosystem implementors ...
- --- Paul Kocher, Oct. 20, 1996, comp.security.misc

How to find a secret key faster than the exhaustive search without the
help of the differential analysis.
- --- This paper

During the last months very interesting programs, papers and
announcements were released about the (cryptanalytic) use of transient
faults in tamper resistant (or proof) devices by:

- - some well-known anonymous authors (in the payTV context; SFS);
- - Anderson and Kuhn (applications well fitted to the real world);
- - Boneh, Demillo and Lipton: they specifically attack public key cryptosystems;
  their core attack bells an alert to the scientific community to
  publish faster (-: sorry my keyboard do not like to use :-) in that order);
- - Biham and Shamir: they described how to obtain a secret key (e.g. for DES)
  using few ciphertexts. 

This list is open and we reserve some room in this paper for the
- - future unknown authors.

Here we describe a new use of such attacks in order to accelerate
exhaustive keysearches in several contexts. We don't discuss if these
attacks are feasible: our main goal is to enumerate all possible
attacks and their cryptanalytic use against specific models. Knowing
that will improve our trust about the current or future devices in
order to obtain a reasonable level of security in a complete system.

Introduction

We suppose that the opponent is in possession of the secure device,
able to know the (external) inputs and the outputs and to apply some
physical constraints in order to trigger some transient errors at
some random locations (RAM, registers, ...). We suppose that these
errors do not interfere with the program used by the computations:
these errors only modify some data at some stage of the computation.
We do not here discuss the possibility of permanent errors: it will
be explained in the full paper (incremental permanent errors with
possible use of several secure devices, ...).

They are many protocols where the input message and the corresponding
output message are accessible to everybody including the opponent
if the device is physically in the hand of the user (maybe for some short
period of time):

Let f be a public cryptographic function, computed by some secure device
      (smart card, secure black box, security hardware, ...),
    k a secret key, stored by the secure device,
      guessing its value is the goal of the opponent in this paper,
    n the number of bits of the key k,    
    K is the set of all keys for f,    
    N the number of possible keys in K,
    m an input message,
    c an output message.

General protocol:
    input:  m
    output: c = f(m, k)

Examples:
- - encryption of m by any secret key algorithm (DES, IDEA, ...),
- - decryption of m by any secret key algorithm (DES, IDEA, ...),
- - computation of the hashing of m by the keyed hash function f (MAC, ...),
- - m is a random number used by some identification protocol,
- - ... .

Such protocols need very often some protections against possible
abuses from (well-chosen by the opponent) messages m (see
Biham-Shamir, Matsui, Vaudenay, ...) or not so random numbers.
One necessary condition is to avoid the discovery of k by exhaustive
key search: such a general search algorithm is now described.

Key search algorithm:
    Given m, c
    Enumerate all candidate keys i from K
      Compute f(m, i) = c_i 
      If c_i = c then (output i and stop)
    End of loop.

Mean work factor: N / 2.

Indeed, if we suppose that the key is unique for each pair (m, c) (it is not
true for DES: they are sometimes collisions) then the number of
computations of f is N/2 for the mean case and N for the worst case. 
The goal of this paper is to show how to improve such a complexity by 
the use of (randomly activated) transient faults in the secure device.

Model 1: Single fault in the secret key

 - Working hypothesis:
   the opponent is able to modify at a random location one bit of the
   key k (the new transient key is then  k*) and to get the correct result of f(m, k*); 
   after the reset of the secure device by the opponent, the internal
   secret key is again the correct one k. We suppose that the random 
   modification is equidistributed on all n bits of the key k.

 - Key search algorithm: given m,

   1. Physical attack of the secure device:
      Obtain the n possible pairs (m, c_j) where c_j is equal to f(m, k_j);
      k_j is the modified key k with the jth bit being flipped;
      We need about n*log n "questions" to obtain the n different
      pairs (by the coupon collector paradox: in some way the dual of
      the birthday paradox), that is, if f is the  DES for instance, about 300
      accesses to the secure device.

   2. Enumerative key search on an external key search machine:
      Given m, the c_j's
      Enumerate (pseudo-) randomly all candidate keys i from K
        Compute f(m, i) = c_i 
        If c_i = one of c_j's then (output i^*=i and stop)
      End of loop.

   3. Key correcting algorithm on an external computer:
      Given m, i^*, c,
      Enumerate the n values i coming from i^* with one flipped bit at
      every n possible positions
        Compute f(m, i) = c_i
        if c_i = c then (output i and stop)  !the secret key is found!
      End of loop.

Mean work factor: (N / (2*n)) + n.

Indeed, the first step is very fast, the second step needs the mean
work factor of the exhaustive key search divided by the number of bits
of the key (if we suppose that the modified keys are randomly distributed 
in the key set K) and the last step needs indeed n computations of f.

For DES it means about 2^49 computations: let us recall that one
FPGA device in one proposed implementation (see van Oorschot and
Wiener) is able to do about 2^26 computations of DES, with key change,
each second (using a pipelined implementation it is possible to
compute a DES at each clock tick and we here suppose a very possible 
clock of 65 MHz). It means that one secret key will be recovered by
such a small , accessible and inexpensive machine
in 2^23 seconds, that is, less than 4 months. With p FPGAs working in
parallel that time will be divided by p. The comparison operation
in step 2 needs a modification of such a machine (a very easy step
in software): it is a simple modification and thanks to the paper [Desmedt,
Quisquater, EUROCRYPT '87] it is possible to implement it in the case of many
c_j's without any large expense and using a very simple hash (non 
cryptographic) function.

Model 2: Multiple faults in the secret key

 - Working hypothesis:
   The opponent is able to modify at random locations one or several bits of the
   key k (the new transient key is k*) and to get the correct result of f(m, k*); 
   after the reset of the secure device, the internal secret key is
   again k. We suppose that the random modifications are equidistributed on all n
   bits of the key k. The main idea is that the opponent is able with
   a high probability to change randomly few bits of the secret key.

It is easy to adapt the key search algorithm in that context.
The complexity of the attack is directly related to the number of
modified keys. The step 3 is also easy: if the key change is too
large in relation to the number of flipped bits, it is sometimes
necessary to skip the search and to begin a new one.

Model 3: Attacking several secret keys in parallel using several
secure devices

It is easy to see that the first secret key will be found by a number
of computations equal to the number needed for the two first models
divided by the number of secure devices used in parallel. It means
a very fast discovery in case of a massive attack.

In the complete paper we will explain 
- - how to filter efficiently the noise (transient errors with useless output),
- - how to combine such an attack with the one by Biham and Shamir,
- - how to resist to these attacks without expensive computations by the
  secure device, 
- - how this attack is useful to know for public key cryptosystems.

Conclusion
We describe a new use of the attack by transient fault in a secure
device: without any new protection and if this attack is feasible
it means that a secret key will be obtained by about N / log (N) computations
                                                            2
(or less!) instead of N/2 computations by the normal exhaustive keysearch.
In that case this attack is really shortening your keys.
