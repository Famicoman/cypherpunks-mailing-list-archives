&gt; 
&gt; In this message, we introduce binding cryptography, a new proposal for
&gt; establishing an information security infrastructure that does not
&gt; hamper law enforcement. We present an alternative that can give
&gt; law-enforcement agencies access to session keys, without users having
&gt; to deposit private keys. Unilateral fraud in this scheme is easily
&gt; detectible. We outline the proposal below, and announce two articles
&gt; which will describe the proposal in more detail and which will provide
&gt; the legal and the technical context.

 
&gt; Metaphorically speaking, our solution consists of equipping public-key
&gt; encryption systems used for confidentiality with a (car) governor (a
&gt; speed-limiting device). The specifications of this governor are rather
&gt; general, and so many systems can probably be equipped with them. It is
&gt; inspired by the proposal of Bellare and Rivest [BR], in which users'
&gt; encrypted messages consist of three components:
&gt; 1. the (actual) message encrypted with any symmetric system, using a random session
&gt; key; 
&gt; 2. the session key encrypted with the public key(s) of the addressee(s);
&gt; 3. the session key encrypted with the public key of a Trusted Retrieval Party (TRP).

&gt; In effect, the TRP is treated as a virtual addressee, although the
&gt; message is not sent to it. When a law-enforcement agency is conducting
&gt; a lawful intercept and strikes upon an enciphered message, they take
&gt; the third information component to the TRP. If shown an appropriate
&gt; warrant, the TRP decrypts the information component and hands over the
&gt; session key, so that the law-enforcement agency has access to the
&gt; message. Observe that users are not obliged to escrow their (master)
&gt; keys, they only give access to the (temporary) session keys used in
&gt; the communication. The concept of "virtual escrow" has been the base
&gt; of several escrow products (AT&amp;T Crypto, RSA Secure, TIS Commercial
&gt; Key Escrow).
&gt; 
&gt; The main drawback of this concept is that it offers no possibility, at
&gt; least for others than the TRP, to check whether the third component
&gt; actually contains the (right) session key; moreover, the TRP will only
&gt; discover fraud after a lawful wiretap. This renders the solution
&gt; almost entirely unenforceable.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, we propose a binding alternative, which adds a fourth
&gt; component to the encrypted message: 
&gt; 4. binding data.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is that any third party, e.g., a network or service provider,
&gt; who has access to components 2, 3 and 4 (but not to any additional
&gt; secret information) can: 
&gt; a. check whether the session keys in components 2 and 3 coincide; 
&gt; b. not determine any information on the actual session key.

What prevents me from superenciphering the body of the message?

That would render the whole "fraud prevention" useless, wouldn't it?

thanks

&gt; In this way, fraud is easily detectible: a sender that attempts to
&gt; virtually address a session key to the TRP (component 3) that is
&gt; different from the real one he uses on the message (or just nonsense)
&gt; will be discovered by anyone checking the binding data. If such
&gt; checking happens regularly, fraud can be properly discouraged and
&gt; punished. The binding concept supports the virtual addressing of
&gt; session keys to several TRPs (or none for that matter), for instance,
&gt; one to a TRP in the country of the sender and one in the country of
&gt; the addressee. The solution therefore offers the same advantage for
&gt; worldwide usability as the Royal Holloway [Holl] concept. We also
&gt; remark that the concept supports the use of controllable key splitting
&gt; in the sense of Micali [Mica] as well: a sender can split the session
&gt; key and virtually address all the shares separately to the addressee
&gt; and various TRPs using the binding concept. Moreover, the number of
&gt; shares and the TRPs can - in principle - be chosen freely by each
&gt; user. Finally we remark that the time-boundedness conditon (the
&gt; enforceability of the timelimits of a warrant) can be fulfilled by
&gt; additionally demanding that encrypted information (or all components)
&gt; be timestamped and signed by the sender; a condition that can be
&gt; publicly verified by any third party (e.g., monitor) as well.
&gt; 
&gt; A PKI that incorporates binding data hence has the following four
&gt; players: 
&gt; - Users, i.e., governments, businesses, and citizens, 
&gt; - TTPs offering trusted services (e.g., time-stamping and certification of
&gt; public keys), 
&gt; - TRPs aiding law-enforcement agencies with decrypting legally intercepted messages, 
&gt; - Monitors, monitoring communications encrypted via the PKI on compliance with 
&gt; binding regulations. For instance, these could be network operators or (Internet) service
&gt; providers.
&gt; 
&gt; In [VKT], we explain how we envision the framework in which the
&gt; binding concept could present a security tool in the information
&gt; society. We think the concept is flexible enough (e.g., in the choice
&gt; of TRPs) to be incorporated into almost any national crypto policy, on
&gt; both the domestic and foreign use of cryptography.
&gt; 
&gt; In a mathematical paper [VT], Verheul and Van Tilborg propose a
&gt; technical construction for binding data for an important public-key
&gt; encryption system: ElGamal. This construction is compatible with
&gt; Desmedt's [DESM] traceable variant of ElGamal. The construction is
&gt; based on the techniques used in zero knowledge proofs. We expect that
&gt; these constructions can be improved and that various other public-key
&gt; encryption systems can be equipped with binding data. We present this
&gt; as a challenge to the cryptographic research community.
&gt; 
&gt; An outline of the mathematical construction of binding ElGamal can be
