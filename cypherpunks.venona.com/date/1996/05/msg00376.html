&gt;but you still don't understand what I stated. the above does not make
&gt;any sense relative to the PICS system. it would be like saying, "we 
&gt;are going to report anyone who doesn't have a SMTP that bans dirty
&gt;email". SMTP does not ban dirty email by definition. PICS does not
&gt;censor material by definition. please read the PICS proposal (sorry the
&gt;URL is not handy, could someone post it?)

	See below; I had read this _before_ posting on the CyberAngels and
PICS.

&gt;PICS *doesn't*involve*the*page*designer*. this is an absolutely 
&gt;key component of its design. it exists indepedent of page creators.
&gt;if page creators are suddenly being pressured to format their 
&gt;pages in some way, then PICS has failed in some of its key design
&gt;goals. there are some *optional* ways that page designers can invoke
&gt;PICS principles as I understand, but they make no sense to me. (it
&gt;would be equivalent to someone rating their own material, something
&gt;I think is going to be far from the main use of ratings in the future)

From:	IN%"frantz@netcom.com" 16-APR-1996 20:19:13.88
&gt;From <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/iacwc.htm">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/iacwc.htm</A>

&gt;... PICS specifies three ways to distribute labels. The first is to embed
&gt;labels in HTML documents. This method will be helpful for those who wish to
&gt;label content they have created. 
&gt;
&gt;The second method is for a client to ask an http server to send labels along
&gt;with the documents it requests. The server would most likely offer the
&gt;publishers' labels, but a server could also redistribute labels from third
&gt;parties that it cooperates with. [Client sends URL of label service to browser
&gt;which responds with that service's label.  bf]
&gt;
&gt;The third way to distribute labels is through a label bureau that dispenses
&gt;only labels. A bureau could distribute labels created by one or more labeling
&gt;services. A client asks the bureau for certain services' labels of specific
&gt;resources. This is most likely to be used for third-party labels. 

	In other words, the CyberAngels want to eliminate any pages that
contain material they think minors shouldn't see that aren't self-rated with
a PICS self-rating (the first of the three types) intended to block minors
from seeing it. Yes, this is an abuse of the market oriented variety of PICS;
they obviously don't know and/or don't care. If you want to convince them
otherwise, start cc:ing your messages (and forwarding mine, on this I give you
permission) on PICS and the CyberAngels to angels@wavenet.com.
	Incidentally, their pressure (especially the legal variety - acting as
informants) could also include against an ISP that doesn't do the second for
material the CyberAngels don't like.
