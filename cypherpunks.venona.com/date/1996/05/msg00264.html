&gt;First, the U.S. banking system is very nice to account holders.  The banks,
&gt;rather than the customers, assume all risk associated with security problems
&gt;in telephone banking, ATMs, etc...  Internet banking is no different, which
&gt;explains why so few banks have jumped onto the net with real transactions.
&gt;If an SFNB customer should lose any funds due to a security problem, SFNB
&gt;pays, not the customer.

	That would depend on whether the customer can prove a security problem,
because otherwise you're going to get a lot of con artists making a lot of
money off of you.

&gt;Second, in order to break the SSL-protected password of an SFNB account
&gt;holder, you need access to the encrypted data.  This is not easy to obtain
&gt;over the Internet, and would generally require illegal activity in order 
&gt;to gain control of a host within the Internet infrastructure or collusion 
&gt;with the account holder.  Should an attacker crack the key and obtain 
&gt;the account number and password of an SFNB account holder, they are clearly 
&gt;warned upon login that they are engaging in illegal activity.  Once they 

	One, ever heard of a packet sniffer? If the account holder is on an
Intranet, then someone within it could easily get such information. Two,
somehow I suspect that the penalties for computer breakins are significantly
less than those for bank fraud/grand theft; they aren't going to matter if
you're willing to take the risk.

&gt;have logged in, there is no way to transfer money out of the account 
&gt;without leaving a target address and phone number for the recipient.  
&gt;Furthermore, any payment to an individual or unknown entity would be 
&gt;made in the form of a physical check that would have to be cashed at
&gt;a physical bank.  The whole process is heavily audited with real-time 
&gt;audit filtering and pattern matching capabilities -- SFNB is, afterall, 
&gt;running on a military grade secure operating system (see SWP at 
&gt;www.secureware.com).  Any security system that is deployed should be
&gt;compared against the value you are trying to protect.  It seems like a 
&gt;pretty big risk to an attacker -- and I assure you SFNB will prosecute.

	Target address and phone number? Make fake ID, get yourself a PO box
and a telephone forwarding/answering service (giving the PO box as the
address), then target it there. Use the fake ID at a check-cashing place. You
can make the fake ID in whatever name you want, which makes it easier.

&gt;Finally, I whole-heartedly agree that 40-bit encryption is far too weak 
&gt;for many applications, and that the current export limitations are absurd.  

	I'm glad you realize that. I've edited out what look to be
improvements, which I hope for your stockholders' sake you've implemented.
	-Allen
