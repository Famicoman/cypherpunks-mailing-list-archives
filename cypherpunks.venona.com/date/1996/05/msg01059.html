&gt; &gt; I'll just give one problem: the principal-agent problem.  How do owners of
&gt; &gt; the company make sure the managers operate the company in their best
&gt; &gt; interest?
&gt; 
&gt; Actually looting of companies happens a lot right now today, and very
&gt; seldom leads to criminal charges.  Twice I have lost a job because the
&gt; company I worked for went under, apparently due to looting.

Be careful to distingiush "owner" from "employee."  All to common a
mistake I fear.

Until someone passes a constitutional right to not be fired, well, you're
employeed at the will and by the good grace of the owners and your boss.

&gt; &gt; Solution: reputation.  If the managers don't do the right things, the
&gt; &gt; owners arrange so that the managers lose reputation and won't get hired in
&gt; &gt; the future.  Unfortunately the science of reputation is not so advanced
&gt; &gt; that we know this will actually work.
&gt; 
&gt; At present venture capitalists seem to rely on the sniff-their-arses
&gt; method.  They talk to people and try and get a feel as to whether they
&gt; are planning a robbery.  This method is obviously likely to be less
&gt; effectual as businesses move to the net.

And even this is vulnerable to "last round" problems.

&gt; In some businesses we can solve this problem by cryptographic control
&gt; mechanisms, such as open books banking.

I really wish someone would publish a paper on this.  (hint hint).

&gt; In others, such as net startups,
&gt; I see no solution other than increased reliance on personal individual
&gt; capital.

Still, vulnerable to last round problems.

&gt; Athenian capitalism worked largely on personal capital.  Because of their
&gt; terrible arithmetic system, bookkeeping was really bad, and in consequence
&gt; stock investments tended to go sour.  Socrates lost a bundle in this 
&gt; fashion, which may explain his lack of enthusiasm for capitalists.

He also made a killing on predicting crops by his knowledge of the
weather.  Go with what you know.  If you aren't a good corporate analyist,
that's what mutual fund managers are for.

&gt; &gt; Solution: smart contracts.  This is Nick Szabo's idea of building
&gt; &gt; contractual obligations into cryptographic protocols so that the parties
&gt; &gt; have no choice but to fullfil them.  But again we don't know whether this
&gt; &gt; will actually work for this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; It will work for many particular cases of this problem.

But what happens when there are nuances or circumstances which contracts
do not anticipate?  This "complete" reliablity is also a curse for
flexibility which fast moving entities need to survive.
