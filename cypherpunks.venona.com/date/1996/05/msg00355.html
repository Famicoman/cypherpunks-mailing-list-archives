	 WASHINGTON (Reuter) - A body was found Monday in the area  
where former CIA Director William Colby went missing after going 
canoeing on April 27, Maryland Department of Natural Resources 
police said. 
	 There was no immediate confirmation that the body was that  
of Colby, a spokeswoman said. ``Yes, a body was found,'' she 
said. The search had been under way in the area of Colby's 
weekend home at Cobb Neck in southern Maryland on a tributary of 
the Potomac River. 
	 Colby, who served as director of the CIA in the 1970s, was  
reported missing after his swamped canoe was found and he had 
not returned to his home. 
	 A CNN producer reported that a male body was found washed up  
on the shore of the Wicomico River about 20 yards from where the 
canoe was found. 
	 While there was no immediate identification of the body, CNN  
said ``officials have confirmed it was a male body and they say 
everything fits -- it looks like Colby.'' 
	 His disappearance had touched off an air and water search  
that included divers and specially trained dogs but the probe 
turned up no sign of a body in the cold, murky waters.
