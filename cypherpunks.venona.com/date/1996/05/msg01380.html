&gt;I've been following alt.religion.scientology mostly for entertainment

&gt;psychiatry made by Scientologists.  There's more to the story than you
&gt;appear to be aware of.  The extra-legal actions didn't originate with
&gt;the alleged copyright violations, nor are the legal actions of the cult
&gt;limited to protecting their copyrights.  Now that the cypherpunks have
&gt;been brought to their attention it's entirely possible that the major
&gt;posters on this newsgroup will become the subject of Scientology's, or
&gt;rather Religious Technology Center's legal actions.

Ironically, CoS was trying to determine my name, from Keith.

If I'm subpoenaed, I think I'll tell them to fuck off. I'm not a party to
the CoS business in any way, save for whatever influence I may have had
when the first remailers were implemented several years ago   (by others,
not me) and whatever ideas I may have discussed here on this list.

&gt;Yes, the cult does have a legitimate interest in protecting their
&gt;copyrights.  No, the cult does not have a valid reason for using the
&gt;heavy-handed legal tactics of which they are so fond.

I'm not a defender of CoS, let's make this clear. I knew they were flakes
since I first heard of them back around 1967, before most of you were even
born.

But there is an ongoing, vitriolic battle between the CoS and its critics,
and the remailers are one of the main "weapons" being used.

I take no sides whatsoever, merely noting that it is, in Bill Stewart's
words, "unsurprising" that CoS lawyers are taking the steps they are
taking.
