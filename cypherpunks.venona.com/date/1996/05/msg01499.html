&gt;Subject: PROTOCOL: Encrypted open books
&gt;Status: OR
&gt;
&gt;Note: I started this reply last week; I've decided to post what I
&gt;know, since I don't have a solution and I've run out of simple ideas
&gt;for now.
&gt;
&gt;Hal' criticism that (real) money could leak out of the system is
&gt;correct.  The problem is that while the books would still balance,
&gt;i.e. sum to zero, some fake depositor would have a negative balance,
&gt;the net result of taking out more money than you put in.  Negative
&gt;numbers just aren't allowed in double-entry bookkeeping, but they were
&gt;allowed in the first protocol set.
&gt;
&gt;The first part of the solution is to allow no private accounts on the
&gt;left hand (asset) side of the ledger, in other words, no anonymous
&gt;loans.  A protocol for doing anonymous loans could be invented, but
&gt;since the first problem is merely to run a money exchange and not more
&gt;complicated financial services, this is acceptable.  Most of the money
&gt;that left the S&amp;L's was by corrupt loan practices, so I don't consider
&gt;this omission a particularly glaring one right now.
&gt;
&gt;Therefore all the private accounts must be on the right hand side,
&gt;that is, they are all liabilities.  In layman's terms, the bank owes
&gt;you; should you ask for your money, they have to give it to you.  If
&gt;we can verify that each of these accounts never goes negative, then we
&gt;can be certain that if the books balance, that the amounts of money in
&gt;each account are accurate.
&gt;
&gt;Consider this.  If money was transferred from your account to another
&gt;one, that transaction shows up in the public encrypted transaction
&gt;record.  If you have due diligence over this record, you can assertain
&gt;that no transaction was performed against your will.  This case
&gt;corresponds to a debit and credit against two customer accounts,
&gt;decreasing one and increasing the other.
&gt;
&gt;Another way that money might end up in a fake account if it were
&gt;credited with assets.  A debit to an asset increase its value and the
&gt;credit to the account increases that value.  This is the case of a
&gt;deposit; the bank gets cash (+asset) and credits someone's account
&gt;(+account).  Now if they want to give someone money this way, they
&gt;have to do so by increasing the assets somehow; in other words, they
&gt;money has to come from somewhere.  It didn't come from any of the
&gt;customers because they've already verified that.  It didn't magically
&gt;appear from one of the other asset accounts because these are all
&gt;publically audited.
&gt;
&gt;In summary, we need to ensure that all accounts have positive balance.
&gt;Public accounts can be revealed and seen to be positive.  Private
&gt;accounts need a cryptographic assurance.
&gt;
&gt;A private account starts off at zero.  This can be publically
&gt;revealed.  Then to the encrypted transaction log and the public cyclic
&gt;balances we add publication of the private balances in encrypted form
&gt;that allows us to verify to the blinded balance is positive.  This
&gt;balance is verifiably linked to previous cyclic balances via the
&gt;transaction log.  It is therefore linked all the way back to the
&gt;beginning balance which was zero.
&gt;
&gt;Consider all the transaction triples for which the first element is
&gt;equal to the private account in question, since the account was
&gt;opened.  Take a product of all of the second elements and a product of
&gt;all the third elements.  It is clear that these products can be
&gt;calculated inductively from the previous cyclic products and the
&gt;activity in this cycle.
&gt;
&gt;The products on second and third elements are equal to
&gt;
&gt;        g^( Sum x_i,j,t + Sum r_i,j,t ), h^( Sum r_i,j,t )
&gt;
&gt;where I've added a time index by cycle which was implicit before.  The
&gt;notation for the inductive calculation is different, of course, and
&gt;also obscures the underlying invariant.
&gt;
&gt;What we want is a certificate that Sum x_i,j,t is positive.  Here it
&gt;gets a bit hairy.  There are likely other solutions to this technical
&gt;requirement; here is the one I thought up yesterday and today.
&gt;
&gt;I thought I had an idea with promise on how to create such
&gt;certificates using quadratic residuosity, but it doesn't work.  I'm
&gt;still thinking about it; this certificate doesn't seem impossible to
&gt;create, but the standard ideas that I know about in algebraic protocol
&gt;design don't seem to work.
&gt;
&gt;If anybody wants to work on this technical point off-line with me,
&gt;send me mail.  The math involved is advanced enough that I'd prefer to
&gt;post summaries of work rather than all the detailed discussion.
&gt;
&gt;Another non-technical attack on the problem is to require periodic
&gt;bank holidays, where all private balances will be revealed to be zero
&gt;(preferably), or whatever is actually in the account.  This doesn't
&gt;prevent owner fraud, but does put an upper bound on the time in which
&gt;to perpetrate it.
&gt;
&gt;Eric
