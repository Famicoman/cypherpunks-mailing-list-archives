&gt; the assassination politics is quite Hitleresque at its root.

	It is more the MAD theory brought down to the personal level. The
government has the power and authority to kill anyone of us, AP brings out
into the open the fact that WE ALL HAVE THAT POWER. KIlling people is
(physically) very easy, AP turns the THREAT back on those who hold the
power. Note: I don't necessarily think that AP is a good idea. I think
that people should do their own dirty work.

&gt; such is the total moral perversion of the thinking behind 
&gt; "assassination politics". most of the adherents work from the 
&gt; following argument, nicely summarized by JFA above:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. the government is corrupt
&gt; 
&gt; 2. therefore, it is okay to kill people who further that corruption.
&gt; 
&gt; wow, what brilliant logic. I must admit it proves to be superior to
&gt; that embodied by any second grader, a high accomplishment for its
&gt; proponents.

	How about this:

	Goverments, and the people in them are corrupt. This corruption,
caused by acts of these people, lead to oppression and death. By THEIR
MORALITY oppression and killing are ok, so it is ok to use their tools
agaisnt them.

&gt; there is a trite saying, "two wrongs do not make a right" (trite
&gt; because most have mastered the simple truth of it in their pre-teen
&gt; years). a concept not grasped by some second-graders. some 
&gt; require a lifetime of lessons to comprehend it in the end..

	Putting people in cages is wrong.
	Stealing is wrong.
	Is putting people in cages for stealing wrong?

&gt; carefully the errors of those who have come before you. write
&gt; a long treatise with lots of footnotes to past assassination
&gt; difficulties and how you would advance past them. I tell
&gt; you flat out that any respectable assassin would be quite embarrassed
&gt; to be associated with you at the moment because of your arrogance
&gt; and ignorance.

	I might be wrong here, but I don't think that Mr. Bell actually
wants anyone actually shot, well, maybe he does, but what he wants is to
have the same power over members of governments than they have over him.
