&gt;From: TCMay

&gt;&gt;If a system gets built into the WWW, as with proposals for PICS, it _will_
&gt;&gt;be used by those who want to control content. We should think twice before
&gt;&gt;helping in any way.

&gt;I agree with your hesitation totally. I can easily see how the system
&gt;would be twisted in unspeakable ways. but I can see a lot of very
&gt;powerful positive uses too. as long as the best attempts are made to
&gt;discourage the former and encourage the latter...  again, there is a
&gt;question that the future might turn out to be more orwellian if no
&gt;action is taken by internet designers whatsoever. I tend to believe
&gt;that view.

	It currently appears that both groups doing PICS ratings are doing it
in a way that very much promotes unethical usage (by those wishing to control
content). This does not bode well for future uses of it.

&gt;&gt;(No, I'm not _against_ private ratings services...but this has little to do
&gt;&gt;with _me_, and I won't participate. More importantly, I won't have my
&gt;&gt;content have any kind of tag attached!

&gt;notice that what you demand is wholly irrelevant. if you put something
&gt;out in the public, in a world of free speech, anyone is free to
&gt;rate your posting, or your opinions, etc.-- they just set a system
&gt;that refers to the message-id of your posts or something.

&gt;if what you are instead saying is that you will never insert your
&gt;own tags into your content, well that is something you have control
&gt;over. but you have absolutely no control over what people "attach"
&gt;to your posts in a "virtual" sense.  anyone could set up the
&gt;TCMay Rating Service and register ratings on everything you post in
&gt;public.

	However, one can do things to disrupt the rating system. Until we've
got true AI, a web spider will be able to find and classify a newly-re-URLed
page a lot faster than the rating people are able to find it - especially if
one goes ahead and submits the web page to all the search engines every time
you reclassify it. A search engine could turn over all new pages to be rated -
but that would slow them down a lot, and other search engines would be used
more because they'd be more up to date.
	If you have some ratings services that you like - market-determined
ones, for instance - you can let them know the new URL also.

	The above is a bit harder for ratings of USENET posts and mailing list
messages, but there are so many of those that they'll be hard for a rating
service to keep up with.
