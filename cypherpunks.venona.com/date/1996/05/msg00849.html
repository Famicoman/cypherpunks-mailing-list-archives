First Monday is a peer-reviewed journal on the Internet - about the
Internet. This
scientific journal expands the frontiers of academic publishing by
combining the
tradi-tional values of peer-reviewing and strict quality control with a new
way of
publishing on the World Wide Web.


Aim and Scope

The aim of First Monday is to publish original articles about the Internet
and the Global
Information Infrastructure. First Monday will:

-       follow the political and regulatory regimes affecting the Internet
-       examine the use of the Internet on a global scale, by analyzing
economic, technical,
        and social factors
-       analyze research and development of Internet software and hardware
-       study the use of the Internet in specific communities
-       report on standards
-       discuss the content of the Internet

First Monday will appear in three formats

1. Monthly Mail from a Mail Server
First Monday will appear first of all as an electronic mail posting from
the First Monday
listserver. This issue of First Monday will be sent to the subscribers on
the first monday
of every month as an ASCII text file. It will include all the articles of
each issue and
pointers to information resources located at various Web, Gopher, and other
sites.

2. Web Site
This is the place where subscribers - and newcomers - can read about the
journal, learn
how to subscribe, read previously published articles, and submit
manu-scripts and other
materials for publication. This Web Site will also provide access to
objects and files that
are part of the articles. These objects and files can be downloaded. All
back issues of
First Monday will also be available for downloading.

3. Annual CD-ROM
First Monday will also appear as an annual CD-ROM, containing all articles
published in
a given year. This CD-ROM will be offered at a low price to subscribers at
the end of the
year.

Will paper versions be available?
First Monday is an experiment in electronic publishing, exploring the
possibilities of
communicating in this Internet medium. At the insistence of subscribers, we
can offer
printing, but only on-demand.

Process

The flow of a typical article, from author to publication:

-       An author is contacted by an Editor to write an _article, or
-       An author submits an article to a Editor by electronic mail. The
article is
        forwarded by electronic mail to the Editorial Office in Chicago.
-       The Editorial Office starts the peer-review process by forwarding
the article to
        reviewers by electronic mail. The Editorial Office is responsible
for tracking the
        article, handling comments from editors and _reviewers to authors,
editing, and
        creating a final accepted article.
-       This initial peer-reviewing process is private.
-       Articles that are accepted for publication are distributed to all
subscribers in the
        monthly mail, and posted on the First Monday Web Site. The Web Site
version
        of the article is likely to contain objects (illustrations,
programs, and other digital
        items) that are not included in the monthly mailing of the plain
ASCII text.
-       All articles published in First Monday will be included in an
annual archival
        CD-ROM. This CD-ROM will be offered to subscribers at a low price.

How to submit articles

To submit an article to First Monday, simply send it _by electronic mail to
the Editorial
Office (Edward J. Valauskas), valauskas@firstmonday.dk.

Preference will be given to articles which take advantage of the Internet,
using graphics,
programs, HTML features and components, and other features not pos-sible in
print.

The text of the article (exclusive of any other objects like pictures,
tables et cetera) should
not exceed 30.000 characters.

Format

The manuscript must be in its final form, as a plain ASCII text, suited for
distribution in
the monthly e-mail. If an Internet resource is cited, just type in the URL.
_Manuscripts
can be marked up in HTML, as long as the tags are recognizable by most
popular Web
browsers.

Non-text objects, like pictures, programs, spreadsheets, audio files, and
full motion video
files, can be part of an article. These non-text objects must be forwarded
as binary files to
the Editorial Office. Non-text should conform to well established de facto
standards on the
net: PDF, GIF, JPEG et cetera.

Priority will be given to particular items of a high scientific standard,
and articles with a
relevant timeframe can be published at short notice as a rapid publication.

Only original papers written in English will be considered for publication.

Copyright

Authors submitting a paper to First Monday automatically agree to assign
copyright to
Munksgaard International Publishers if and when the manuscript is accepted for
publication.

The articles published in First Monday are protected by copyright, which covers
translation rights and the right to reproduce and distribute all of the
articles in the journal.

Authors submitting a paper to First Monday do so in the understanding that
online
publishing on the Internet is a new opportunity and challenge, but also a
step into a new
territory, where authors and publishers do not always have the means to
protect against
unauthorized copying or editing of copyright protected works.
