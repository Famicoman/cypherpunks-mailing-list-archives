&gt; Not wanting to join in this bashing of taxes--my views are clear, as
&gt; evidenced in the title of this thread--but I have to point out that I paid
&gt; approximately 60% of everything I made last year to the tax collectors!
&gt; This counts the Federal income tax (about 32%), the California income tax
&gt; (about 11%), the "self-employment tax" (FICA) for some consulting I did
&gt; (15%), property tax on my old residence ($2200), property tax on my new
&gt; residence ($4200), sales tax on purchases (8.25%), gasoline taxes (about
&gt; 30-40 cents per gallon), a special tax on my Ford Explorer ($300), and
&gt; probably some miscellaneous other taxes I have neglected.
&gt; 
&gt; And of course the corporations that pay me dividends and whose stock price
&gt; shows gains have _already_ paid roughly 45% or so in taxes, depending on
&gt; how clever they were at allocating costs to minimize taxes. This is the
&gt; famous "double taxation" of corporate earnings one hears about. Intel, for
&gt; example, pays 45% of its considerable income in taxes, sends some of the
&gt; remaining profits to me in the form of capital gains and dividends, and I
&gt; then pay another 40% or so in income taxes on this share. The math is
&gt; pretty simple...there ain't much left over. (The much-derided Laffer Curve
&gt; is actually quite important here...when overall tax rates get high enough,
&gt; people choose to do less work. Some of us even retire early.)

Although your viewpoint is well expressed, I feel you've
overlooked the possibility of socialism to solve the high
tax outrages detailed.

Socialism, a truly progressive economic system, would have
an actual graduated income tax, to discourage useless
make-work by the rich.

There are so many other benefits to patriotic socialism, it
would take a book the size of Das Kapitol just to list them.

For instance:

Taxes on trade, will act as a tonic on the national economy.

The tax on trade, of course, prevents it; relieving the
national security apparatus of 90% of its reason for being.

The state itself as a unifying theme, rather than patho
meanderings like crime, anti-racism, and religion.

Tcmay, you've already acted on your socialistic urges without
even knowing it; your successfully operating a free people's
spontaneous propaganda bureau.  Please develop this further
and thumb your nose at the members of your class.
