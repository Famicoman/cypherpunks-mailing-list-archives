&gt; &gt; 3 problems which immediately come to mind:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; .  What if someone, hired on one occasion but fired at another,
&gt; &gt; decides in anger to "turn coat" and report everyone to the IRS (or
&gt; &gt; other fine government agency)?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; .  What if a company does not pay as expected - other than adopting
&gt; &gt; Assassination Politics, what method could an employee use towards
&gt; &gt; getting their expected remuneration for work done?
&gt; 
&gt; The nature of anonimity, IMO, precludes any legal mechanism since the 
&gt; anonymity structure was established precisely to avoid any legal 
&gt; consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; Here, I might be tempted to differeciate between two cases:
&gt; 1) the entity who wants to get out of the reach of the governmental 
&gt; system
&gt; 2) the entity who wants to get out of the reach of everybody (to con 
&gt; others)
&gt; 
&gt; The only problem is, how will you differentiate between 1) and 2) 
&gt; *before* a conflict arises?
&gt; 
&gt;   The involved party would then have to resort to use 
&gt; some sort of unofficial tribunal.  It would create a set of parrallel 
&gt; law system, and as much of them as there would be groups doing 
&gt; business together.

I disagree.  The key is prior or on site clearing.  Anonymous businesses
will have to depend more on reputation, and even reputation has its limits
when it comes to parties that obviously have no accountabilty at all.

Participants in such a market will have to be wary of the "last shot" or
"last round" problem.  (Specifically that one party to the transaction may
no longer wish to participate in the market, and not need to and thus is
free to screw the market, "cash in" his reputation and retire on the
proceeds as a result.

Still, escrows or multiple escrows will be the answer here.

 
&gt; Again, depending on the context, AP might wery well be the only 
&gt; solution or be no workable solution at all.

Now, tell me how AP is a solution if everyone in the corporation is double
blinded?  Who do anonymous parties put out betting pools on?

[As AP has been discredited in this application, your argument for it is
deleted.]

&gt; &gt; .  Wouldn't everyone need to have two jobs (or source of regularly
&gt; &gt; accepted cash), in order to be able to pay for services where
&gt; &gt; suppliers do not accept virtual cash transactions? (TCM has
&gt; &gt; mentioned before about the need to pay for some things in tiny
&gt; &gt; quantities - like quarters for a phone call, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; Any physical currency can be made traceable (put a chemical or
&gt; radioactive tracer or a zillion other tricks...)

And so?  Because I possess or have received cash from someone does not
mean that it is mine, nor that I earned it, nor that I am not merely
holding it, nor that I am not acting as trustee.

Income tax and currency taxes depend on realization events.  Even in the
strictest sense, realization is a thin and vague concept.

Your only remaining option is to tax possession of currency.  Good luck.
