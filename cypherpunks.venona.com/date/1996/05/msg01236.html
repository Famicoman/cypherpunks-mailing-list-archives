&gt;Scientology was illegal in Australia last time I heard.  They declared
&gt;that you could not be a religion and charge a fee for religious service
&gt;the way that Scientology charges.  They then defined them as practicing
&gt;medicine, and hit them with snake oil laws.

And Germany, or course, as Tim mentioned.  CoS suckered the US State Dept.
into putting pressure on the Germans, and the Scientologists on a.r.s. have
made plenty of Nazi allusions when discussing the German "bigotry."

I know that there was a big crackdown in England while Hubbard was still
alive, though the anti-Scientology laws there were rescinded some time ago,
I believe.  At one point foreign Scientologists weren't allowed into the
country.  There may still be a lot of anti-CoS sentiment there.

Ironically, if someone had asked me this questions a few weeks ago, I
probably would have answered, "The Netherlands."

p.s.  I'm a bit more caught up on my facts now.  The NOTS materials (newer
than the OT materials in the Fishman affidavit) were posted to a.r.s.
through hacktic recently.  I'm assuming that was the cause of the CoS
pressure to shut them down.  The NOTS materials were not in the public
record (like parts of the old OT materials were, as they were evidence in
the Fishman case), so the court's ruling in the case against Karin Spaink
and her ISP, XS4ALL, wouldn't seem to apply towards their being posted.
