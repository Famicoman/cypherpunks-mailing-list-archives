&gt;Subject: PROTOCOL: Encrypted Open Books
&gt;Status: OR
&gt;
&gt;Kent Hastings wondered how an offshore bank could provide assurances
&gt;to depositors.  I wondered the same thing a few months ago, and
&gt;started working on what Perry calls the anonymous auditing problem.  I
&gt;have what I consider to be the core of a solution.
&gt;
&gt;All the following protocols and ideas are in the public domain.
&gt;
&gt;The following is long.
&gt;
&gt;My notation here will also be much less formal than I am capable of; I
&gt;don't want to make the uninitiated read TeX.
&gt;
&gt;The basic idea is that summation can be performed encrypted by using
&gt;exponentiation in a finite field.  That is, if I represent an amount x
&gt;by g^x and an amount y by g^y, then I can compute the sum of x and y
&gt;by multiplying g^x and g^y, getting g^(x+y).  Very basic.
&gt;
&gt;So let us take a very simple version of this protocol, which leaves
&gt;out many desiderata.  If a shared funds account, say, has a bunch of
&gt;transactions made on it, then we can publish each of those amounts x_i
&gt;(for the non-TeX'd, underscore means subscript) encrypted as g^(x_i).
&gt;I know what my transaction number, i, is, and what the amount was, so
&gt;I can verify that my transaction appeared in the public list.  We also
&gt;publish the beginning and ending balances, givings use a total
&gt;difference X.  Now anyone can verify that g^X equals g^(Sum_i x_i).
&gt;That is, everyone can verify that the aggregate effect of the
&gt;transactions is what is claimed without revealing the amounts of any
&gt;of them.
&gt;
&gt;What does this protocol reveal?  It reveals the number of transactions
&gt;on each account and thus the total number of transactions.  It is also
&gt;subject to known plaintext attack.  If I get an account on this system
&gt;and make one transaction in each amount, I can decrypt by table lookup
&gt;the whole transaction flow.  The total number of transaction accounts
&gt;is also revealed, or, for a bank, the number of customers.
&gt;
&gt;We can easily solve the known plaintext attack by blinding each
&gt;transaction.  Instead of publishing pairs &lt;i, g^(x_i)&gt;, we have for
&gt;each transaction a blinding factor r_i and publish triples
&gt;
&gt;        &lt;i, g^(x_i + r_i), h^(r_i)&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The notation has grown.  g is a generator of a finite field G, and h
&gt;is a generator of a different finite field H.
&gt;
&gt;We also publish R = Sum_i r_i in addition to X = Sum_i x_i.
&gt;
&gt;What is the public verification procedure?  Basically the same as the
&gt;first case, but in addition taking into account the blinding factors.
&gt;
&gt;Step 1.  Calculate Product_i h^(r_i) and make sure that it equals h^R.
&gt;This validates the blinding factors.
&gt;
&gt;Step 2.  Calculate Product_i g^(x_i + r_i) and make sure that it
&gt;equals g^(X+R).  This, given the validity of the blinding factors,
&gt;validates the actual transactions.
&gt;
&gt;How does this resist known plaintext attack?  Since the blinding
&gt;factors r_i are flatly distributed over their range (caveat! you pick
&gt;the order of G smaller than of H to assure this), the x_i + r_i sum
&gt;acts exactly as a one-time pad to encrypt the amount.  In summary,
&gt;what is going on here is that both the messages (amounts) and the keys
&gt;(the blinding factors) are being sent out as images of one-way
&gt;functions (exponentiations) that preserve exactly the relationships
&gt;that we want.
&gt;
&gt;There's more.  For a real business, we want to keep double entry books
&gt;and not just single entry accounts as above.  By extending the number
&gt;of terms in the transaction, we can do that too.  In double entry
&gt;bookkeeping, the total amounts for each transaction must sum to zero
&gt;over the various accounts being transacted upon; I say this knowing
&gt;that when you print out the information for an accountant you'll have
&gt;to do some sign twiddling for the asset and liability/equity halves of
&gt;the books.  Also, a single transaction may involve more than two
&gt;accounts, even if in practice most involve only two.
&gt;
&gt;The basic idea here is that each transaction is a set of the above
&gt;transactions whose sum must be zero.  So for a transaction i, we publish
&gt;a set of triples, indexed by j,
&gt;
&gt;        &lt; T_i,j, g^( m_i,j + r_i,j ), h^( r_i,j ) &gt;
&gt;
&gt;where the subscripts are doubly indexed and where T_i,j represents the
&gt;account that amount m_i,j is changing.  Now we can perform, on each
&gt;transaction, the following very similar verification procedure for
&gt;each fixed i.
&gt;
&gt;Step 1.  Verify that Product_j h^( r_i,j ) = 1.  This verifies that
&gt;the blinding factors sum to zero.
&gt;
&gt;Step 2.  Verify that Product_j g^( m_i,j + r_i,j ) = 1.  Since the
&gt;blinding factors sum to zero, this ensures that the transaction
&gt;amounts sum to zero.
&gt;
&gt;Not that both of these sums are done over j, not i.  In other words,
&gt;we validate each transaction individually.
&gt;
&gt;Now we also publish aggregate changes in the public accounts just as
&gt;before.  The holders of private accounts know what how their accounts
&gt;have changed.  Then we can use the the single account verification
&gt;method as above to verify that the totals match.  Everyone can verify
&gt;that the public accounts match, and the holders of private accounts
&gt;can verify that they match.
&gt;
&gt;To summarize: The transactions are doubly indexed.  If you group by
&gt;transaction, then you verify that each transaction sums to zero.  If
&gt;you group by account, then you verify that the change in that account
&gt;is as expected, be it public or private.
&gt;
&gt;In the scenario that Kent originally proposed, one of the public
&gt;accounts would be a gold account, which through independent public
&gt;auditing would be verified to be accurate.  I personally would not use
&gt;gold but rather denominate certain accounts in shares of mutual funds,
&gt;which are resistant to the currency inflations of mining and stockpile
&gt;sales.
&gt;
&gt;What information is still being disclosed?  The most worrisome to me
&gt;is that the total number of transactions per account is revealed, that
&gt;is, aggregate activity, but not total money flux.  I have an insight
&gt;that may allow the _account_ to be blinded as well as the amounts, and
&gt;be revealed in aggregate just as the amounts are, but I have not
&gt;worked out the details because I am not fully up to speed on the
&gt;relevant math.
&gt;
&gt;BEGIN BIG MATH
&gt;I only expect a few people to follow the next paragraphs, so if you
&gt;don't understand it, skip it.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the idea.  The modular exponentiation is performed in a finite
&gt;ring.  We choose a ring that has lots of distinct prime ideals of
&gt;sufficiently large order.  To each account we assign one ideal.  We
&gt;represent dollar amounts as elements of this ideal; since the ideal is
&gt;prime, this is straightforward.  The property of the ideal we use is
&gt;that the sum of any two elements of the ideal is also in the ideal.
&gt;Hence by partitioning the ring, we also partition the computation of
&gt;the accounts.  We are blinding the transcations by account because we
&gt;rely on the fact that blinding is not an intra-ideal operation, and
&gt;thus does not preserve that invariant, which would otherwise be
&gt;public.
&gt;
&gt;We must be careful not to allow operations that would result in an
&gt;element which was in the intersection of two ideals.  This requires
&gt;upper bounds both on the transaction amount and on the number of
&gt;transactions per cycle.  There might be rings of order p^n+1 which
&gt;would be suitable for this operations, but I am not sure of the
&gt;security of the discrete log in such cases, except for p=2, in which
&gt;case it is bad.
&gt;
&gt;END OF BIG MATH
&gt;
&gt;The protocol as specified, though, is useful as it stands.  I have not
&gt;specified all the details.  For example the blinding factors should
&gt;likely be created in a cooperative protocol at the point of
&gt;transaction; blinding factors for intra-bank transactions should not
&gt;contain subliminal channels.  Certificates of deposit and withdrawal
&gt;should be tied to the published transaction information.  Etc.
&gt;Remember, this is the core of an idea.
&gt;
&gt;One criticism I do wish to address now.  I don't think it matters if
&gt;the bank manufactures fake transactions.  The customer can reveal the
&gt;sum of all the blinding factors for transactions on that account, in
&gt;public, and can thus prove what should have been there.  Since the
&gt;blinding factors were committed to in public, there is a strong
&gt;assurance that these blinding factors are what they are claimed to be.
&gt;This in itself can be made into an actual proof of liability.  Note
&gt;that even this revelantion does not compromise individual
&gt;transactions.  It only reveals the aggregate value change, which is
&gt;exactly what is at issue with the bank.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, all of the bank assets that are held external to
&gt;that organization can be externally audited in the same way.  The
&gt;other institutions that hold money might be persuaded to undertake a
&gt;legal obligation to honor what the encrypted open books say they
&gt;should have; this may not be difficult because they can verify that
&gt;their record of the transactions matches what has been published.
&gt;
&gt;If we use the contents of the encrypted books at the organizational
&gt;boundary points to create suitable legal opbligations, we can mostly
&gt;ignore what goes on inside of the mess of random numbers.  That is,
&gt;even if double books were being kept, the legal obligations created
&gt;should suffice to ensure that everything can be unwound if needed.
&gt;This doesn't prevent networks of corrupt businesses from going down
&gt;all at once, but it does allow networks of honest businesses to
&gt;operate with more assurance of honesty.
&gt;
