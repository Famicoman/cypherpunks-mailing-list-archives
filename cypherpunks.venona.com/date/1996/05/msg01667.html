Who would control them? Their owners, presumably.

What would they have on you? Depends on what you've done and what they can
learn.

&gt;I know you disagree, but I'm a big fan of statutes of limitations and the

If you don't want to know about it, fine. Set your filters to ignore such
things.

But suppose *I* want to know?

(And there are "legitimate" reasons. Isn't it quite plausible for a woman
to be interested in whether her prospective husband is a wife-beater? Even
if the last incident occurred (or was publically reported, at least) more
than the 7-year (or whatever) period ago?)

In any case, there are public records, such as arrest records, court
transcripts, newspaper articles, and so on. To forbid me from using these
(to throw me in jail, ultimately, for this crime) is inconsistent with a
free society.

And technology is already finding ways to route around such laws. The stuff
we are involved with will shatter such laws completely.
