Has anyone else seen the extraordinarily tasteless press release sent out
by Roadshow New media about this?

Let me show you:

                               MEDIA RELEASE

30/4/96

                           Where is William Colby?

Rescuers are searching for the former head of the CIA, William Colby, after
his mysterious disappearance yesterday. The canoe he had been using was
found capsized and abandoned, near his Maryland home.

Ironically, Colby's disappearance co-incides with the current release of
Spycraft, the CD-ROM game developed with former KGB Major general Oleg
Kalugin.

...

Is this a publicity stunt from the game's US manufacturer [Activision]?
Were some of the secrets given away in the game just a little too close for
comfort for the current heads of the CIA? Are the Russians involved? Is it
just totally coincidental?

Does the Spycraft game itself hold any answers? No doubt police will be
looking to the game for clues and have not yet ruled out foul play.

Colby and Kalugin both portray themselves within the game and it could
prove that Colby solves his own mystery.

Spycraft the game is a true-to-life espionage thriller that allows players
to experience the danger and excitement of being a real spy caught in a
deadly web of international intrigue. Every game element is taken from
real-life experience of spymasters Colby and Kalugin. the high level
involvement of these espionage experts required that the script be reviewed
by the CIA for security clearance.

This real life twist to the CD ROM game offers more intrigue for gamers.
the Internet facility may provide a solution as players across the world
ponder Colby's disappearance.

[This is followed by contact details for Roadshow, which, for you
non-Australians, is a big games distributor out here]
