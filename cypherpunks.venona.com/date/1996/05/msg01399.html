Might Rot13 be enough? It would prevent accidental viewing.

&gt;After pondering a bit it seems to me that the "knock knock" remailer
&gt;approach (only send anon-mail if the recipient agrees to receive it) could
&gt;be made feasable pretty easily.
&gt;
&gt;Rather than hold the mail while waiting for a consent to release, you
&gt;could simply encrypt the peice of mail with a symetric algorythm on its
&gt;final hop, and send the encrypted mail to the recipient.
&gt;
&gt;At this point there are 2 options, which I havnt examined closely: The
&gt;first is that you require them to send a request for their "consent-code"
&gt;which can be used to decrypt the mail. Under this arrangment you could
&gt;possibly provide for a user to specify a specific consent code, so that 2
&gt;party's who had previously agreed to communicate could avoid "knocking".
&gt;If you strip the subject, then it would be all but impossible for a person
&gt;to include the consent code in the actual peice of mail.
&gt;
&gt;The second is to simply include the
&gt;consent-code along with the encrypted peice of mail and a legal notice
&gt;stating that decryption of the mail constitutes your consent to receive
&gt;the mail, as well as your agreement to hold the remailer-operator harmless
&gt;should the mail be found to be in some way offensive. Further, the
&gt;recipient would agree to be solely liable for the contents of the mail,
&gt;etc etc.. I leave the actual agreement to the net.lawyers to figure out.
&gt;
&gt;As far as I can tell an agreement of this form would be at least as valid
&gt;as the software licenses ("NOTICE: Opening this envelope constitutes your
&gt;agreement to the terms.. blah blah blah") that are commonly used today.
&gt;Also would seem to be a similar concept to "Opening the case of this
&gt;device void's your warranty" stickers on appliances.
&gt;
&gt;Under this approach persons would receive mail whether they'd consented or
&gt;not (unless they requested to be blocked). But it would be difficult for
&gt;anyone to raise any serious legal issues about something they havnt read,
&gt;and impossible for them to make noise about what they read, after the
&gt;implied consent they gave when decrypting.
&gt;
&gt;Under both approaches it would be wise to have a list of addresses who've
&gt;already consented, which would contain all of the known remailers..
&gt;whether or not an operator chose to have names besides remailers in the
&gt;list would be at his/her discretion.
&gt;
&gt;Ben..
