&gt; Real world anonymity is difficult to buy, and actions such as murder

But that is the principle by which AP operates.  That *is* the whole 
point that seems to miss you: encryption technologies makes that 
perfectly feasible.  I agree that it is a novelty in the history of 
humankind...

&gt; I'd expect a realization of AP to promote a great backlash from a
&gt; variety of quarters.  Such methods, besides being unethical, are
&gt; probably going to be used as fodder to infringe the liberties of
&gt; others.

During the transition period, definitely.

&gt;In other words, a witch-hunt will result, AP advocates
&gt; marginalized (if they are discovered).  My original reservations, on
&gt; the grounds of unjust means still stand, maybe we can return to this
&gt; discussion sometime later.

Why, is it becoming too hot?  Are you tempted to send the cops at Jim 
Bell's place?


&gt; "Religious" fanatics have great appeal, I don't think even AP will
&gt; make them "go away", the odds are they'll become martyrs.  And we
&gt; know where that takes us.

Against *whom* will they retaliate?  And more down to earth, I bet
that in the advent of AP becoming operationnal, their leaders will
go down even faster than our own.


&gt; I wasn't talking about the legal system in an AP world, but the idea
&gt; that AP is justice in some sense.

&gt; Incidentally, a purely civil law
&gt; court is what I'd like as well, and competing courts and arbitration
&gt; systems sound good to me.

Since you said yourself that the actual govt will *never* relinquish 
power, I find that statement a bit of a contradiction.
