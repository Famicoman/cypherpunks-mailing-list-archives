If there is any residual doubt as to why I'm proposing an "extreme" solution 
to government, "Assassination Politics," I think the following is just 
another good reason to do so.  I contend that people like that cop and the 
judge would be FAR more careful in how they do their job if they were aware 
they might be angering well over a half a million hams.  This kind of abuse 
will happen as long as there is no mechanism to prevent it.

&gt;Two sad things:
&gt;
&gt;1) Cops in some parts of Kentucky can't tell a scanner
&gt;when they see one (or don't see one, in this case), and
&gt;
&gt;2) the radio in question IS INCPABLE OF BEING MODIFIED TO
&gt;RECEIVE OUT OF BAND!!!!  Sheesh.

&gt;
&gt;TEEN HAM ARRESTED ON SCANNER CHARGES
&gt;
&gt;Greg Godsey, KF4BDY, a 16-year-old ham from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, was
&gt;arrested May 11 by local police who charged him with carrying a scanner that
&gt;could receive police radio frequencies. His Radio Shack HTX-202 2-meter
&gt;transceiver was confiscated. At a court appearance May 14, he was bound over
&gt;for trial on June 4. The judge reportedly didn't hear any arguments
&gt;concerning whether the law was broken, possibly because the arresting
&gt;officer wasn't present.
&gt;
&gt;According to reports, Greg, the ARES EC for Christian County, Kentucky, and
&gt;a ham since last summer, was detained by Hopkinsville Police. The officer
&gt;indicated that when he arrived, Greg "was talking on a radio that is capable
&gt;of receiving police frequencies. I verified this by keying my radio, which
&gt;broke the squelch on [Greg's] radio."
&gt;
&gt;Greg denies the charges and says his radio has not been modified and cannot
&gt;receive or transmit outside of the 2-meter band. He has sought advice from
&gt;the ARRL in resolving the matter. ARRL Regulatory Information Branch
&gt;Supervisor Norman Bliss, WA1CCQ, says the Kentucky law exempts equipment
&gt;possessed by a licensed Amateur Radio operator that is capable of receiving
&gt;police frequencies.
