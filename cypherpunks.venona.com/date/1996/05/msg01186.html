&gt; &gt;&gt; It was understandable to be poor when all the world was poor.  It is
&gt; &gt;&gt; understandable to be poor in those nations today that make the
&gt; &gt;&gt; accumulation of wealth a crime for most people.  It is not understandable
&gt; &gt;&gt; to be poor (for long) in the US where one can reliably get out of poverty
&gt; &gt;&gt; simply by doing three simple things:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) get a high school diploma
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) get married
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) get any job
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Only about 2 tenths of 1% of those who satisfy those three requirements
&gt; &gt;&gt; incomes below the official poverty line.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I've done all these things - and rather more in the way of education.  But
&gt; &gt;while I don't fall on or near the poverty line, I'm still poor as a church
&gt; &gt;mouse.  What am I doing wrong?

&gt; Q.E.D.

Ah, fair point.  England is not exactly a land of opportunity.  If it
were, there wouldn't be an America.  Perhaps my Irish ancestors should
have gone west rather than east.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I think Duncan's "high school + marriage + any job" point is a
&gt; bit simplistic, and I'm surprised about the ".02%" estimate. As someone
&gt; else noted, there are a lot of folks in the rural South, Appalachia, and
&gt; other places, who graduated from high school, are still married, and have
&gt; some sort of job, and yet who make $6-8 an hour or less.
&gt; 
&gt; I think more is needed. I would have added "savings/investment" and "hard work."
&gt; 
&gt; Those who can force themselves to set money aside for investment get the
&gt; compounded returns later on. And of course hard work--including taking a
&gt; second job, having the extended family work, etc.--is also key.
&gt; 
&gt; (Many immigrant Asians arrive penniless in the U.S., then get help from
&gt; immigrant Asian who arrived earlier, live in crowded houses and apartments,
&gt; have 4-6 wage-earners in a household, save as much as they can, and then
&gt; open a small business. Success is almost inevitable. Hence the cycle
&gt; continues. This tradition of the various Asian subcultures is almost
&gt; completely lacking in certain other subcultures in America. More's the
&gt; pity.)

&gt; Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
&gt; We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
