	The following may give an example of how companies and governments want
PICS to be used, instead of how it should be used (market-based ratings not
for censorship).

&gt;PARIS (May 9, 1996 12:41 p.m. EDT) -- A consortium of leading computer firms
&gt;launched a global rating system Thursday enabling parents to shield their
&gt;children from sexually explicit and violent material on the Internet.

&gt;The firms also hope the system will protect them from angry governments who
&gt;blame the largely unpoliced international computer network for bringing
&gt;pornographic material across their electronic borders.

&gt;"We do believe it will provide legal protection in a situation where adult
&gt;material is being distributed to minors," said Andrew Gray, European general
&gt;manager of CompuServe. "It will very much strengthen our position in these
&gt;kind of situations."

&gt;The system, an industry standard known as PICS -- for Platform for Internet
&gt;Content Selection -- has been in the works for nearly a year, and will take
&gt;several more months to become a useful tool for parents and educators, its
&gt;primary targets.

&gt;Under the system, 39 internet-related firms including giants America Online,
&gt;CompuServe, Microsoft, Prodigy and Netscape Communications will soon give
&gt;their customers software enabling them to block access to material they
&gt;judge objectionable on the Internet's Worldwide Web.

&gt;The software will enable parents and teachers to filter out pages according
&gt;to their own choice of level of violence, sex, nudity and language.

&gt;At the same time, providers will be urged to rate their pages by filling out
&gt;an electronic questionnaire resulting in a "grade" for each site, on a scale
&gt;ranging from zero, the most innocuous, to four for each category.

	What was I saying about pressure to rate?

&gt;The system depends for its ratings on voluntary compliance by Internet
&gt;providers. However parents will also have the option of simply blocking out
&gt;all unrated pages, simply by checking an electronic box on their computer
&gt;screens.

	This is, of course, assuming that "Internet content providers" won't
simply rate their pages as suitable for all ages.

[...]

&gt;But there is no way to use the system to seek out pornography or violence on
&gt;the web, officials insisted.

	Yeah, right.

&gt;"To content-providers, I would say, 'Rate your sites' To parents I would
&gt;say, 'Set the levels for your children.' And to governments, I would say
&gt;humbly, 'Think again before censoring the net,"' Stephen Balkam, executive
&gt;director of the Recreational Software Advisory Council, told a news
&gt;conference.

	Note again the pressure for self-rating.

&gt;"CompuServe supports selection and not censorship, empowerment and not
&gt;restriction," Gray said, announcing that his firm would begin distributing
&gt;the necessary software to customers in July.

&gt;Netscape, whose Netscape Navigator Internet-browsing software is the most
&gt;widely used in the world, will begin offering a new version incorporating
&gt;the ratings capability by the end of the year, Technology Director Martin
&gt;Haeberli said.

&gt;"Parents and educators must have some way, some tool, to enable them to
&gt;moderate what is available," Haeberli said.

	Only if you approve of parental censorship.

&gt;Internet firms around the globe have been under the gun from governments to
&gt;better police their offerings that offend local sensibilities, which vary
&gt;considerably from country to country.

&gt;A strength of PICS is that "it allows as many countries as would like to set
&gt;up a rating system," said Jim Miller, a research scientist who helped
&gt;develop the system. Adhering to the system would still be up to individual
&gt;households, however.

	Whatever became of market-ratings? Admittedly, they may mean that each
country will be encouraged to given an example system... but I still don't
like the idea of government involvement.
