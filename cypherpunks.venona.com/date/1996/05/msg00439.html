OTC  05/06 1518  ADVISORY/International Money  Laundering ...

 (May 6) BUSINESS WIRE -May 6, 1996--With attendees coming from across the
United States and from Latin and South America, more than 200 people are
expected to participate in the Third International Money Laundering Conference
May 15 and 16 in Miami. 
   The likely attendance is the largest since the conference was first held in
1993. 
   "New federal rules and laws, as well as concerns about emerging techniques to
launder money, such as using the Internet, are generating intense interest,"
said Charles A. Intriago, publisher of Money Laundering Alert and a leading
authority on the subject. 
   Money Laundering Alert is co-sponsoring the conference with America Lawyer
Media, which publishes American Lawyer magazine and operates the Court TV
network.  ALM also publishes the Daily Business Review in South Florida. 
   This year's conference will include panel discussions on sush topics as ways
to detect and counter new forms of money laundering including so-called
"cyberlaundering" and trade laundering; the "alphabet soup" of world money
control rules, laws and organizations; cooperative blueprints for financial
institutions and governments to prevent money laundering; hidden traps in U.S.
laws, new suspicious reporting rules and the workings of the U.S. Office of
Foreign Assets Control. 
   Speakers include officials from the IRS, SEC, FBI, Federal Reserve, Office of
the Comptroller, Justice Department and other government agencies, as well as
private-sector bankers, lawyers and academic experts.  Among the panelists this
year are Senior U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler of Miami, the presiding
judge in the federal government's money laundering case against former
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, Gerald F. McDowell, chief, asset forfeiture
and money laundering section of the U.S. Justice Department, Richard A. Small,
special counsel, Federal Reserve Board, and John J. Byrne, senior legislative
counsel for the American Bankers Association. 
   The two-day session will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown
Miami. Information on conference attendance can be obtained by calling Money
Laundering Alert at 800/232-3652, or 305/530-0500 (Fax 305/530-9434).
