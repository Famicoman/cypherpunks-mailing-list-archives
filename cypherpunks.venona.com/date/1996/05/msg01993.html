This was, well, interesting.  As a result of the recent loss
of many remailers, I started looking for a local (to me)
ISP that would offer me an anonymous account, and/or a shell
account.  Nobody would offer me a shell account except for
these people, and here's what they had to say about
an anonymous account...

The policy is set and I am not going to argue with you about it.  I 
explained that we do not feel that anyone needs to be doing things that
they do not want their name attached to on the Internet, and for that
reason do not offer anonymous accounts.  You have offered no reason to
change the policy.  I regret that we are unable to offer service to you.

Subject: 	anonymity/corporate policy

&gt; Corporate policy dictates that we do not offer anonymous
&gt; accounts. It is corporate belief that there should be no
&gt; reason anyone needs anonymity on the net

That's an, er, interesting policy.  Although there are
a great number of arguments for anonymity - and privacy -
I won't try to persuade an obviously uninterested audience.
(That's you.)  I'd like to see the relevant corporate
policies; are they available at www.igateway.net or elsewhere?
Also, is there a more precise rationale behind the decision?

I'd very much like to do business with you, but if you
don't want my money, that's cool.
