&gt;REGIONAL BELLS WANT RATE HIKES FOR WIRING SCHOOLS
&gt;The United States Telephone Association would like to raise the average U.S.
&gt;monthly phone bill by about $10 over the next five years to pay for wiring
&gt;schools and libraries with new lines for phones and computers, and to
&gt;subsidize poor and rural customers.  The proposal assumes an $11 billion
&gt;cost for wiring schools and libraries, with local phone companies paying
&gt;about a third to a half of that.  The rest would come from a surcharge on
&gt;other services, such as cellular.  "No single industry should be held
&gt;responsible for fulfilling this major goal," says USTA's president.  "Each
&gt;has a role and should make a significant contribution to the national
&gt;education technology mandate."  (Investor's Business Daily 8 May 96 A7)

	The "subsidize poor and rural customers" line makes me glad I don't
have a phone line.

&gt;ALLIANCE SEEKS ELECTRONIC SECURITY
&gt;An alliance of software companies has established the Electronic Licensing
&gt;and Security Initiative to develop a system that uses electronic tokens
&gt;linked to a software package to securely track software rentals, licenses
&gt;and purchases.  The group also plans to develop an electronic clearinghouse
&gt;to provide and track licenses.  Several major software producers, including
&gt;Microsoft, IBM and AT&amp;T have said they will support the Initiative's
&gt;technology.  (Wall Street Journal 6 May 96 B6)

	Anyone know how this is supposed to work? It sounds like a
non-anonymous digital cash system, in essence.

&gt;IBM'S INFOMARKET TOLL BOOTH
&gt;IBM has persuaded some 30 companies, including Eastman Kodak, Xerox,
&gt;Reuters, America Online and Yahoo!, to use its new infoMarket
&gt;electronic-content clearinghouse for displaying and distributing their
&gt;wares.  The infoMarket concept requires customers to pay for only what they
&gt;use, with the content providers controlling the information and setting
&gt;their own prices.  "Charging only for what you want is a very attractive
&gt;scheme," says one electronic database provider.  The system is based on
&gt;"Cryptolopes" -- secure electronic packaging that, when opened, bind the
&gt;user to a contractual agreement regarding the use of the content.  If the
&gt;content is distributed beyond that agreement, the technology can track its
&gt;usage and bill the original purchaser for subsequent viewings.  "It's a
&gt;complete break from all other ways information has been published on the Net
&gt;to date," says an industry consultant.  "It turns pass-along from a business
&gt;threat to a business opportunity."  (Business Week 13 May 96 p114)

	Again, it's not clear how this is supposed to work. It does remind me
of that information-network thing that was promoted on the Extropian lists,
except that didn't have any provisions on reuse.
