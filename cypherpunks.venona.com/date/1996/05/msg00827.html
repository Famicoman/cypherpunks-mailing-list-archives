You should have... 

&gt; Who says they make a choice
&gt; to live in rural areas? 

Why? were they lobotomized?

&gt; Do they also choose not to have enough money
&gt; to pay for shoes?

You got to choose to do what is needed to live a better life.  And 
most of them ain't doing what it takes.

&gt; So, because they live in a poor district they are
&gt; not entitled to the same level of education as a rich city suburb? 
&gt; The illiteracy rate in Alabama is 40%! This is just plain sick!

When I was a kid, everything that had characters printed on it was 
readable.  Who is *preventing* them from reading?

&gt; But the statement that we shouldn't subsidize
&gt; rural customers because they CHOOSE to live there (even though some
&gt; are poor and can't afford to live anywhere else) is just plain
&gt; fallacious.
Please, substantiate your claims with in-context arguments.

&gt; Just because you choose to live in the city does not
&gt; mean people always choose to live where they live.
Who cast their feet in concrete blocks?


&gt; Education is one
&gt; thing (perhaps the only thing) that deserves to be subsidized in
&gt; this country. 
I think that it should not be subsidized.
If you feel like subsidising education, then by all means, do it.  
But why should you stick a gun in my back to do the same?  What if I 
do not want to do the same as you?

&gt; the tone of
&gt; the above message is callous, besides being wrong.
In *my* opinion, it is right on the money.  But if you can stand 
reality, then I understand why you rant...

BTW, I do not understand the "logics" that want to bring everybody 
down because some individuals are down.  This is a system that punish 
achievement for being achievement and value meekness for itself.
A total, anti-life aberration.
