&gt; 	In regards to accepting the risk themselves, look at what happens when

&gt; Huntington's as an example. If genetic screening is prohibited to insurance
&gt; companies, someone who has a test and finds out that they've got the allele
&gt; for Huntington's, and thus will get sick and die from it, is going to go down
&gt; and get themselves insurance. Then the insurance - e.g., everyone else who
&gt; buys from that insurance company - will have to pay for them when they need
&gt; several years of nursing care before dying. How is this fair to everyone else,
&gt; including the insurance company?

I'm sure you know the law and practice better, but my insurance seems to
have a "preexisting conditions" clause. Knowingly doing the above
constitutes fraud. (Of course lots of people probably get away with it.)

Moreover, when the insurance company pays out, that ultimately comes out
of premiums. I don't have Huntington's, but I don't mind paying an extra
$X into a risk pool for people with Huntington's because it means I don't
have to submit to genetic screening, either. You don't have to have
something to hide to see it as an invasion of privacy. It's a pool of
consumers establishing preferences, not just individual consumers v. 
producers. The meaning of microeconomics changes as it scales.

&gt; 	You spoke of fairness. Capitalism isn't fair; neither is life. Someone

[Yawn]

By "fairness" I meant that equal risks should be treated equally. Cost of
disease A = cost of disease B. The detection of predisposition to disease
A is politically feasible, but the same isn't true for disease B. I'd say
you were discriminating against people predisposed to disease A, because
they're paying into the risk pool for B, but B isn't paying into the risk
pool for A.
