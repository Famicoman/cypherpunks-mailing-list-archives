I've uploaded a letter-formatted version of the paper as well now.
(Or I hope so at least, can't try it here since we only have A4 paper.)

I have also put the original FrameMaker document there, as well as 
a small presentation in PowerPoint about the topic. Take a look at
<A  HREF="http://www.it.kth.se/~cwe/phd/">http://www.it.kth.se/~cwe/phd/</A> for more information.

I've read briefly previously about KeyKOS, I believe it was in IEEE
Symp on Sec &amp; Priv, or something like that.

I'll take a closer look at KeyKOS. It is interesting to find others
doing similar things, since it is quite hard to find previous work
in the area. (I've digged through Comm of ACM all the way back to
1969 for material. Sigh! :-))

I have experiences from UNIX, and I would say that a large number of the
security problems in the daemons are due to the fact that the programmer
did not succeed in keeping data from different subjects separated. This is
today solved by ad hoc methods by the programmer, and the task is too
difficult.

One of the things I want to examine is how fast a subject's influence
is spreading through the program during execution. I'm worried that the
influence in general is not contained, and that one either has to have
a very intelligent compiler or have to rewrite most programs to take
advantage of the scheme. I hope to be able to straighten out this question
mark during the coming months.
