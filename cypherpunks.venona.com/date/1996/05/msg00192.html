&gt; &gt; For a good demonstration of why WhoWhere? is not necessarily the greatest
&gt; &gt; thing since spice racks, look up "Louis Freeh," "Fuck You,"  "Asshole,"
&gt; &gt; "System Privileged User," and "Stephen Hawking." I keep telling them that
&gt; &gt; they'd better remove this last, but they don't consider it a priority.
&gt;
&gt;     If you want further evidence of their technical skills, look up
&gt;my name.  I'm responsible for the corp@spe.com account.  WhoWhere has
&gt;therefore decided that I am responsible for every "corp" account in
&gt;their database and has attached my name to each and every one.  I
&gt;informed them of this several weeks ago but they are evidently not
&gt;interested in cleaning up their service.
&gt;
&gt;     Being both socially and technically challenged, perhaps they want
&gt;your Fucking Statist input on obtaining a government grant for a
&gt;clue-free business.

I agree with my namesake that WhoWhere is one incredibly fucked-up operation.

I tried to add an entry for myself, and my entry has (after several days)
not made it. (I tried to be truthful, including such things as "felon" for
what I do...perhasp their Thought Police considered my entry a joke,
suggesting that they must be applying their own judgment to entries.)

I then figured that some of their "automatically generated" entries for
"Timothy C. May" needed correction. Not suprisingly, the system asked for a
password, so I was unable to correct their defective entries for me.

Fuck em. Then burn the body.
