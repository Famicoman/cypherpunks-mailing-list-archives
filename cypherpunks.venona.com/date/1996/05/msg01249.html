ABOUT THE CONFERENCE

Background

     1996 is likely to be a pivotal year for the introduction of electronic
banking and commerce in the United States. Among the major developments that

will mark 1996 as an historic year in this field are:

     The Federal Reserve Board proposes the first major regulatory
initiative to address the treatment of stored value products.

     Stored value cards are introduced to the public in a television
commercial seen by millions during the Super Bowl followed by a high
visibility pilot project during the Atlanta Summer Olympics.

     Visa and Mastercard reach agreement on protocol for secure transmission

of credit card information over the Internet.

     Electronic cash becomes available for transmission over the
Internet.

     Banks and software providers engage in a major effort to attract bank
customers to on-line banking services.

     Usage of the World Wide Web for product marketing expands
exponentially.

     Landmark telecommunications reform legislation is enacted.

     These developments present both an opportunity and a challenge for
banks, financial services firms, technology providers and a wide range of
commercial enterprises.  The construction of the electronic financial
services delivery system of the 21st Century will be driven by technology
and will require a comprehensive reevaluation and realignment of consumer
preferences, privacy, security, costs and conveniences.  Simultaneously,
these new delivery systems will be directly affected by emerging government
regulation related to law enforcement, monetary policy, bank regulation and
consumer protection.  The conference is designed to provide participants
with a broad insight into these factors, to hear from the leaders who will
drive this process and thus offer participants a basis for evaluating the
near and long term prospects for the banking industry and other financial
services providers in the new world of electronic commerce.
