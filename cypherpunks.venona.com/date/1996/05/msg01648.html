&gt;&gt;I am interested in your paper because you define the problem as we do.
&gt;&gt;There are some who think that capability architectures are the solution.
&gt;&gt;There is little information on how to solve these problems with
&gt;&gt;capabilities. I am trying to find time to address some of these issues.
&gt;
&gt;I walked away from your presentation of KeyKOS with the impression that a
&gt;capability system to be secure it would have to be implemented at the OS
&gt;level.
&gt;Can you build a such a system on top of an insecure OS, as Java would have
&gt;to do?

Let me take a couple of stabs at this question.

A lot of the answer depends on what you mean by secure.  For example, if
the Java run-time can successfully contain Java applets so they can't
access any of the unsecured portions of your OS, then it doesn't matter
that those OS holes exist as far as protection from the applets is
concerned.  The proof that the Java run-time actually can do this
containment is left as an exercise for the student :-).

Capabilities could be used to give specific Java applets access to specific
resources on your computer system.  e.g. You could give an applet the
capability to read a file.  In the Java world it would appear as an object
with only one method (read).  The specific applet object instances which
had access to that object could read the file.  Others could not.


A slightly different view of where capabilities might fit in is on a
network of mutually suspicious actors (e.g. the global Internet).  Start by
assuming that each machine is strongly resistant to attack through the
network.  (Ironically, Mac/Wintel platforms may be easier to secure in this
manner than Unix platforms because they have fewer of the compromised
network daemons running.  Firewalls already allow Unix networks to approach
this level of security.)  In this model, you must either trust or contain
all the code you run on your machine.

We can use certificates (ref: SPKI) to implement network capabilities. 
These certificates make statements of the form: The holder of the secret
key which corresponds to this public key is permitted these specific forms
of access to this specific resource on this location (e.g. a URL).  These
certificates can act like capabilities.  They can be passed by creating a
new certificate for the receiver which gives it the privileges implied by
the old certificate.  They can be rescinded in any of a number of ways.

Capability certificates allow you to give access to specific resources on
your machine with public key authentication to prevent spoofing.  Because
they support one or more techniques for the holder to pass the capability
to others, they allow subcontracting computation to other machines in the
network.

I will note in passing that ACLs do not allow for subcontracting.
