&gt;                     *Ban on "Offensive" Comments Ruled Vague*

&gt;SAN FRANCISCO -- A state law against "offensive" personal comments by lawyers
&gt;was ruled unconstitutionally vague Friday for the second time, despite the
&gt;State Bar's attempt to define it, the Associated Press reports.

&gt;The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals first struck the law down in April
&gt;1995, overturning a disciplinary order against a Los Angeles attorney who
&gt;denounced women lawyers, the AP reported. In a 3-0 ruling, the court said the
&gt;law was so broad and undefined that lawyers wouldn't know when they were
&gt;violating it.

&gt;The panel granted a rehearing last December to give the state and the State
&gt;Bar, not previously parties, a chance to defend the law.

&gt;The bar cited its new policy, adopted in October, that said the law would be
&gt;enforced only against conduct in a courtroom or similar setting, such as a
&gt;sworn deposition, that was so serious as to be "prejudicial to the
&gt;administration of justice." They also said the law merely enforced an ethical
&gt;code that lawyers were required to know as part of their profession.

&gt;The court was unpersuaded, AP said, reaffirming its previous decision in a
&gt;2-1 ruling.

&gt;The case involved a disciplinary order against attorney Frank L. Swan, who
&gt;wrote an angry note in May 1993 to a female prosecutor who had gotten him
&gt;removed from a case. He attached the following statement to the note,
&gt;photocopied from a magazine article:

&gt;"Male lawyers play by the rules, discover truth and restore order. Female
&gt;lawyers are outside the law, cloud truth and destroy order."

&gt;In overturning the disciplinary order, the appeals court said the note showed
&gt;a "patently sexist attitude'' but did not impugn the female prosecutor's
&gt;integrity or interfere with the administration of justice.

&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union defended Swan. The National Organization
&gt;for Women was among those opposing him.

	One notices that the court did not strike this down on the obvious
grounds of free speech. I believe this may be an example of a law, not
struck down on such grounds, that fits TCMay's description that Rich
disputed.

&gt;                                 *Clinton Expands National ID*

&gt;Seeking to further demonstrate its tough stance against illegal immigration,
&gt;the Clinton Administration announced Thursday a national expansion of a pilot
&gt;program in California that requires participating employers to verify the
&gt;legal status of job seekers, according to a front page article in the New
&gt;York Times.

&gt;Specifically, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reached agreement
&gt;with the nation's four largest meat-packing companies (representing 80
&gt;percent of the industry's 70,000 employees) to use a computerized data system
&gt;at 41 plants in 12 Western and Midwestern states to determine if job
&gt;applicants are documented workers.

&gt;The ACLU and other civil libertarians have long criticized the plan, saying
&gt;it would lead to an costly, intrusive and error-prone national identification
&gt;card.

&gt;The effort announced today builds on the seven-month-old pilot program in two
&gt;Southern California counties, Santa Ana and the City of Industry.  

&gt;Meanwhile, immigration bills approved by the House and the Senate, and now
&gt;awaiting resolution in a conference committee, include differing provisions
&gt;that would expand pilot programs even further to allow the INS to more
&gt;quickly evaluate among different systems.  

&gt;"These pilot programs all lead down the same path," said Greg T. Nojeim, an
&gt;ACLU Legislative Counsel.  "Unless the public steps up its pressure to stop
&gt;them from proceeding, the government will build a giant computer registry
&gt;that will require every single hiring decision in this country to be cleared
&gt;through a centralized database."
