(1) Your Privacy Online - CDT Unveils Demonstration &amp; Clearinghouse

Many people surf the World Wide Web with an illusion of anonymity,
believing that their activities are unobserved and that they can explore
the Internet without leaving a trail.  In reality, this is not the case.

During the normal course of using the Internet, a great deal of personally
revealing information is routinely generated, collected, and stored.  Most
of this information is collected for purposes of system maintenance,
billing, or other necessary functions.  But a sophisticated marketer,
determined hacker, or law enforcement official can put together a detailed
profile of your online activities, personal tastes, interests, habits and
vices with relative ease.

Today, the Center for Democracy and Technology unveiled an interactive
privacy demonstration and privacy policy clearinghouse on our World Wide
Web site. The demonstration is located at

                    <A  HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/">http://www.cdt.org/privacy/</A>

The goals of the demonstration are two fold:

1. To educate the public about the extent to which personal information
   is automatically revealed online, and

2. To begin to make available examples of privacy and information usage
   policies that give people greater knowledge of and control over the
   personal information revealed online.  The current focus of this
   "Privacy Clearinghouse" is centered on commercial online service
   providers (ie, America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, Microsoft).

Future updates of the clearinghouse will include information on Internet
Service Providers, content providers, and web browser software.  Future
updates will also explore the extent that users can employ various
technological solutions to control the collection and disclosure of personal
information.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION TO HOLD HEARINGS ON ONLINE PRIVACY

On June 4 and 5, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will hold hearings to
explore online privacy issues.  The FTC is particularly interested in
exploring privacy protecting technologies which empower users to exercise
more control over the collection and use of personally identifiable
information online.

CDT has been invited to present testimony at the hearings.  Testimony and
other background information on the FTC hearings will be available at CDT's
web page at the end of next week. Details on the hearings are available at
<A  HREF="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</A>.

WHY SHOULD NETIZENS CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE?

Although it may not seem like it, someone is following you through
cyberspace.  Every time you retrieve a file, view an image, send an email
message or jump to a new web site, a record is created somewhere on the
Net.

While much of this information may never be used, it can be, and you have
little control over it.  In the hands of a marketer with a powerful
computer, or the government, it is possible to build a detailed profile of
your tastes and preferences by monitoring your online activities.

The information can be used to send you unsolicited email or snail mail, to
call you, or to even put you on a list of people likely to support a
particular political candidate.  A single piece of information about you
can support a tremendous range of activities.  For example, if your
repeated visits to web sites containing information on cigarettes results
in free samples, coupons, or even email to you about a new tobacco product,
you may not be concerned.  However, if your visits to these web sites
result in escalating insurance premiums due to categorization as a smoker -
now you're beginning to get concerned.

HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ONLINE

Web sites and Web browsers
--------------------------

Your personal information (including your hobbies, political and product
interests and ways to contact you, such as your email address) can be
collected by web sites in two ways: directly or indirectly.

* PASSIVE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION:  The transactional
  information revealed in the normal course of surfing the net reveals a
  great deal of information about your online activities. When you visit
  a particular web site, for example, the webmaster can determine what
  files, pictures, or other information you are most interested in (and
  what you ignored), how long you examined a particular page, image or
  file, where you came from, where you went to.

  Web servers collect transactional information in order to allow the
  system operator to perform necessary system maintenance, auditing, and
  other essential system functions.  However, when correlated with other
  sources of personal information, including marketing databases, phone
  books, voter registration lists, etc, a detailed profile of your
  online activities can be created without your knowledge or consent.

* COOKIES: Additionally, many web browsers contain a feature called
  "cookies," or client-side persistent information.  Cookies allows any
  web site to store information about your visit to that site on your
  hard drive.  Every time you return to that site, "cookies" will read
  your hard drive to find out if you've been there before. (The Privacy
  Demonstration has a link to a site that utilizes cookies.)

* DIRECT DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION: A growing number of web
  sites offer users the ability to register with the site.  In many
  cases, registration brings real, important benefits, such as access to
  special areas, timely information, discounts, etc.  While registration
  or other mechanisms by which users divulge personal information to a
  web site provide some obvious benefits to a users, it also provides
  the site's operator with a detailed picture of how you use the site.

Regardless of how the information is obtained, a great deal of personally
identifiable information is revealed in the normal course of surfing the
web.

Commercial Online Service Providers
-----------------------------------

Commercial online service providers are configured in a variety of ways,
but generally, little personally identifiable information is revealed to
Internet sites visited directly from an online service.

If you subscribe to a commercial online service, your service provider has
access to lots of information about your online activities.  These records
are generated in the normal course of using the service, and are important
for billing and maintenance purposes.  However, not all services treat the
use and disclosure of this information the same way.

Please visit The Center for Democracy and Technology's Clearinghouse on
Privacy Policies (<A  HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/">http://www.cdt.org/privacy/</A>) for a detailed description of
the information practices of the major commercial online services.

Future updates of the clearinghouse will focus on other Internet entities,
such as browsers, content providers, and Internet service providers.
