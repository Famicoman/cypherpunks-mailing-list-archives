&gt; I responded to Skippy's on-topic, more or less substantive questions about
&gt; remailers in Message-ID
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="msg01044.html">Pine.GUL.3.93.960518010958.19939C-100000@Networking.Stanford.EDU</A>&gt;
&gt; This has absolutely nothing to do with crypto, but that's what I
&gt; subscribed to coderpunks for.

&gt; &gt; Ask him about SPLC, Seraw vs WAR, Tom, John METZGER.
&gt; 
&gt; I grew up 15 minutes from Metzger and played soccer with one of his kids,
&gt; and he threatened some friends of mine.  I've talked to his sidekick Wyatt
&gt; Kaldenberg about other things, and defended their absolute right to free
&gt; speech on occasion. But other than that, I don't know much about Metzger.
&gt; Skippy seems to have this illusion that I'm some big bad anti-racist,
&gt; which I find amusing. 

Another non-rebutted rebuttal.  I care nothing about yours or
Metzgers personal life, this is FAR ramnificated severity.

And, the anology I made CLEARLY was the similarity between 
Co$ and SPLC; And the VICTIMS: WAR and Wollersheim,Fishman,etc.
CO$ AND WAR DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE!!!:

&gt; Another WAR/CoS mal-analogy one could scrawl is that Metzger has paid
&gt; about as much of the judgement awarded to the murder victim's family as
&gt; CoS has paid to Wollersheim. But I wouldn't follow that line of reasoning

&gt; Seraw murder case, but their current suit agaist Pierce's neo-Nazi
&gt; National Alliance seems rather SLAPP-ish to me.  I'm sure Morty would try

SPLC vs WAR set the SHOCKING precedent.

&gt; to justify going after deep-pocket racists by saying that they deserve it
&gt; because the $4.5 million or so that The Order White Nationalist
&gt; Revolutionary [cough] Movement liberated from banks and convenience stores
&gt; has never been recovered, but he's wrong. Sure Bobby claimed to be doing

ADL claimed $50,000 was funneled to NA from the beginning.
No proof whatsoever, as they havn't pressed the matter to proceedings.

&gt; those robberies in the name of the Aryan Cause, but it looks like he
&gt; really spent the money on himself, just like any other "political" crook
&gt; (the Contras, the FMLN, Sendero, the Machateros, the US Congress, etc).

You mean he laundered the money right before his death, and
his hiers got it all?  WOW!  What a Don!

&gt; The SPLC probably has a web server somewhere with more details, but
&gt; there's a minimal amount of information about the case at:
&gt; 
&gt;  <A  HREF="http://www.almanac.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ftp.pl?people/m/metzger.tom">http://www.almanac.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ftp.pl?people/m/metzger.tom</A>
&gt;  <A  HREF="http://www.almanac.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ftp.pl?orgs/american/war">http://www.almanac.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ftp.pl?orgs/american/war</A>

These say nothing.  SPLC has avoided the net, because
it's two periodicals are so embarrassing to the anti-racists.
You need to go to the library and check up on Klanwatch
for the years 89-93 for the sordid details.

&gt; Tom Metzger's web page (sorry, it's actually John Metzger's web page,
&gt; which happens to carry all sorts of stuff from Tom -- you see, facing a 
&gt; $10 court judgement upheld by the Supreme Court, Tom has sworn an oath of

$10,200,000!!!!   25% of income confiscated for 20 years!!!

&gt; poverty to avoid giving the Zionist Occupational Government any more
&gt; blood money)  is at:

Ignoroid, ALL the Metzger funds are being transfered with
the large mulatto Seraw family as sole beneficiary.
Co$/SPLC political harassment cases are NOT done to
raise funds, but suppress organisation.
