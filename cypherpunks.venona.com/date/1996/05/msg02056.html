&gt;Hi, I'm not sure if there was ever a thread on this, but I was wondering if 
&gt;anyone can determine your real email address, if you were to fake it to your 
&gt;email client.
&gt;
&gt;I hope that this doesn't offend anyone, since this is a high traffic list, but 
&gt;I was wondering if this would work.  To try it out, I setup my client to think 
&gt;I was someone else, and sent myself an email.  I could only figure out what 
&gt;ISP it came from.
&gt;
&gt;What I would like to know is, can any of the experts on this list determine my 
&gt;address from the header of this post??
I didn't receive anything except your nobody@... address.
&gt;again, if this is something that I shouldn't have done, just let me know, and 
&gt;it won't happen again.
&gt;
 Hmmm... I'm going to have to play around with this. I can get outbound email access 
through my school district's mailserver simply by filling in the appropriate fields in 
netscape (we have a WAN hooked up to a T1).  It would seem to me that this would be rather 
secure for several reasons, if for no other than that NO logging is made... In a large 
district, like mine (probably 10-15 thousand potential users), I doubt they would have the 
resources to track any of the 100 or so Internet machines on my campus alone, even if they 
could tell it came from here.
