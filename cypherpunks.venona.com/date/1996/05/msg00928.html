&gt; 
&gt; I can just visualize a trusted party dropping discretely a bright
&gt; yellow Caterpillar D-12 in a dead letter box... ROTFL!

When the NSA ordered large workstations from a supplier they had the
supplier leave them at a motel parking lot in Maryland.

Many such stories exist in the intelligence community.

That's standard procedure for some appropriations where the instalation
location is secret and the vendor is untrusted or marginally trusted.

If you have two trusted parties, and the transaction is secret then unless
you have a mole or something else, who is going to say the item was sold?
Leave semi-trailer in truck stop parking lot, second cab comes and picks
it up and drives away.  This too hard to comprehend?

&gt; Sorry, but I couldn't resist.  I just *love* silly humor...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Realization means that their is a changing of hands or of forms of
&gt; &gt; assets. Income tax and taxes on currency now are dependent on such
&gt; &gt; transactions. Someone already noted the problems with just taxing
&gt; &gt; possession on a given date of e.g., inventory.  To tax efficiently
&gt; &gt; you have to tax an event of transfer.
&gt; 
&gt; Why? is it because of the nature of a transfer, it lend itself more 
&gt; to reporting and detecting?  Or is it simply because of the legal 
&gt; system structure?

All three.

&gt; &gt; That's that anonymous transactions are for. 
&gt; 
&gt; If anonymous transactions are feasible, so will be the AP scheme...
&gt; AP can be, in a way, characterized as a weapon because it behaves
&gt; like one.  And no weapon in the history of humanity remained unused. 

No.  I have an anonymous transaction with you.  You feel I cheated you.
Who are you going to direct the massive jaugernaut of the AP machine
against?  Eh?
  
&gt; &gt; I forwarded two large segments of the work to the list, yes.  If
&gt; &gt; you, or anyone else on the list, would like copies, let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Theses were the first two that constitued part 1 of 4.  I wondered if 
&gt; you posted the other parts.  If so, tell me so I can get to the 
&gt; archives.

No, and I don't believe I will be posting them.
