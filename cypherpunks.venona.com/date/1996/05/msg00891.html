&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It might be interesting to make a list of all the problems people can
&gt;&gt; think of why this idea won't work, paired with proposed solutions and
&gt;&gt; workarounds - sort of a mini FAQ for this important (some might say
&gt;&gt; ultimate) cypherpunk model.
&gt;&gt; .....................................................................
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think this is a much needed discussion  - in particular as it comes at a
&gt;&gt;time when Uni is is "somewhat disconcerted" at the defeatist attitude of some
&gt;&gt;cypherpunks and since TCMay is getting ready to read us the Cypherpunks Bill
&gt;&gt;of Rights regarding the subsidizatoin of other's people's cyber existence
&gt;&gt;(heh). 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 3 problems which immediately come to mind:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; .  What if someone, hired on one occasion but fired at another, decides
&gt;in anger to "turn coat" and report everyone to the IRS (or other fine
&gt;government agency)?
&gt;
&gt;The entire organization would clearly have to be double blinded.  If this
&gt;can be done for mailing lists (which I believe it can) it can be done for
&gt;corporations too.  The real trick is getting the costs of anonymous (and I
&gt;mean secure anonymous) communications low enough.

If all you need to do is beat the cost of commuting 20 miles/day, no problem.


&gt;&gt; .  What if a company does not pay as expected - other than adopting
&gt;&gt; Assassination Politics, what method could an employee use towards
&gt;&gt; getting their expected remuneration for work done?
&gt;
&gt;If payment is made weekly, it should be made in advance to an escrow agent
&gt;who would issue a certificate that the payment for employee r2dd54 has
&gt;been received.  The payment would then not be released to anyone without
&gt;the consent of the corporation and the employee.
&gt;
&gt;Obviously the escrow agent would have to be trusted.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Even if a payment gets hung up in a dispute, it's only for a week.

You could require daily payment and forgo the escrow agent.  (Assuming you
are willing to risk a day's pay as an experiment in reputation.)  Note that
AP won't work if everyone is anonymous because you won't have a target.


What may be a problem for such a company is a social problem.  All the
creative groups I have worked with have had close personal relations. 
(Although they have not had wide agreement on significant non-work
subjects!)  I don't know if good, creative, group-produced products can be
built without such a relationship.  Does anyone know of an example of such
a product from an "anonymous" environment?
