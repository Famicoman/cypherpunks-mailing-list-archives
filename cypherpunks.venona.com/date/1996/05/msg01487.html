        Someone's forgetting that it would be smart - and should be possible -
for the men in question also to be anonymous/pseudonymous. As it was, they
could have been, and were evidently too dumb. Edited for fair use.

&gt;Kansas veterinarian extorts husbands on 'married but looking' chat line

&gt;(May 21, 1996 10:41 p.m. EDT) Men flirted shamelessly with "Rita" in 
&gt;America Online's "Married But Looking" computer chat line. The typed chatter 
&gt;often got steamy, and she even offered them provocative photos of herself.

&gt;But some men found that "she" was a "he" -- with printed copies of their
&gt;explicit exchanges and blackmail on his mind.

&gt;Veterinarian Ron Hornbaker, 29, of Shawnee Mission, Kan., pleaded guilty to
&gt;extortion Tuesday in a case that some say illustrates problems in the
&gt;unpoliced Internet. He faces two years in prison and fines up to $250,000.

&gt;"It's an old crime, just new tools," said assistant U.S. Attorney John
&gt;McKenzie, who prosecuted the case in U.S. District Court in Rockford, Ill.

[...]

&gt;In August 1995, Hornbaker created an America Online profile of himself as a
&gt;married woman named Rita, authorities say. He would log into "Married But
&gt;Looking" or similar chat areas and start engaging male victims in typed
&gt;conversation. After a while, he would ask them to go to a more confidential
&gt;area called a private chat room "to get to know each other better.

&gt;"There Rita would engage each man in erotic conversation, asking the victim
&gt;to get her "hot" and offering a sexy photograph.

&gt;Hornbaker, meanwhile, stored the conversation and printed out transcripts.
&gt;Victims awaiting the nude photograph instead got a threatening letter. In it,
&gt;Hornbaker -- now posing as Rita's enraged husband -- said he'd found a
&gt;transcript of the conversation between the victim and Rita.

&gt;Hornbaker set up boxes at private mail services to handle the bribes,
&gt;usually between $500 and $2,000. None of the recipients paid him.
