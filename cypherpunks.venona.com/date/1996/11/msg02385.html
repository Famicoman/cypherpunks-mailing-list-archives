This thread is probably already due for a change in
the Subject line, but I'll leave it untouched for 
the moment.

&gt; &gt; I don't see any reason why this wouldn't be true for a
&gt; &gt; computer. Fed.Rul.Crim.Pro. 41(b)(1) allows the seizure 
&gt; &gt; (but seizure is not forfeiture) of "property that 
&gt; &gt; constitutes evidence of the commission of a
&gt; &gt; criminal offense". 
&gt; 
&gt; It is true of computers.
&gt; Take the case of Ripco (the Chicago BBS raided in the 
&gt; SunDevil raids back when).
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think "Dr. Ripco" has yet gotten his equipment 
&gt; back.  I don't know for sure, but what I do know is 
&gt; that 5 years after the raid, he still had certainly 
&gt; not gotten anything back.
[....] 
&gt; Recall also that Ripco was never specifically charged 
&gt; (or the minor charges that they did try to pin didn't 
&gt; stick).
&gt; 
&gt; Also recall that Ripco (now ripco.com) was raided with a
&gt; -sealed- warrant. I dont think that the contents of that 
&gt; warrant have, even today, been released (though I could 
&gt; be mistaken).  Certainly 5 years after they had not.

[....]
&gt; &gt; But there's a big difference between "seizure" and 
&gt; &gt; "forfeiture".
&gt; 
&gt; I'd argue with computer hardware it is a distinction 
&gt; without a difference. Seizing computer hardware (like 
&gt; Ripco's stuff) for in excess of 5 years is tantamount
&gt; to forfeiture given depreciation and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt; Add to this the very liberal rules about how long the 
&gt; feds can take to even CHARGE you with a crime after 
&gt; seizure....

And it sums to a very bleak picture, indeed.

[....]
&gt; &gt; So yes, there may be a statute which gives title to
&gt; &gt; the government in computers used to commit crimes, 
&gt; &gt; and no, the Supreme Court won't necessarily care 
&gt; &gt; about an "innocent owner".
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I would argue that such a statute needn't even 
&gt; exist given the rules already well estlablished and 
&gt; demonstrated in action with regard to indefinate 
&gt; seizure of computer hardware even in the absence of 
&gt; criminal claims against the owner.

Please forgive my naivete, but are there no legal
weapons available to the 'victims' in such cases?
I'm passingly familiar with the Operation Sundevil
fiasco -- i.e., with the outcome re the principal
'charges'.  I'm appalled, however, at the apparent 
lack of remedies for return of such seized property.
Are individuals who find themselves in such a 
predicament simply at the government's mercy (there's
an oxymoron for ya)??
