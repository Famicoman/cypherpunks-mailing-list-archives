&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Get a warrant, search my system, find nothing but a bunch of applications
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a collection of risque (but definitely legal) pictures which I exchange
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a few friends.  You may suspect that when the images are concatenated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a particular way the low-order bits form a stego filesystem but no one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will be able to prove it in court.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you concatenating these images by hand?  If so, the level of entropy
&gt;&gt;&gt; is probably low enough to recover the information through brute force
&gt;&gt;&gt; methods or you are hiding a very small amount of information.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hide the relatively small amount of data within a very large amount of
&gt;&gt; data which makes it impossible to find.  Data from analog sources, like
&gt;&gt; the "real world" (images, sounds, etc) is noisy.  This is a fact of life.
&gt;&gt; Because this data is noisy I can hide information in the noise.  As long
&gt;&gt; as the information I am hiding maintains the same statistical properties
&gt;&gt; of noise it is impossible to pull the information out of the data file unless
&gt;&gt; you have the key.  If I am paranoid enough I can make this key impossible
&gt;&gt; to discover without a breakthrough in factoring.
&gt;
&gt;Where will you keep your secret key?  Remember, when they go through your
&gt;house they bring 20 young graduates from MIT who are just dying to show
&gt;how clever they are and save the world at the same time.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is the essence of steganography and the nature of signal and noise are
&gt;&gt; fundemental principles of information theory.
&gt;
&gt;The concept of noise is not all that well defined, however.  There is no
&gt;way to look at a signal and say "this is all noise."  Sometimes physical
&gt;theories may lead you to believe that it is all noise.  That is fine
&gt;for many applications, but when becomes less convinced of things if
&gt;the consequences are severe.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are not doing it by hand, you own terrorist software and will pay
&gt;&gt;&gt; the price.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ah yes, terrorist programs like cat and perl and operating systems like
&gt;&gt; Linux which contain a loopback filesystem that I can hook a perl
&gt;&gt; interpreter into at compile-time (which is enough for me to rewrite the
&gt;&gt; program from scratch each time if necessary, unless things like math
&gt;&gt; libraries are also outlawed on computers :)  I think that the crypto
&gt;&gt; concentration camps are going to be very crowded places.
&gt;
&gt;Can you elaborate on this?  I am curious to know exactly what you are going
&gt;to keep in your head and what goes on the disk.  Please post the Perl
&gt;code that you would type in from scratch every time.

(Most of the message left for clarity)
I would type dungeon at the prompt and Ctrl-Alt-6 at the first door.
But that's just me.
BTW.  The hypothetical Steno program (Trojan Horse) that I wrote about
earlier (and that this refers) could have its own source hidden in the
opening screen of both the game and the bmp that I would use for my windows
background.  If anyone has access to the source of a soon to be released
game, they could add this to it as an easter egg, thus, the author would be
spreading a very powerful tool which would be advertized several months
after it was released.  If it were added to a program with references to
cypherpunks or similar, it might even reach the (primary) target audience.
