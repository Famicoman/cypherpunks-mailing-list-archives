The mere fact that a privately-owned discussion group becomes popular does
not mean that it becomes a public forum.

Say I start a poetry mailing list to discuss Blake's writings. I have
three people on it. One becomes obnoxious and emailbombs the list since he
disagrees with my interpretation of "A Memorable Fancy." Do I have the
right to kick him off? How is this different from a private poetry reading
in my home?

&gt; &gt; Cypher-Censored
&gt; &gt; By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
&gt; &gt;        The cypherpunks mailing list, so legend goes, coalesced around two
&gt; &gt;    principles: the dissemination of strong encryption and an absolute
&gt; &gt;    commitment to free speech. It was a kind of crypto-anarchist utopia:
&gt; &gt;    Here was a place where anonymity was encouraged and PGP-signed
&gt; &gt;    postings were the norm -- and nobody seemed to be in control.
&gt; &gt;        That is, until recently, when Dimitri Vulis was given the boot.
&gt; &gt;    After he refused to stop posting flames, rants and uninspired personal
&gt; &gt;    attacks, Vulis was summarily removed from the mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; [snippo]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;        Vulis portrays himself as a victim, but as I posted to the list
&gt; &gt;    last week, I disagree. Anyone who's spent any time on the
&gt; &gt;    100-plus-messages-a-day list can read for themselves the kind of nasty
&gt; &gt;    daily messages that came from Vulis's keyboard. The list is on
&gt; &gt;    Gilmore's machine and he can do what he wants with it; he can moderate
&gt; &gt;    the postings, he can censor material, he can shut the whole thing down.
&gt; 
&gt; [mo' snippo]
&gt; 
&gt; So you disagree.  Well, the last sentence above says it all - this "list"
&gt; that you and 1900+ other people spend so much time on is "just property"
&gt; (like a slave), it's censorable (meaning freedom of speech is *specifically
&gt; excluded*), and it's terminable without notice (meaning that it's really
&gt; just one person's private fantasy, and we'll all bozos on the bus, as it were).
&gt; 
&gt; You and several other "personal friends/insiders" to John Gilmore must be
&gt; laughing your butts off at the erstwhile schmoes like myself, who labor to
&gt; reason with persons like yourself and "gods" like John Gilmore, who, after
&gt; all, are obviously superior to us schmoes, since we sit and beg for our
&gt; portions of email emanating from John "God" Gilmore's Holy Computer.
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you bother telling us that:
&gt; 
&gt;   "He can moderate the postings"
&gt;   "He can censor material"
&gt;   "He can shut the whole thing down"
&gt; 
&gt; Why?  Is this your way (or "God"'s way) of waving your dicks in our faces?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I'll tell you what.  You can run your list (or kiss someone's butt
&gt; who does), you can shut the thing down, and you can take a long walk off
&gt; a short pier for all I or most anyone gives a damn, but let's call a spade
&gt; a spade.  You're a suck-up, and Gilmore is a swaggering, overbearing, tin-
&gt; plated dictator with delusions of Godhood.  Satisfied?
&gt; 
&gt;
