&gt; &gt;&gt;Well, I think there clearly _is_ a gender gap on these sorts of issues.

&gt; &gt;Technologies that matter make daily life less obnoxious, and you can
&gt; &gt;leverage them all the time. The Net is going to start mattering in a
&gt; &gt;significant way when it relieves people of the burden of dealing with
&gt; &gt;the garbage inherent in the information flow of everyday life. The net
&gt; &gt;is going to matter when I can rely on

&gt; Well, in the 23 years I've been on the Net in one way or another, I can
&gt; honestly say it is _increased_ my exposure to garbage. The notion that
&gt; computers are time-savers is fraught with problems. For some tasks, it
&gt; clearly is.
&gt; But for other tasks and situations, it's a time sink. I view it primarily
&gt; as a communications mechanism, e.g., lists like this, the Web, news, etc.
&gt; Your mileage may vary.
&gt; Notions that computers will be widely accepted because of their
&gt; "time-saving" powers I file right next to claims that computers will be
&gt; useful for storing recipes and balancing checkbooks.

Huh?  Just this year, I wrote a letter to an insurance company about
some bozo who hit my car, and thought he'd get away with it.
The computer allowed me to keep re-editing the letter until it was
perfected, which task would have been not feasible or simply would not
have been done manually, for what should be obvious reasons.
I won my case, and the other guy is suffering those nasty payments...
I even beat the CHP on that one....

Three to four years ago, I used my computer to edit my cover letters and
resumes, to perfect them, to send out to hundreds of potential employers,
which resulted in my getting the exact job I wanted (which now pays very
well), in spite of the fact that I started looking in L.A. just when the
riots commenced, at the same time that tens of thousands of "technical"
people were laid off from various defense contractors.

Of course, I used my computers to perfect certain computer skills (for
which I never went to College) which landed me a whole series of nice
jobs from 1979 through 1992, but that doesn't count, right?

I hesitate to admit this, but the bottom line is that the computer is
a tool that can give one person an advantage over another, for which
messaging and communications is just incidental.  Since we are in fact
an animal predator (as humans), I don't think you have to have a whole
lot of imagination to understand where that goes...
