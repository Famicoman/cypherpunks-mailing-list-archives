&gt;                        MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF GOD AND JESUS
&gt;
&gt;Sexual Sin and Christians
&gt;
&gt;   19940404
&gt;
&gt;   Charles Magee (Not available via Internet),
&gt;   See also:
&gt;     * Classification of Religions
&gt;     * Life After Death
&gt;
&gt;This article's surreality index is 'U' (unreal).
&gt;
&gt;To solve the question of if sex is a sin in Christianity, the following
&gt;model has been constructed.  In this model God is a point mass, centered
&gt;at the origin of our XYZ space.  Christ, we assume, is at the right hand
&gt;of God, about 100 centimeters away.  His mass is probably around 75
&gt;kilograms.
&gt;
&gt;Since God has a very large mass (a bit less than infinity), Christ, who
&gt;we assume is in a circular orbit around God, has a very large momentum,
&gt;and hence has a very small wavelength.  This means that Christ's
&gt;uncertainty is quite small, so we can therefore conclude that he is
&gt;fairly certain in all that he does.
&gt;
&gt;Now let us consider a sinner.  We shall place him at a large distance from
&gt;God, say one inch and 45 million light-years.  He, being at a constant
&gt;distance from God and thus in a circular orbit, and having approximately
&gt;the same mass as Christ, will be travelling significantly slower than
&gt;Christ, and will therefore be more uncertain.  One should also consider,
&gt;however, that since Christ's orbit could fit in a kiddie pool, while the
&gt;sinner's would encompass not only our galaxy, but a few of the nearby ones
&gt;as well, that the sinner gets around more, sees more, and is generally a
&gt;more knowledgeable guy than the Savior.  This fits in with traditional
&gt;wisdom.
&gt;
&gt;Mary, the Mother of Jesus, being a fairly pure person, is close to God.
&gt;This means that she must be a fast woman.  From this situation we can draw
&gt;the conclusion that sinners have a lot more potential than saints, since
&gt;less of their energy is stored as kinetic energy.  Further insights can be
&gt;gained when we look at the situation of the heathen.
&gt;
&gt;A heathen is someone who, in general, is not affected by God.  This means
&gt;that they are at least an infinite distance from him.  Now, assuming that
&gt;one of these folk starts, by random causes, to travel towards God, he will
&gt;convert his potential energy to kinetic energy during the approach, or
&gt;descent.  Since he started out an infinite distance away, but with some
&gt;kinetic energy of his own, he will approach God on a hyperbolic trajectory
&gt;and then disappear into space again, never to be seen again.  If his
&gt;approach is such that it brings him inside the orbit of The Son of God,
&gt;then right after his closest approach, the heathen's velocity will be
&gt;greater than Jesus', which means that he will be more sure of himself in
&gt;his escape than Christ who is in orbit.  This is an interesting notion,
&gt;but some of the side ramifications are even more intriguing.
&gt;
&gt;Without any orbiters, therefore, God would not be able to attract anyone;
&gt;all approaching bodies would have either parabolic or hyperbolic
&gt;trajectories.  However, once God has an orbiter, the two of them could
&gt;collaborate to capture other bodies.  This means that heathens that get
&gt;too close to believers in their approaches might get trapped, and by the
&gt;same token, believers who are buzzed by heathens could be ejected.
&gt;
&gt;And what, the reader asks at this point, does any of this have to do with
&gt;sex?  Well, the answer is this:  Sex, as we all know, is the union of two
&gt;or more people.  This, in our analogy, would be represented as a collision.
&gt;Now, in Christianity, almost all of the holy figures are male.  For God, a
&gt;collision between any of these close in folk would be disastrous, because,
&gt;even if we assume they are indestructible, such a high energy collision
&gt;would either:
&gt;
&gt;          A) Eject one of the men out of orbit (becoming a heathen)
&gt;          B) Cause one of them to fall into God (to die)
&gt;          C) Give them highly irregular elliptical orbits (becoming a
&gt;             doubter)
&gt;
&gt;All of these would be bad for God, because in the first two he would lose
&gt;orbiters, making His chance at capturing new ones less, and in the third
&gt;case He would have a much greater chance of more collisions, as the
&gt;elliptical orbiters would cross many of the unaffected circular orbits.
&gt;Therefore, God probably disapproves of these collisions.
