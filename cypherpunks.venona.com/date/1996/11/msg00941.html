&gt; One shouldn't be vocal to public employees in any case.  Avoid them.  If
&gt; you are going to be vocal use a non government forum.  Separate your
&gt; personal life from your political life.  It's not too hard to break most of
&gt; the pointers between your physical presence and your ideological presence.
&gt; Even though an investigator could find where I sleep at night, they would
&gt; have to actually expend the resources.  My neighbors and the local cops are
&gt; unlikely to make the connection because they and I move in very different
&gt; circles and I minimize my database presence.

Those people who live a very simple life [no TV, or at least no Cable TV,
sleep on the floor with a small, thin mattress, use very little power
outside of what's necessary for the laptop AC adapters, drive the smallest
cheapest car available, wear old clothing, wear a beard to cut down on
shaving, eat mostly veggie and mostly fresh, avoid doctors and drugstore
products, stay away from large-corporation jobs, move frequently, rent
but never buy, .... (you get the picture)] will get by just fine, and
will have the flexibility to make large-scale adjustments rather easily.

People who consider the opposite of some of the things mentioned above as
very important to them will have to deal with the bad news.
