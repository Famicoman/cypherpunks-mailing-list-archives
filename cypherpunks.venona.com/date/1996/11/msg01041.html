&gt; It's not a way of saying I don't understand. Instead, I find your
&gt; viewpoint incomprehensible and internally inconsistent.

Which, of course, means that there is nothing to understand...for you.
However, I do observe that there are meanings in things I, myself,
find both incomprehensible and inconsistent. Just because I am unable
to understand does not mean that there is no understanding to be had.
I am not that important. Are you?

&gt; In fact, you Freedom Knight folks seem to be closet censors yourself. Why
&gt; do you support not carrying newsgroups like alt.config?

I never have supported or opposed alt.config. I have said that it is
meaningless, but that was after I understood its purpose. ;-)

&gt; Yes, ownership gives you a license to censor. I'm going to have a party in
&gt; my home a few weeks from now. If I don't like what someone is doing, I'll
&gt; kick 'em out. I won't do it lightly, but I will fight for my right to do
&gt; so.

Of course, you may invite anyone you choose, since a party is usually
had by inviting people whom you select. If you invite them and then
subsequently kick them out when they do things you do not want them to
do, I will chastise -you- (if I am present) for your lack of judgement
in whom to invite. Their behavior would merely something to learn
from, yours would be fashionably dishonorable.

BTW, "Kicking them out" is not censorship. A party and a mailing list
are usually two different things. The former may include the latter,
but the latter is not anything like the former.

&gt; Oh, and I plan to subscribe to the freedom-knights mailing list and infest
&gt; it the way Vulis did cypherpunks. Every hour, on the hour, a crontab
&gt; script will flood it with rants about Dave (fart) Hayes.

You won't do this, because I won't let you on the list. I, unlike you
or Mr. Gilmore, have the judgement on whom to invite to my list.

&gt; What will you do then?

Even if you did such a thing, I have a mail filter. Your messages
would be unceremoniously discarded. 

Have you learned nothing from USENET?

Ask the American public if they want an FBI Wiretax and they'll say 'no.'  
If you ask them do they want a feature on their phone that helps the FBI find 
their missing child they'll say, 'Yes.'"
