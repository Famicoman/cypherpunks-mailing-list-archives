In this post you talk about SSN web pages?  I was wondering if someone
could post a URL to one?

thanks

&gt; &gt; &gt;I have two kids entering their teens, and I'm sure other list members
are
&gt; &gt; &gt;parents as well.  What can we do for our children to help them enter
their
&gt; &gt; &gt;adult lives with better chances to retain privacy?  Unicorn mentions
keeping
&gt; &gt; &gt;them absent from school on picture day, although I'm not sure how much
this
&gt; &gt; &gt;helps.  I suppose it makes it harder for an investigator to find out
what
&gt; &gt; &gt;they look(ed) like.  Then when they get old enough to drive you have a
new
&gt; &gt; &gt;problem avoiding the photo (and thumbprint) on the license.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Are there other measures which parents could take while their children
are
&gt; &gt; &gt;young to get them off to a good start, privacy-wise?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think there are two important domains of privacy to distinguish:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. The mundane.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2, The political.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The mundane domain is what most people think of initially, Things like
"How
&gt; &gt; do I keep my name out of the system?" Or the point about kids.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The fact is, hundreds of millions of names are obviously--and almost
&gt; &gt; unavoidably--in the mundane public sector. I say "almost unavoidably"
&gt; &gt; because driver's licenses and social security numbers are ubiquitous.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (Side note: Jim McCoy's suggestion that kids can be kept off the
&gt; &gt; parental-unit's tax returns and thus not get a SS number is fraught
with
&gt; &gt; problems. Many schools--including public schools--use the SS number for
&gt; &gt; various internal and tracking reasons. Even if the kid is free of SS
&gt; &gt; numbers until he's a teenager--at a cost of thousands of dollars a year
in
&gt; &gt; IRS deductions not taken--he'll essentially have to have an SS number
in
&gt; &gt; his high school years, for a variety of reasons. Maybe this can be
avoided,
&gt; &gt; but I doubt the reward is worth the hassles.)
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I suggest that the dependent be identified with an erronious
&gt; SSN number.  If the dependent exists it is hard to make a fraud case and
&gt; the deductions are usually allowed anyhow.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what "a variety of reasons" in the highschool years is.  As
&gt; for hastles, I can't think of what they might be, other than going to the
&gt; SSN web page to construct a properly formatted number which the SSA will
&gt; report as "Issued" (as opposed to "Unissued").  This is one of the few
&gt; pieces of information that is given out.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, DMVs cannot check to see that the number matches the name, only if
&gt; it was issued and if the first three digits correspond to location where
&gt; the number was supposedly "issued" from.  (If not one can always claim to
&gt; have lived in the state that DID issue that number).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The second category is that of the political domain. If a person can
&gt; &gt; separate himself from the comments he makes, as Alois^H^H^H^H^H Black
&gt; &gt; Unicorn has done, then it hardly matters--in an important sense--that
his
&gt; &gt; True Name has a SS number on file somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree.
&gt; The lack of a social security number makes the first part easier.  They
&gt; are most certainly connected in the research into the few clues that will
&gt; have to slip out, will not lead back to any fact which can be later used
&gt; to narrow down the field.  (The first three numbers of a SSN for
example).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is an important distinction in discussing privacy, I think. If I
had a
&gt; &gt; rug rat, I doubt I'd go to great lengths to avoid getting him or her an
SS
&gt; &gt; number. If the Feds offered me a yearly savings of $1000 or more on my
&gt; &gt; taxes, I'd take it.
&gt; 
&gt; Pity, but still, you can avoid it without sacrificing the dependent
&gt; deduction.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (Given that it's almost an inevitability that the kid would have to
"enter
&gt; &gt; the system" at about the age where it really begins to matter, e.g, the
age
&gt; &gt; at which he or she begins to have political beliefs.)
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand why this is so.  Perhaps I missed a link in the chain
&gt; here?
