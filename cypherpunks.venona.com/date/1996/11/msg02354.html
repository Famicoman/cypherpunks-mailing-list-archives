SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES

ONLINE RIVALS GATES AND CASE CIRCLE EACH OTHER
The online world has become a killing field. CompuServe pulls the plug on
its consumer-based Wow service; Prodigy, at the bottom of the heap,
transmogrifies Kafka-like into an ISP. Now, as the mighty Web threatens to
consume all in its path, these two cyberbehemoths engage in a struggle for
the whole enchilada.

ATTENTION COMDEX SURVIVORS! NEED SOMEONE TO FEEL YUR PAYNNNE?
Okay, you've been through a lot, granted...but speaking out about your
Comdex trials and tribulations can help the all-important healing process
begin. So please, send us your war stories. We will publish the five best,
and the winners--picked on a totally subjective basis by our editorial
staff-- will get supercool CNET T-shirts. Send your tales to
suggestions@news.com, and include the words 'Comdex stories' in the subject
of your message. P.S. Don't forget to check out our comprehensive coverage
of the sublime and the ridiculous at Comdex '96.

AOL'S PRIX FIXE OFFER MIGHT CAUSE ANOTHER SERVICE DELAY
Just when you AOLers thought it was safe to go back online, the possibility
of another service glitch rises up on the cyberhorizon. Starting on December
1, AOL's 7 million users have the option of switching to an all-you-can-eat
pricing offer; the resultant "usage surge" may cause service delays,
according to a recent AOL announcement. Wise users might consider getting
their heavy surfing done this long weekend, once that turkey-induced coma
sets in.

INTEL'S MULTIMEDIA CHIP: MORE SUITABLE FOR FUN AND GAMES THAN BUSINESS
Intel's latest technological achievement, the MMX Pentium processor, would
certainly be ideal for running sophisticated business applications--that is,
if there WERE sophisticated business applications for it to run. At this
point, MMX seems more useful in entertainment and gaming settings than in
the executive suite. The $64,000 question: will developers build for this
flashy new kid on the block?
