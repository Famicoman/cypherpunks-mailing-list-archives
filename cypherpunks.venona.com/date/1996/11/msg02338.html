&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No?  Please prove your assertion.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;You can't prove a negative.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If it can't be proven, why do you believe it is true?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The good news is that you can prove a negative.  For example, it has
&gt; &gt; been proven that there is no algorithm which can tell in all cases
&gt; &gt; whether an algorithm will stop.
&gt; 
&gt; No, he was right.  They can't prove that their system is unbreakable.
&gt; They _might_ be able to prove that their system hasn't been broken, and
&gt; they _might_ be able to prove that it is _unlikely_ that it will be, but
&gt; they *CAN NOT* prove that it is unbreakable.  This is the nature of
&gt; cryptosystems.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;The best IPG could say is that
&gt; &gt; &gt;it can't be broken with current technology.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Next week someone might come up with a new way
&gt; &gt; &gt;to break ciphers that renders the IPG algorithim breakable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The best they can say is what they did say: they have a proof that
&gt; &gt; their system is unbreakable.  What you question, quite reasonably,
&gt; &gt; is whether they have such a proof.
&gt; 
&gt; It is impossible to prove such a thing.  It's like saying you have proof
&gt; that you have the last car of a certain model ever to be built.  Anybody
&gt; could come along and build another, and then you don't have the last one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;You point could have been that the same problem exists
&gt; &gt; &gt;for proofs- that next week someone could come up
&gt; &gt; &gt;with a way to prove, for all time, that an algorithim
&gt; &gt; &gt;really IS unbreakable.  So, to cover that posibility
&gt; &gt; &gt;I should have said "it's currently impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt;prove an algorithim unbreakable". :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Or, more accurately, nobody credible has seen such a proof.  But, a
&gt; &gt; clever person might invent one.
&gt; 
&gt; There *IS NO SUCH PROOF*.  Just like you can't prove that god created the
&gt; universe, or that Oswald shot Kennedy, and so on and so forth.  It can't
&gt; be proven.  It never has been proven, and it never will be proven.  People
&gt; have new ideas, new algorithms are invented.  Someday, somebody will crack
&gt; _all_ the cryptosystems that have now been invented.
&gt; 

To repeat Frantz', I thought Shannon proved OTPs were unbreakable. I can
also assure you that they are unbreakable, because you cannot solve a
three variable equation where only one variable is known, ie. the
ciphertext. That is a fact, not an opinion like God, or Oswald, there are
facts and opinions. It is a fact that OTPs are unbreakable and it is a
fact that our system is unbreakable. Q.E.D. for the very same reasons
except that we must use exclusionary proof instead of inclusionary proof
like Shannon. 

With Kindest Regards,

Don Wood
