&gt; &gt; &gt; So, you send all of your snail mail on post cards do you? No
&gt; &gt; &gt; sealed envelopes at all? Afterall you have nothing to hide, right?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Irrelevant analogy; snail.mail and e-mail.  The former is in physical
&gt; &gt; form, and the latter usually never is.
&gt; 
&gt; No kidding, thanks for that information. Perhaps you can explain how it
&gt; is relevant?
&gt; 

it is not -- I said irrelevant.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course not, privacy isn't about being a criminal, its about being
&gt; &gt; &gt; private. It is not akin to anonymity, *perhaps* those who work
&gt; &gt; &gt; anonymously have `something to hide' (still doesn't necessarily make
&gt; &gt; &gt; them a criminal, however), 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anonymity on the InterNet is a Constitutional right, and is the
&gt; &gt; sole supporter of freedom of speech.
&gt; 
&gt; Another irrelevant and completely inaccurate point. I utilize free
&gt; speech everyday yet I manage to do it without anonymity. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 

so? that is you. but if a motherfucker wants to be anonymous, he
must be allowed; there is no exception to the rule.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll let someone else field that as I feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; that anonymity is rarely a good thing. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I disagree, anonymity is a good thing that will never
&gt; &gt; be questioned by anybody, but your PGP will, and it
&gt; &gt; is really not safe anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; ha ha ha, not by anybody huh. What world do you live in? I know plenty
&gt; of people who feel that if you must say something anonymously `you must
&gt; be hiding something, probably a criminal!'. I don't subscribe to this, I
&gt; feel that most people who post anonymously are just chicken-shits, but
&gt; that too is besides the point. It *is* questioned by many people.
&gt; 

fuck them.

&gt;  And as to PGP not being safe, perhaps you could expand a bit on this,
&gt; it hasn't hurt me or anyone I know, seems pretty safe to me. To address
&gt; what I assume your point was, it acts as a prefectly good sealed
&gt; envelope (and I believe quite a bit more), in the context of my original
&gt; reply, this is quite `safe'.
&gt; 

never ever rely on something being encoded and not able to be
unencoded, that is not possible.  whatever man can do, man can
undue, and that is a law of nature that has no exception.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Privacy, on the other hand, simply means that not everything I do is any
&gt; &gt; &gt; of your business and I would just as soon you not be tempted to even
&gt; &gt; &gt; bother trying to find out. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you do not send it to me by e-mail, I will never see it.
&gt; 
&gt; Nor will you see my post-card that I send to my mom, how does that
&gt; change the nature of a post-card OR email?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why are you so paranoid that someone is reading your e-mail?
&gt; 
&gt; Paranoid? No, but why make it easy for anyone to do so? 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I never do anything criminal, so I could give a shit less if
&gt; &gt; everybody reads all of my fucking mail.
&gt; 
&gt; so how is it different, besides being electronic, from snail mail? I
&gt; repeat, why don't you use post-cards exclusively for mail? Oh yes, that
&gt; is `print', a totally different thing, geesh.
&gt; 

no, you just need envelopes for multiple pages.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, if all of your personal mail (including financial statements
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc) is sent on post cards, then (while I think you would be crazy) I
&gt; &gt; &gt; will at least admit you are consistent. Else, I think you need to look
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard at the logic you are using.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Again, inconsistant analogy.  This is nothing but photons in it's
&gt; &gt; ultimate form, and it will never see paper.  Anything that _you_
&gt; &gt; print is not attributable to me, and any e-mail printed by you
&gt; &gt; would never be acceptable as a court exhibit.
&gt; 
&gt; You appear to be confused, I look at what I wrote and I see nothing at
&gt; all that mentions courts. I am talking about personal privacy and the
&gt; analogy is not at all inconsistent. (and paper mail is nothing but atoms
&gt; in it's ultimate form, so what?)
&gt; &gt; 

You have it. Just never print anything.

&gt; &gt; stop getting cyberspace mixed up with print.
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you think there is something magical about `cyberspace'? Privacy
&gt; is privacy, period. Communication is communication, period. There is no
&gt; reason to differentiate private communication via print and private
&gt; communication via cyberspace. Both are desirable for exactly the same
&gt; reasons. 
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt; &gt; why do you put that cypherpunks address in the header?
&gt; &gt; just where did this e-mail originate from?
&gt; 
&gt; Thats how it landed on my plate, thats where I send it back, seems
&gt; reasonable to me.
&gt;  

Yeah, but some motherfucker is sending this shit to that list
I think.  What a fucking joke that is.

&gt; cheers, kinch
&gt; 
&gt; 
 cheers,
