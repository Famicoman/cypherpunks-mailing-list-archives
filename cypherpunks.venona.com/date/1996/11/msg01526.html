I was poking about on the hp web server, trying to get some more hints
about the technology they are pushing:

&lt;URL: <A  HREF="http://www-dmo.external.hp.com/gsy/press/sevcik.html">http://www-dmo.external.hp.com/gsy/press/sevcik.html</A>&gt;

&gt; Date: 7/11/96
&gt; 
&gt; Rich Sevcik, vice president and general manager of the Systems
&gt; Technology Group, testified to a U.S. Senate subcommittee June 12 on
&gt; the importance of cryptography to Hewlett-Packard's ability to compete
&gt; in the international marketplace and to the nation's high-technology
&gt; competitiveness.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; In conclusion, he introduced HP's technology called the International
&gt; Cryptography Framework (ICF). Products based on ICF would contain a
&gt; suite of cryptography capabilities of various strengths and types,
&gt; all non-functional. A customer then could enable the desired types and
&gt; strengths of cryptography in conformance with export and host government
&gt; regulations by obtaining a stamp-size smart card (known as a "policy
&gt; card"), programmed to turn on the particular cryptography capability
&gt; allowed. This would protect the right of each nation to establish an
&gt; independent policy governing cryptography in digital communication and
&gt; storage. Sevcik showed the subcommittee members a prototype cryptography
&gt; unit and several policy cards. He said HP plans to have an initial
&gt; ICF product available later this year as part of a total smart card
&gt; system solution offered due to an alliance with Informix and GEMPLUS,
&gt; with other ICF-based products planned for next year.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. export license authorities are finishing their review of this
&gt; first-phase implementation of ICF. "We have been extremely pleased with
&gt; the responsiveness and cooperation of these agencies in the review of
&gt; our technology," Sevcik said. "We have every reason to believe that
&gt; the cryptographic unit and host systems will be granted liberal export
&gt; authorization consistent with our expectations for ICF."

&gt; Press Release
&gt; 
&gt; HP Announces Alliance with Gemplus and Informix to Deliver Personal
&gt; Information Cards for Consumers
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. Government Reviewing Industry-backed HP International Cryptography
&gt; Framework
&gt; 
&gt; September 26, 1995
&gt; 
&gt; PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 26, 1995 -- Hewlett-Packard Company, Gemplus
&gt; and Informix today announced the formation of an alliance to develop a
&gt; secure infrastructure that will enable corporations to speed new services
&gt; to consumers via a credit-card-sized personal information card.
&gt; 
&gt; These cards will carry several thousand times the amount of data carried
&gt; by currently available smart cards. Additionally, the data on these cards
&gt; will be fully encrypted for secure international communication, so the
&gt; card will be able to be used anywhere in the world. HP believes that
&gt; the U.S. government will authorize the export to commercial enterprises
&gt; of products in Phase I(1) of HP's international cryptography framework
&gt; standard -- one of the underlying technologies in the infrastructure
&gt; that will enable the international use of personal information cards. The
&gt; framework is based on HP's open cryptographic structure.
