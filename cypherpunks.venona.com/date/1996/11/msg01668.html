&gt; &gt;       Well, I was thinking, what if a "Crypto Software Bounty Server"
&gt; &gt;  were set up, so that someone could propose a tool that they would like
&gt; &gt;  to see, along with an initial bounty. Others could contribute toward that
&gt; &gt;  bounty (anonymously if they wish) until either the tool was delivered.
&gt; &gt;       The original issuer sets standards for the software (i.e. "easy to
&gt; &gt;  use interface to mixmaster remailers for Macintosh", then must define
&gt; &gt;  easy to use; Software considered delivered when in [alpha beta late-beta
&gt; &gt;  &amp;etc.]). The first to present software meeting these qualifications gets
&gt; &gt;  the bounty, with the caviate that the software must be either gnu-copylefted,
&gt; &gt;  or some similar "free use" copyright, after all, "The Net" paid for it...
&gt; Hmmm.  This is a one shot game (is that the term?) whereas software

     Correct term, but not necessarily accurate. 

&gt; generally has implications that escape a single sale scenario.  For
&gt; example, the more difficult the software, the more risk there is that
&gt; someone else will beat you, thus lowering the real risk-adjusted payoff
&gt; dramatically.   For this reason, more complex stuff would need some sort
&gt; of contract+reputation scenario that allows a repeating game to work.

     Not necessarily. It could be set up to keep the Bounty open, to provide
a revenue stream for upgrades, or second, third &amp; etc. bounties for upgrades
bug fixes and new features. 

&gt; A contractual alternative could work like this.  I (the initial desirer)
&gt; write a contract specifying my requirements.  I publish this as a market
&gt; tender, where other desirers can contribute funds, and this becomes a

     &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; eliminates the need for judges.  History shows that a good market
&gt; microstructure will beat an authority approach in the long run.

     Reputation could also eleminate the need for judges. If Matt Blaze, 
or Randall S. were to try to claim a specific bounty, people would be 
more likely to accept their claim than if I were to do so. 

&gt; Also note that if you drop the free software assumption, and make it,
&gt; say, moneyware, then the market becomes much more workable - the asset
&gt; being traded is a share of future revenues.  This has more ramifications
&gt; than might be obvious:  Propose a market to write a GAK killer for
&gt; e$10,000.  If it clears and is built, is the Dept. of Justice forced to
&gt; buy the rights out?

    If it is GNU'd, then there is no one to buy out. I like the idea of 
"free" software. As it stands now, there is a lot of very high quality 
software free software out there (hell, all of the software I use _daily_
is "free" software), and if no one owns it, the government can't use 
copyright laws to restrict it. The feds _can't_ buy it out for a million 
dollars. 

     The other thing about the "bounty server" is that it is simpler to
set up (at least as far as I can see) than your contract model. 

     All you would need is to settle up the details, set up a web server
with the ability to handle ecash, and some sort of accounting and you are
off. Maybe, just to prove you are legit, a performance bond.
