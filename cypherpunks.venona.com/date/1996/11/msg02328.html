        read the last line. the usual rules of evidence which give
    the feds the right to anything they well please --constitutional
    or not!  if seizure of a victims property can by obtained a 
    search and sieze warrant for the victimized "object,"  a whole
    new mode of regulation has begun.

        all the government will do to suppress sites as they please,
    is to initiate a few attacks themselves --and they will.

        I got tired of paying Lexus $150 for idle months after dumping
    West for almost $500/month --otherwise I would run down the Feds
    kangaroo ruling which seems to grant them this absurd right. 
    Several on the list are still maintaining accounts...  ?

Computer Attacks Show New Patterns

The major trends in computer break-ins involve denial of service 
and data-driven attacks, says a Department of Justice lawyer.  
Denial of service occurs when an attacker "bombs" an Internet 
service provider with so many e-mail messages that the server 
becomes overloaded and shuts down. Data-driven attacks occur when 
a virus program is disguised as a data-only file.  The file can be 
hidden in a Java program on a Web page, and when a visitor clicks 
on the site, he or she unwittingly downloads the virus.  A computer 
crime consultant with SAIC warns that these attacks can be launched 
on an innocent party's Web server, but once that happens, the server 
can become the subject of a wiretap and a search warrant.  "The title 
of your computer vests with the government as soon as a hacker uses 
it to commit a crime," he says.
