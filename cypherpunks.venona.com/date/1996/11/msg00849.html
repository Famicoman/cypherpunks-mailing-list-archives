&gt; Chemical Warfare Agents
&gt; An overview of chemicals defined as chemical weapons
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Main Groups
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Nerve Agents
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Mustard Agents
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Hydrogen Cyanide
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Tear Gases
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Arsines
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Psychotomimetic Agents
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Toxins
&gt; &gt;&gt;     Potential CW Agents
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; What is a Chemical Warfare Agent?
&gt;
&gt; A United Nations report from 1969 defines chemical warfare agents as " ...
&gt; chemical substances, whether gaseous, liquid or solid, which might be
&gt; employed because of their direct toxic effects on man, animals and plants
&gt; ... ".
&gt; The Chemical Weapons Convention defines chemical weapons as including not
&gt; only toxic chemicals but also ammunition and equipment for their
&gt; dispersal.  Toxic chemicals are stated to be " ... any chemical which,
&gt; through its
&gt; chemical effect on living processes, may cause death, temporary loss of
&gt; performance, or permanent injury to people and animals". Plants are not
&gt; mentioned in this context.
&gt;
&gt; Toxins, i.e., poisons produced by living organisms and their synthetic
&gt; equivalents, are classed as chemical warfare agents if they are used for
&gt; military purposes. However, they have a special position since they are
&gt; covered by the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972. This
&gt; convention bans the development,production and stockpiling of such
&gt; substances not required for peaceful purposes.
&gt;
&gt; Today, thousands of poisonous substances are known but only a few are
&gt; considered suitable for chemical warfare. About 70 different chemicals
&gt; have been used or stockpiled as CW agents during the 20th century. Today, only
&gt; a few of these are considered of interest owing to a number of demands that
&gt; must be placed on a substance if it is to be of use as a CW agent.
&gt;
&gt; A presumptive agent must not only be highly toxic but also "suitably
&gt; highly toxic" so that it is not too difficult to handle. The substance
&gt; must be capable of being stored for long periods in containers without
&gt; degradation and without corroding the packaging material. It must be
&gt; relatively resistant to atmospheric water and oxygen so that it does not
&gt; lose effect when dispersed. It must also withstand the heat developed when
&gt; dispersed.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; "War Gases" are Seldom Gases
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; CW agents are frequently called war gases and a war where CW agents are
&gt; used is usually called a gas war. These incorrect terms are a result of
&gt; history. During the First World War use was made of chlorine and phosgene
&gt; which are gases at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure. The
&gt; CWagents used today are only exceptionally gases. Normally they are liquids
&gt; or solids. However, a certain amount of the substance is always in
&gt; volatile form (the amount depending on how rapidly the substance evaporates)
&gt; and the gas concentration may become poisonous. Both solid substances and
&gt; liquids can also be dispersed in the air in atomized form, so-called
&gt; aerosols. An aerosol can penetrate the body through the respiratory organs
&gt; in the same way as a gas. Some CW agents can also penetrate the skin. This
&gt; mainly concerns liquids but in some cases also gases and aerosols. Solid
&gt; substances penetrate the skin slowly unless
&gt; they happen to be mixed with a suitable solvent.
&gt;
&gt; Effects on Vegetation
&gt;
&gt; Flowers and leaves of some plants may change colour if they are exposed to
&gt; droplets of a CW agent in an attack. Light or matt spots may occur as well
&gt; as brown discoloration, particularly on leaves. Entire trees, or parts of
&gt; them, may also get brown discoloration in situations of strong exposure.
&gt; The discoloration often arises within a few minutes but may also occur
&gt; after some days.
&gt;
&gt; Classification
&gt;
&gt; CW agents can be classified in many different ways. There are, for
&gt; example, volatile substances, which mainly contaminate the air, or persistent
&gt; substances, which are involatile and therefore mainly cover surfaces.
&gt; CW agents mainly used against people may also be divided into lethal and
&gt; incapacitating cathegories. A substance is classified as incapacitating if
&gt; less than 1/100 of the lethal dose causes incapacitation, e.g., through
&gt; nausea or visual problems. The limit between lethal and incapacitating
&gt; substances is not absolute but refers to a statistical average. In
&gt; comparison, it may be mentioned that the ratio for the nerve agents
&gt; between the incapacitating and lethal dose is approximately 1/10. Chemical
&gt; warfare agents are generally also classified according to their effect on the
&gt; organism.
&gt;
&gt; In order to achieve good ground coverage when dispersed from a high
&gt; altitude with persistent CW agents the dispersed droplets must be
&gt; sufficiently large to ensure that they fall within the target area and do
&gt; not get transported elsewhere by the wind. This can be achieved by
&gt; dissolving polymers (e.g., polystyrene or rubber products) in the CW agent
&gt; to make the product highly-viscous or thickened. The result will be that
&gt; the persistence time and adhesive ability increase which thus complicates
&gt; decontamination.
&gt;
&gt; Although it may appear that a CW agent can be "custom-made" for a certain
&gt; purpose, this is not the case. Instead, there is always some uncertainty
&gt; about the persistence time, the dispersal and the effect.
&gt;
&gt; These Military Chemicals are Not Considered to be Chemical Weapons
&gt;
&gt; Incendiary agents such as napalm and phosphorus are not considered to be
&gt; CW agents since they achieve their effect mainly through thermal energy.
&gt; Certain types of smoke screen may be poisonous in extremely high
&gt; concentrations but, nonetheless, smoke ammunition is not classed as a
&gt; chemical weapon since the poisonous effect is not the reason for their
&gt; use. Plants, microorganisms, algae, etc. which produce toxins are not classed
&gt; as chemical weapons even if the produced toxins belong to that class.
&gt; Pathogenic microorganisms, mainly viruses and bacteria, are classed as
&gt; biological weapons.

&gt; From:   "Wilson, Gary, COL, OSD/RA" &lt;GWilson@osd.pentagon.mil&gt;
&gt; Subject:  Iraq: WMD
&gt; Date:      Fri, 1 Nov 1996 08:24:37 -0500
&gt;
&gt;    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before and during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, truck
&gt; convoys carried Iraqi chemical and biological weapons, as well as nuclear
&gt; material to safe haven in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence documents.
&gt; &gt;   "The trucks were camouflaged with mud during their travel through Iraqi
&gt; &gt;territory," said the report placed Thursday on the Internet. "The convoy moved
&gt; &gt;only at night. The mud was washed off after re-entry into Iranian territory."
&gt; &gt;   The report said "at least 14 trucks were identified as having nuclear,
&gt; &gt;biological and chemical cargo. Boxes labeled 'tularemia,' 'anthrax,'
&gt; 'botulinum' and 'plague' were loaded into containers."
&gt; &gt;   The trucks were driven by Iranian civilians who turned them over to Iranian
&gt; &gt;Revolutionary Guards.
&gt; &gt;   That account was among more than 200 documents placed on the Internet over
&gt; &gt;the objections of the CIA. They were put on the worldwide computer network by
&gt; &gt;publisher Bruce W. Kletz, who plans to put out a book by a former CIA analyst,
&gt; &gt;Patrick Eddington.
&gt; &gt;   Eddington asserts that the agency has hidden evidence that American troops
&gt; &gt;were exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons.
&gt; &gt;   "These documents are still under review," CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said.
&gt; &gt;"We consider portions of them to be classified."
&gt; &gt;   The Pentagon originally put the material on the Internet and then
&gt; withdrew it in February when the CIA objected to making it public.
&gt; &gt;   While numerous studies have found no conclusive evidence that Iraqi forces
&gt; &gt;used chemical or biological weapons against U.S. troops during the 1991 war, it
&gt; &gt;is feared U.S. forces could have been exposed to nerve gas as they destroyed an
&gt; &gt;Iraqi munitions dump after the war's end.
&gt; &gt;   Iraq's transfer of material to Iran was a new example of cooperation between
&gt; &gt;two countries that fought an eight-year war but became covert allies when a
&gt; &gt;U.S.-led coalition demanded that Iraq withdraw forces that occupied Kuwait in
&gt; &gt;August 1990.
&gt; &gt;   During the ensuing Persian Gulf War, Iran allowed Iraqi planes to land
&gt; on its territory to escape destruction by coalition forces. The planes were not
&gt; allowed to rejoin the Iraqi military during the conflict.
&gt; &gt;   The documents did not shed new light on whether U.S. forces came into
&gt; contact with Iraqi chemical weapons. But they did show the concern about Iraq's ability to manufacture and deploy such weapons.
&gt; &gt;   One document cited a defector's account that "at least one chemical company
&gt; &gt;is attached to each (Iraqi) division."
&gt; &gt;   Russia may have supplied biological warfare technology to Iraq and North
&gt; &gt;Korea, according to a report written in 1994. "It was believed that the
&gt; &gt;technology transfer commenced several years prior to April 1992 and was
&gt; still in progress during April 1992," the report said.
&gt; &gt;   The material also indicated the government had evidence that Iraq had moved
&gt; &gt;chemical weapons into Kuwait.
&gt; &gt;   One report in January 1991, from an Iraqi national, said that chemical land
&gt; &gt;mines had been loaded for shipment to Kuwait. The report said the information
&gt; &gt;"cannot be confirmed."
&gt; &gt;   In September 1990, less than two months after Iraq occupied Kuwait, evidence
&gt; &gt;was seen that "Iraqi forces may be conducting chemical decontamination
&gt; &gt;exercises. They could be preparing for a chemical attack."
&gt; &gt;   During the same period, when the United States and its allies were massing
&gt; &gt;forces in the Persian Gulf region, U.S. officials were concerned that
&gt; terrorists
&gt; &gt;allied with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would stage attacks on allied
&gt; forces.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   Among the records returned to the Internet is a Nov. 3, 1995, memo
&gt; written by Paul Wallner, a Pentagon official heading an oversight panel dealing with Gulf War veterans' illnesses.
&gt; &gt;   Noting that various military officials and departments had "expressed
&gt; concern about potential sensitive reports or documents on GulflINK," the Persian Gulf War web site, Wallner recommended certain steps to "allow the investigation
&gt; team time to begin preparation of a response on particular 'bombshell' reports."
&gt; &gt;   According to the memo, a host of material would be subject to further
&gt; review, including "documents containing releasable information which could
&gt; embarrass the government or DoD," the Department of Defense.
&gt; &gt;   It also warned that additional scrutiny would be needed on documents "that
&gt; &gt;could generate unusual public/media attention" or those "which seem to confirm
&gt; &gt;the use or detection of nuclear, chemical or biological agents."

&gt;
&gt; I think we have an excellent example of the psychological impact of
&gt; chemical weapons in the case of Israel right now.  The news statements
&gt; about land for peace in the Golan came shortly after new gas masks were
&gt; issued in Israel and I got curious.  I went back and checked the news
&gt; database and found that speeches recomending not serving in the IDF, that
&gt; students should leave Israel, and a wide variety of other self defeating
&gt; actions peaked at about one week after news of chemical weapons threats,
&gt; issueing of gas masks, and other news of this type appeared in the papers
&gt; there.  This comes after a long period of stress and being on high alert.
&gt; Early reactions seem to be panic, after a period of such stress it seems
&gt; make people (at least in this situation) turn in on themselves, willing to
&gt; abandon strongly held beliefs, etc. without knowingly tieing it to the
&gt; threats.  The attacks seemed aimed not at the threats but at the government
&gt; of Israel; yet, they are tied time-wise to increased pressure.  This was
&gt; traced over a two year period which gives some validity rather than a
&gt; one-time relationship.
&gt;
&gt; I hate to say it, but this is an excellent laboratory for a variety of such
&gt; studies as it isn't artificial and its one of the few places where open
&gt; information is available on on-going threats of various types.
&gt; Sociologists have already done studies on behavior in society and such
&gt; using this lab.

&gt;
&gt; ENN Special Report
&gt; 11/08/96 - 13:45CST
&gt;
&gt; Original Allegations of Friendly Fire Came From Alleged Iranian
&gt; Propagandist
&gt;
&gt; (ENN) In light of yesterday's statements by former JFK Press Secretary
&gt; Pierre Sallinger, the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute conducted
&gt; an internal literature review of documents regarding the TWA Flight 800
&gt; disaster.  This internal probe included e-mail, newsgroup postings,press=
&gt;  reports, and consultations with experts, received from numerous sources. =
&gt;  It revealed that the original allegations of a U.S. Naval "friendly fire=
&gt;  incident" came from an alleged Iranian/Extremist Moslem propagandist named=
&gt;  Parveez Syad, aka Parveez Hussein, who was operating from a base in=
&gt;  Birmingham, England at the time.  Interestingly, Mr.Hussein/Syad=
&gt;  distributed these allegations widely on the Internet within 48 hours of the=
&gt;  incident and made what appeared to be premature accusations that the United=
&gt;  States was already engaged in a "cover-up."
&gt;
&gt; Mr. Hussein/Syad's current whereabouts are unknown, and it is believed
&gt; that he may have been the subject of a government investigation in
&gt; England. Concerns were raised, at the time, by ERRI analysts that Mr.
&gt; Syad/Hussein may have been engaged in an "disinformation" campaign in an=
&gt;  effort to deflect attention from possible moslem extremist involvement
&gt; in the bombing of Flt. 800. Subsequent inquiries and examinations by
&gt; ERRI seem to verify that there was a concerted "foreign" effort to obscure=
&gt;  and confuse a number of issues involved in the Flt. 800 investigation.
&gt;
&gt; Speculation continues among experts in regard to the authenticity of the
&gt; alleged U.S. government documents that are reportedly in the possession
&gt; of Mr. Sallinger. Without examination of these documents, ERRI analysts
&gt; say that further confirmation of Mr. Sallinger's statement is difficult
&gt; at best. One purposefully unidentified consultant told ENN that it is
&gt; even possible that Mr. Sallinger and French intelligence agents may have
&gt; been "duped" by a "foreign effort."
&gt;
&gt; U.S. Navy and FBI officials have both "catagorically denied" any viable
&gt; evidence of a "friendly fire" incident or of any sort of "cover-up" on
&gt; the part of the U.S. government. James Kallstrom announced today that he
&gt; would welcome any additional information or evidence that Mr. Sallinger
&gt; or others might have in regard to the Flight #800 tragedy.

&gt;
&gt; Many of you may be dealing with questions regarding the two matters, so
&gt; I thought I would make this available to you.

&gt; ---
&gt; Two recent events in the media are prompting my writing a very brief=
&gt;  commentary:
&gt; allegations of a cover-up in the TWA Flight 800 disaster and the alleged=20
&gt; CIA-Cocaine connection into the L.A. urban environment. My comments will be=
&gt;  directed at the propaganda value of these media events, as I'm currently=
&gt;  engaged in writing a primer on propaganda, and these make interesting case=
&gt;  studies.
&gt;
&gt; Modern propaganda comes in many forms, but of primary concern in these two=
&gt;  cases are:
&gt; - 'Mobile truth,' or the reinterpretation of events (revisionist history), a=
&gt; =20
&gt; common feature on the Internet, which is increasingly becoming an entry=
&gt;  point into the more conventional media;
&gt; - Psyops in support of operations, including spin control, after action=
&gt;  reports,or informative accounts when the media is controlled by=
&gt;  intelligence and law enforcement;
&gt; - The digital nature of media--text, photographs, video, audio--has=
&gt;  undermined the ability to establish the reality of what they represent as=
&gt;  observational proxies. This has recently been termed the 'fictive=
&gt;  environment' by the military, and I'll use the term for lack a better one.
&gt;
&gt; Let me discuss the two cases in terms of these points:
&gt;
&gt; TWA 800
&gt; Ever since Flt. 800 went down, the conspiracy theorists have been out on the=
&gt;  Internet, alleging everything from a Syrian missile to a 'friendly fire'=20
&gt; accident. Part of these allegations have been blind assertions, but some=
&gt;  have=20
&gt; been backed up with 'proof' that entails supposed photographs and internal=
&gt; =20
&gt; government documents.
&gt;
&gt; Mobile truth: in the absence of public facts or knowledge, speculation has=
&gt;  run wild. As usual, everyone's favorite pet suspect emerges--terrorists,=
&gt;  the U.S. Navy, government cover-ups, etc. This 'playing to the audience'=
&gt;  has received wide audience and coverage, because it is media hot--it=
&gt;  attracts a lot attention simply because it receives attention in the=
&gt;  viewers, readers, etc. in a self-fulfilling way. It plays on public and=
&gt;  hidden fears; provides simple=20
&gt; solutions; gives an enemy to hate, react against; it justifies the beliefs=
&gt;  and=20
&gt; agenda of many. The only solution is to provide facts, hopefully answers; of=
&gt; =20
&gt; course, this is antithetical to the investigatory (scientific and criminal)=
&gt; =20
&gt; process. This vacuum of data is being capitalized on by individuals or=20
&gt; organizations who know that the official channels are going to be closed to=
&gt;  the public--their motive is something I have no desire to quantify.
&gt;
&gt; PsyOps: this game is lose-lose for everyone; the public is confused and=
&gt;  angered, the investigation is hampered or discredited, the sources of the=
&gt;  false information will eventually be shown to be wrong (although they will=
&gt;  launch secondary operations to manage this as well, alleging further=
&gt;  cover-up, conspiracy, and so forth). What happens though is a continual=
&gt;  lessening of the resistance in the information environment to future psyops=
&gt;  operations, and this is the long term benefit sought by the perpetrators.=
&gt;  Confidence in the government is at an all time low--post Viet Nam,=
&gt;  Watergate, Iran-Contra, Whitewater, etc. The readiness to believe the worst=
&gt;  becomes greater and greater, and public mental health suffers.
&gt;
&gt; Fictive environment: while ground truth comes from direct observation, we're=
&gt;  becoming more dependent upon observational proxies than ever=
&gt;  before--photos, audio, video, documents, etc. The memories of observers is=
&gt;  a questionable thing at best (the madness of crowds), but digital trickery=
&gt;  are removing the trust values that we, only a few years ago, were able to=
&gt;  place in 'more reliable' materials. In the case of TWA, just as in most any=
&gt;  case, the creation or faking of evidence requires only modest skills and a=
&gt;  personal computer. Photos can be digital from their origin, and once=
&gt;  transferred into a computer with the right software, they can be merged or=
&gt;  altered in ways that are=20difficult to refute, even when false. Documents=
&gt;  are trivial to manufacture; elements used for provenance, showing a truth=
&gt;  and history of origin, can be falsified in a variety of ways (optically=
&gt;  scanning letterhead or signature, creation from scratch by matching=
&gt;  typeset, etc.), and the textual body can be anything imagined (and textual=
&gt;  analysis or comparison is commonly beyond the capabilities of the=
&gt;  audience). Video and audio are slightly more complex (in levels of effort);=
&gt;  video modification, loosely based on the same technology used to alter=
&gt;  photographs, requires greater skill and more powerful equipment, but is=
&gt;  gradually coming into the range of the average consumer, just as audio=
&gt;  sampling and modification technology has reached the 'garage' level. All=
&gt;  this calls into question any materials of physical evidence, but those=
&gt;  distributed over the Internet are particularly ntrustworthy--even the lower=
&gt;  resolution of net-distribution works to the advantage of the creation of=
&gt;  such materials. I expect this problem to have increasing impact as time=
&gt;  goes on, including in criminal and civil cases (for instance, in the Yousef=
&gt;  case in New York, where he claimed his computer files were faked, or the=
&gt;  potential falsification of photographic evidence in the Simpson civil=
&gt;  trial).
&gt;
&gt; In short, the discussion and materials on/using the Internet have done=
&gt;  little to advance the search for the truth of the matter in TWA 800, and=
&gt;  have done much harm (diverting critical manpower from the investigation,=
&gt;  damaging the credibility of the investigation, etc.).
&gt;
&gt; CIA-Cocaine connection
&gt; TWA and this accusation actually have much in common from a propaganda=
&gt;  standpoint. The allegation (made by the San Jose Mercury News) was that=
&gt;  assets associated with the CIA-backed effort in support of the Contras were=
&gt;  trafficking in cocaine, which helped to finance the (c)overt war. In=
&gt;  particular, the cocaine smuggled into the U.S.A. was supposed to have been=
&gt;  converted into the 'crack' or rock (smokable) form, and introduced into the=
&gt;  African-American urban setting in Los Angeles, with the undertones being=
&gt;  that it was a conspiracy to undermine the solidarity of the A-A community.
&gt;
&gt; Mobile truth: the basic assertion never actually connected the CIA with any=
&gt; =20
&gt; involvement or trafficking, yet the implication (made indirectly or=
&gt;  directly,=20
&gt; depending on the source) was that it was a tacit CIA operation. Far be it=
&gt;  for me to write the apologia for the Agency, but not only is the supposed=
&gt;  action=20
&gt; illegal and immoral, it is also highly unlikely. Creative interpretation of=
&gt;  the=20
&gt; events allowed a rather clever ontological judo--the all-powerful,=
&gt;  all-knowing CIA either had to admit they had no idea what their assets were=
&gt;  involved in (thus damaging the all-knowing aspect of their reputation);=
&gt;  they could admit to knowledge but inaction (thus criminal facilitation, or=
&gt;  having to say that sometimes they need the help of 'bad' people, not a=
&gt;  politically correct position); or they could deny any involvement, and=
&gt;  foster the continual suspicion of cover-up, conspiracy, and hidden agendas.=
&gt;  Any way they move, they lose. This is again a position where history has=
&gt;  created an impression that the Agency would perform the worst action in=
&gt;  support of their own agenda,=20and then actively protect themselves from=
&gt;  investigation; no amount of reform or whitewashing can reverse the trend.=
&gt;  The strength of this attack on the credibility of the Agency is that it=
&gt;  plays so well with public impressions of the Agency, appears to fit the=
&gt;  profile of previous Agency violations of public trust, but can't be=
&gt;  defended against because of the secrecy requirements of the Agency, and the=
&gt;  improbable success of proving a negative assertion (that the Agency wasn't=
&gt;  responsible).
&gt;
&gt; PsyOps: a factor to consider is that the accusations were made during an=20
&gt; election period in a key state where the issue solidified a constituency=
&gt;  into a=20
&gt; solid position against their 'traditional' opposition. The issue is very=
&gt;  much a=20
&gt; political one, and directed at rekindling public animosity about past deeds=
&gt;  (and misdeeds) to shape current public impressions. Again, the long term=
&gt;  casualties of all this are the public trust and credibility of a key but=
&gt;  troubled Agency; politically expedient attacks which undermine the=
&gt;  political process; and the continued progression of the perversion of the=
&gt;  information environment.
&gt;
&gt; Fictive environment: no proof was actually offered (mostly proof by=
&gt;  assertion, as well as collateral association), but the very absence of=
&gt;  proof feeds in to the mobile truth and psyops elements of the operation.=
&gt;  Clearly no public documentation and argument could be offered from an=
&gt;  Agency that must maintain its security and integrity, and no proof could be=
&gt;  offered to prove the Agency wasn't involved, a negative assertion (a common=
&gt;  element in this sort of propaganda operation).
&gt;
&gt; The CIA, Congress, and Justice Department are now engaged in investigations=
&gt;  of the allegations; as such, they will be on-going events to continue the=
&gt;  propaganda campaign, with a predictable end--the Agency finds no proof in=
&gt;  their records and interviews, which is then interpreted as continuing=
&gt;  evidence of a cover-up and conspiracy.
&gt;
&gt; Conclusion-- Media manipulation, particularly using the Internet as a method=
&gt;  of propagation of the propaganda message or as an entry point into the=
&gt;  conventional media cycle, is becoming more of a problem. Clearly everyone=
&gt;  suffers, and the general atmosphere of distrust and disbelief, not to=
&gt;  mention disgust, prevail.

&gt; To:     infowar@infowar.com
&gt; From: winn@infowar.com
&gt; Date:  November 8, 1996
&gt; Subj:  Electronic Civil Defense Becomes a National Issue
&gt;
&gt; In June of 1991, I testified before Congress that unless we moved forward as=
&gt;  a nation, we faced the possible specter of an "Electronic Pearl Harbor."=
&gt;  Five years to the day later, that same phrase was used by John Deutch and=
&gt;  others to wake up Congress and America that indeed a new concept of=
&gt;  national security has evolved as the Cold War wound down.
&gt;
&gt; I recently ran into a Libertarian friend and lawyer who was somewhat upset=
&gt;  with me. "You are single handedly responsible for the backlash and efforts=
&gt;  of law enforcement to take away our personal freedoms." He was referring to=
&gt;  the comments made by FBI Director Louis Freeh, that additional electronic=
&gt;  eavesdropping capabilities were needed to thwart the threats of domestic=
&gt;  terrorism. He also referred to various law enforcement concerns that unless=
&gt;  US citizens voluntarily complied with a Key Escrow scheme of some variety,=
&gt;  it might be necessary to legislate a common cryptographic system which=
&gt;  would not interfere with government investigations into crime and=
&gt;  terrorism.
&gt;
&gt; "So, it's all my fault?" I asked him in the presence of others.
&gt;
&gt; He paused, and with only a twinge of humor said, "yes."
&gt;
&gt; Well, I do not believe or accept for a moment that the work we have done in=
&gt;  the last several years is solely responsible for the extreme measures being=
&gt;  discussed, but my friend's concerns are legitimate and must be addressed.=
&gt;  He is keenly concerned, as many of us are, that recent headline grabbing=
&gt;  events may trigger law enforcement to overreact and with the emotional=
&gt;  support of many Americans, permit laws to be passed that a few short years=
&gt;  ago we never would have tolerated.
&gt;
&gt; Civil Libertarians are quick to point out that if we permit law enforcement=
&gt;  to regain unbridled powers of electronic eavesdropping, we provide them=
&gt;  with the capability of abuse.
&gt;
&gt; "Today's government may be fine. But we don't know about tomorrow's=
&gt;  government." They openly refer to the abuses of the Hoover FBI where, most=
&gt;  of will admit, things did get out of hand. I've met with CIA case officers=
&gt;  who feel hamstrung by their inability "to get the job done" in an effective=
&gt;  way, because they are paying for the sins of their predecessors. Most of=
&gt;  the FBI agents I know understand the legitimate fears of the civil=
&gt;  liberties groups, but also know that they must have increased access to=
&gt;  technology to defeat criminal activities.
&gt;
&gt; The issue comes down to one of balance. Pure and simple. "Whom do you trust"=
&gt;  is a high profile collateral issue.=20
&gt;
&gt; But let's understand what has catalyzed much of these moves on the part of=
&gt;  law enforcement:
&gt;
&gt; 	- The Oklahoma City bombing
&gt; 	- The World Trade Center bombing
&gt; 	- The Lockerbie Tragedy
&gt; 	- The US Military Bombing in Saudi Arabia
&gt; 	- TWA Flight 800
&gt; 	- The Olympic Bombing
&gt;
&gt; These events trigger deep emotional responses on the part of most Americans=
&gt;  and a call for action. "What can we do?" "Do something." "This shouldn't=
&gt;  happen in America." "Protect us." And the predictable response from law=
&gt;  enforcement is to ask for additional powers. Balance. It's all about=
&gt;  balance.
&gt;
&gt; The critics say that Law Enforcement can push electronic taps past friendly=
&gt;  judges with little inquiry on their part. The FBI says it takes a mass of=
&gt;  paper work and evidence to convince a judge. There were less than 2,000=
&gt;  phone taps issued last year - and I guess I feel that's not a whole lot.=
&gt;  260,000,000 people, less than 2,000 taps. You add it up.=20
&gt;
&gt; Resources on the part of law enforcement are pretty scant. They do not have=
&gt;  the budget or manpower to indiscriminately tap phones everywhere and=
&gt;  analyze their contents. It's manpower intensive. They have to be selective.=
&gt;  In many ways I wish they listened in on more of the bad guys. On one phone=
&gt;  tap, an FBI agent told me, their target said in a taped conversation, "hey,=
&gt;  the feds are tapping the phone. Let's whisper." Bad guys are not all rocket=
&gt;  scientists.
&gt;
&gt; But on a national scale, we do indeed face a new risk, a new vulnerability,=
&gt;  for which my friend blames me. It's all my fault. Right. In "Information=
&gt;  Warfare" and other works, I maintained that the civilian infrastructure was=
&gt;  the unacknowledged target of future adversaries.
&gt;
&gt; I don't believe we will see Submarines sailing up the Potomac, or that enemy=
&gt;  planes will come into San Francisco Bay. Just won't happen. But I fear we=
&gt;  will see attacks against the econo-technical infrastructure, affecting not=
&gt;  only we citizens, but the ability of law enforcement and the military to=
&gt;  function as we wish them to.
&gt;
&gt; On July 15 of this year, President Clinton issued an Executive Order calling=
&gt;  for the Establishment of  President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure=
&gt;  Protection.
&gt;
&gt; I applaud much of it, but I also think we have to maintain caution on how it=
&gt;  is effected. His order says:
&gt;
&gt; Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or=
&gt;  destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic=
&gt;  security of the United States.
&gt;
&gt; These critical infrastructures include:
&gt;
&gt;  telecommunications,
&gt;  electrical power systems,
&gt;  gas and oil storage and transportation,
&gt;  banking and finance,
&gt;  transportation,
&gt;  water supply systems,
&gt;  emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue), and
&gt;  continuity of government.
&gt;
&gt; Threats to these critical infrastructures fall into two categories:
&gt;
&gt; 1. physical threats to tangible property ("physical threats"),
&gt;
&gt; 2. and threats of electronic, radio-frequency, or computer-based attacks on=
&gt;  the information or communications components that control critical=
&gt;  infrastructures ("cyber threats").
&gt;
&gt; Because many of these critical infrastructures are owned and operated by the=
&gt;  private sector, it is essential that the government and private sector work=
&gt;  together to develop a strategy for protecting them and assuring their=
&gt;  continued operation.
&gt;
&gt; This part of President Clinton's statement is right on the mark. These are=
&gt;  all critical structures of the macro-sized econo-technical infrastructure,=
&gt;  of which the NII and other bits are sub-infrastructures. However, when it=
&gt;  comes to forming a committee, the people and groups he wishes to handle the=
&gt;  problem are quite government-centric.
&gt;
&gt; 	- Department of the Treasury;
&gt; 	- Department of Justice;
&gt; 	- Department of Defense;
&gt; 	- Department of Commerce;
&gt; 	- Department of Transportation;
&gt; 	- Department of Energy;
&gt; 	- Central Intelligence Agency;
&gt; 	- Federal Emergency Management Agency;
&gt; 	- Federal Bureau of Investigation;
&gt; 	- National Security Agency.
&gt;
&gt; The committee members are to include:
&gt;
&gt; 	- Secretary of the Treasury;
&gt; 	- Secretary of Defense;
&gt; 	- Attorney General;
&gt; 	- Secretary of Commerce;
&gt; 	- Secretary of Transportation;
&gt; 	- Secretary of Energy;
&gt; 	- Director of Central Intelligence;
&gt; 	- Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
&gt; 	- Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
&gt; 	- Assistant to the President for National  Security Affairs;
&gt; 	- Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs.
&gt;
&gt; The immediate concern I see is that the government wants to take charge on=
&gt;  an issue and threat that is of mutual concern to the private sector and the=
&gt;  government, but that at the highest levels of the President's Order and his=
&gt;  Committee, we see no private sector representation. It is merely on a=
&gt;  consultory basis.
&gt;
&gt; The Commission shall:
&gt;
&gt;         (a) within 30 days of this order, produce a statement of its mission=
&gt;  objectives, which will elaborate the general objectives set forth in this=
&gt;  order, and a detailed schedule for addressing each mission objective, for=
&gt;  approval by the Steering Committee;
&gt;
&gt;         (b) identify and consult with: (i) elements of the public and=
&gt;  private  sectors that conduct, support, or contribute to infrastructure=
&gt;  assurance; (ii) owners and operators of the critical infrastructures; and=
&gt;  (iii) other elements of the public and private sectors, including the=
&gt;  Congress, that have an interest in critical infrastructure assurance issues=
&gt;  and that may have differing perspectives on these issues;
&gt;
&gt;         (c) assess the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities of, and=
&gt;  threats to, critical infrastructures;
&gt;
&gt;         (d) determine what legal and policy issues are raised by efforts to=
&gt;  protect critical infrastructures and assess how these issues should be=
&gt;  addressed;
&gt;
&gt;         (e) recommend a comprehensive national policy and implementation=
&gt;  strategy for protecting critical infrastructures from physical and cyber=
&gt;  threats and assuring their continued operation;
&gt;
&gt;         (f) propose any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to effect=
&gt;  its recommendations; and
&gt;
&gt;         (g) produce reports and recommendations to the Steering Committee as=
&gt;  they become available; it shall not limit itself to producing one final=
&gt;  report.
&gt;
&gt; I first wrote a National Infomation Policy in 1993, and I am pleased to see=
&gt;  that the President has included similar wording. However, a national policy=
&gt;  must, on balance, also provide for enhanced personal electronic security=
&gt;  for the average American. It cannot be a one-sided law enforcement issue.=
&gt; =20
&gt;
&gt; I worry about "consult with industry" along the same lines that the Key=
&gt;  Escrow adherents consulted with industry, but generally did what they=
&gt;  wanted to anyway. This has been an ongoing battle between industry and the=
&gt;  White House with respect to "Clipper" style proposals and export control=
&gt;  over encryption. Do we face the same situation with the Infrastructure=
&gt;  Protection Committee?
&gt;
&gt; In this same vein, the President did recognize some input by the private=
&gt;  sector:
&gt;
&gt; (a) The Commission shall receive advice from an advisory committee=
&gt;  ("Advisory Committee") composed of no more than ten individuals appointed=
&gt;  by the President from the private sector who are knowledgeable about=
&gt;  critical infrastructures. The Advisory Committee shall advise the=
&gt;  Commission on the subjects of the Commission's mission in whatever manner=
&gt;  the Advisory Committee, the Commission Chair, and the Steering Committee=
&gt;  deem appropriate.
&gt;
&gt; Again, the structure is that the government is in charge and the private=
&gt;  sector, whose very interests are at stake here, is reduced to an Advisory=
&gt;  status. This is a keen focus of concern.
&gt;
&gt; But then, a surprising phrase was in the President's Order:
&gt;
&gt; (f) The Commission, the Principals Committee, the Steering Committee, and=
&gt;  the Advisory Committee shall terminate 1 year from the date of this order,=
&gt;  unless extended by the President prior to that date.
&gt;
&gt; Only a year. I've been at this for years and years, and the awareness=
&gt;  process takes significant time. There are still major players both in the=
&gt;  government and the private sector who do not understand the nature of the=
&gt;  threats and vulnerabilities, and I fear that a mere one year effort, led by=
&gt;  some of the busiest people in the country today, will not receive the=
&gt;  attention it deserves.
&gt;
&gt; My Civil Libertarian lawyer friend had significant problems with the=
&gt;  following portion of the President's Order (for which I am blamed, of=
&gt;  course!).
&gt;
&gt; (a) While the Commission is  conducting its analysis and until the President=
&gt;  has an opportunity to consider and act on its recommendations, there is a=
&gt;  need to increase  coordination of existing infrastructure protection=
&gt;  efforts in order to better address, and prevent, crises that would have a=
&gt;  debilitating regional or national impact.  There is hereby established an=
&gt;  Infrastructure Protection Task Force ("IPTF") within the Department of=
&gt;  Justice, chaired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to undertake this=
&gt;  interim coordinating mission.
&gt;
&gt; (d) The IPTF shall include at least one full-time member each from the=
&gt;  Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, and the=
&gt;  National Security Agency.  It shall also receive part-time assistance from=
&gt;  other executive branch departments and agencies. Members shall be=
&gt;  designated by their departments or agencies on the basis of their expertise=
&gt;  in the protection of critical   infrastructures.  IPTF members'=
&gt;  compensation shall be paid by their parent agency or department.
&gt;
&gt; "Oh, great!" he exclaimed. "Now we're gonna have the Army sitting with=
&gt;  M-16's outside the phone company, and the NSA listening in on Americans to=
&gt;  see if they pollute the water supply. This is too damned much." He=
&gt;  shuddered at the thought of having the these three groups working together=
&gt;  on a domestic basis. It brought back to him too many memories of bygone=
&gt;  days he would like to see remain in the past.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, what better group than the DoD to head up an effective=
&gt;  response organization? The President, rightfully so, put the FBI and the=
&gt;  Dept. of Justice in charge of the IPTF; after all they are responsible for=
&gt;  domestic national law enforcement. But the DoD has massive resources,=
&gt;  capabilities and manpower to deploy in times of trouble.
&gt;
&gt; The trouble is, and we will have to face this dilemma straight on, is that=
&gt;  the US Military cannot be deployed in domestically due to the Posse=
&gt;  Comitatus Act of 1878, without an Executive Order. And the NSA is similarly=
&gt;  restricted from domestic operation, but is standing up its own 1,000 man=
&gt;  Information Warfare division.=20
&gt;
&gt; There are legitimate ways around these problems, and we do need to have=
&gt;  built-in oversights to satisfy the concerns of those who don't want the=
&gt;  government taking over the whole shebang. But the concept of the IPTF's=
&gt;  mission is again, absolutely on mark.
&gt;
&gt; (e) The IPTF's function is to identify and coordinate existing expertise,=
&gt;  inside and outside of the Federal Government, to:
&gt;
&gt; (i) provide, or facilitate and coordinate the provision of, expert guidance=
&gt;  to critical infrastructures to detect, prevent, halt, or confine an attack=
&gt;  and to recover and restore service;
&gt;
&gt; (ii) issue threat and warning notices in the event advance information is=
&gt;  obtained about a threat;
&gt;
&gt; (iii) provide training and education on methods of reducing vulnerabilities=
&gt;  and responding to attacks on critical infrastructures;
&gt;
&gt; (iv) conduct after-action analysis to determine possible future threats,=
&gt;  targets, or methods of attack; and
&gt;
&gt; (v)  coordinate with the pertinent law enforcement authorities during or=
&gt;  after an attack to facilitate any resulting criminal investigation.
&gt;
&gt; The Committee is supposed to address the very issues that many of us have=
&gt;  been addressing - to full audiences, but often empty years. From where I=
&gt;  stand, the White House has caught the vision and it prepared to do=
&gt;  something about it.
&gt;
&gt; My complaints are essentially two fold:
&gt;
&gt; 	1. We have to have greater civilian input and representation on the=
&gt;  Committee at the highest levels, not merely in an advisory capacity.
&gt;
&gt; 	2. The 1 year term is short-sided.
&gt;
&gt; And yes, I do agree with my Libertarian pal, that however this all shakes=
&gt;  out, we must have a third party oversight process to insure we never do=
&gt;  return to the abusive days of yore.
&gt;
&gt; Kudos to the White House for putting Electronic Civil Defense on their=
&gt;  plate.
