&gt; &gt; It's not an abuse of power. It was an effort to curtail inappropriate
&gt; &gt; SPAM. Much like this entire topic has become non-crypto SPAM on the
&gt; &gt; cypherpunks list.
&gt;
&gt; No it was not SPAM.  John Gilmore attacked Vulis's style, plain
&gt; and simple.  Next time I see John GilMore, I will call him a
&gt; censorous motherfucker in public.

Thank you, Dr. Grubor. I fully agree with your assessment of John Gilmore.
Note that the claim that I write "SPAM" (in capital letters) is a lie, and
probably actionable.

&gt; &gt; Please, the EFF is NOT a Cypherpunks organization. They may share

Neither has any credibility anymore.

&gt; &gt; some of the same goals, but they arn't the same. This should be obvious
&gt; &gt; to even the most logicly deficient.
&gt; &gt; Oh, and it's spelled "internet",
&gt;
&gt; No it is not, asshole!  That is the old way of doing things.
&gt; It is NOW and always will be the "InterNet" -- I helped build the
&gt; motherfucker in 1969, I should know.

Thank you, Dr. Grubor, for your monumental contributions.

&gt; and when use inside a sentance, it isn't
&gt; &gt; capitolized, no matter what Bill tells you.
         ^
&gt;
&gt; No, it is capitalized, because Grubor tells you.
&gt; The name is the GruBoursyNet.

Yes - the self-appointed censor can't even spell. What a maroon.

&gt; &gt; And if you pulled the plug
&gt; &gt; on any of your 6 lists, the members would have the option of reforming
&gt; &gt; another list someplace else, but it would be YOUR OPTION to pull the
&gt; &gt; plug, unless you were "only" the adminstrator, and not the list "owner".
&gt; &gt; John owns the list in the classic sense. (Ok I realize I may have lost
&gt; &gt; you there Mr. "InterNet", but the way it works is that either organizations
&gt; &gt; or individuals own lists, in this case it's an individual.)

Of course it's John's right to censor his own mailing list. He does too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The first time is the time when you lose all credibility, and there
&gt; &gt; &gt; is never any forgiveness for a plug-puller.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All bullshit aside, this whole thing has NOTHING to do with crypto.
&gt; &gt; And it has very VERY little to do with censorship either. And it's
&gt; &gt; gotten way, way out of hand. I suggest that it might be better not
&gt; &gt; to spam cypherpunks with this stuff, and to give it a rest. Between
&gt;
&gt; I never would join that mailing list, because it is all a bunch
&gt; of shit.  The EFF must die, and that is all there is to it.

The EFF can continue to exist as a reminder of how corporate interests
try to misappropriate the appearance of defending free speech while in
fact engaging in plug-pulling and censorship.

&gt; Stupid pervert cabal.cocksucker, I bet.

Most definitely.

&gt; Does John Gilmore suck tale's cock, too?

I wouldn't be surprised the least bit. Many unhappy customers of Cygnus
Support have found out that the only requirement for being hired by Cugnus
is to be gay; it doesn't matter whether you know anything about the product
you're supposed to support. Thus, Cygnus rips off not only the software
writers (who put their software on the Internet for everyone to use, not
for John Gilmore to get rich(er) with), but also their gullible customers.
