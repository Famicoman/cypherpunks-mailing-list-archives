&gt;&gt; &gt;Your circle of associations must be limited.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Examples [of people who have suffered due to loss of privacy]?
&gt;
&gt;Phil Zimmermann often tells the story of a woman whose marriage
&gt;was destroyed by the revelation of a long-past indiscretion. 
&gt;After her husband divorced her, she committed suicide.

Deceiving your spouse is not a good reason to protect your privacy.

&gt;Any number of celebrities have been stalked, attacked and even
&gt;killed by obsessed fans who found them through public records.

Unfortunately most readers of this list do not have this problem.

&gt;Every year, children and business executives are kidnapped for
&gt;ransom.  The proximate cause of these kidnappings is a breach in
&gt;privacy about the whereabouts and schedules of the victim.  

Or this problem.

&gt;Hitler's gun registration in Germany allowed the Jews to be
&gt;disarmed.  I'm sure you are aware of the ultimate consequences
&gt;of that little invasion of privacy.

Not a bad example, but genocide happens rarely.

Those alert enough to protect their privacy in advance might be alert
enough to get out in time, anyway.

Subjective utility: low.

&gt;The US Post Office co-operated in the identification and 
&gt;imprisonment of people of Japanese ancestry during the second
&gt;world war.

97,000 victims over a ~100 year period.  Doesn't really show up on the
scope, sorry.  (Plus downside bad, but few were murdered.)

&gt;The problem with having a whole lot of private information about
&gt;you floating around in public is not what damage it can do to you
&gt;now, but rather the problems it potentially could cause in the
&gt;future.  Just about everyone on this list has been to university.
&gt;Not long ago, a college education was essentially a death warrant 
&gt;in Cambodia.  Prior to that, a degree was considered a good thing
&gt;there.  People saw no reason to hid the fact that they had been
&gt;in school.  Trouble is, things changed.
&gt;
&gt;And the trouble today is that things can change now, too.  Think
&gt;about the things that you have publicly done or advocated.  Even
&gt;if they are as legal as church on Sunday NOW, how comfortable 
&gt;will you be about them if there is extreme right or left takeover
&gt;in the future?  Start to get the picture?

These things CAN happen.  Will they happen?  Odds are low.

BTW, are you operating under your True Name?
