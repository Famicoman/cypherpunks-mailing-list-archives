&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see any reason why this wouldn't be true for a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (but seizure is not forfeiture) of "property that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constitutes evidence of the commission of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; criminal offense".

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please forgive my naivete, but are there no legal
&gt; &gt; weapons available to the 'victims' in such cases?
&gt; &gt; I'm passingly familiar with the Operation Sundevil
&gt; &gt; fiasco -- i.e., with the outcome re the principal
&gt; &gt; 'charges'.  I'm appalled, however, at the apparent
&gt; &gt; lack of remedies for return of such seized property.
&gt; &gt; Are individuals who find themselves in such a
&gt; &gt; predicament simply at the government's mercy (there's
&gt; &gt; an oxymoron for ya)??
&gt; 
&gt; Just in case someone replies saying "It's not all that bad", or "It can't
&gt; happen here", etc., you should know this:
&gt; 
&gt; The United States government has not been responsive to the people for
&gt; a long time, but what's become evident in recent years is that they're
&gt; also no longer responsive to basic law and order.
&gt; 
&gt; They do respond to extreme pressure, as was applied in the Weaver, Waco,
&gt; and other similar cases, but, as a general rule, they do whatever they
&gt; want all the way to the top of the Justice dept. with impunity.
&gt; 
&gt; Example:  George Bush's old pal at the Wash. DC P.R. firm hires the
&gt; niece(?) of a Kuwaiti official to testify in front of Congress in full
&gt; view of the American people on television, that the Iraquis were throwing
&gt; babies out of incubators in Kuwait, thereby securing the necessary votes
&gt; in Congress to prosecute the Gulf War.
&gt; 
&gt; When it was discovered (after the "war") that the Incubator Baby Scandal
&gt; was a lie, nobody was prosecuted.  Further, in blatant violation of the
&gt; U.S. Constitution, Bush and Schwartzkopf were knighted by Queen Elizabeth
&gt; II of England.
&gt; 
&gt; There are also numerous examples of the Justice dept. being caught red-
&gt; handed forging documents to frame people for whom they had no evidence or
&gt; insufficient evidence to prosecute, and what happens in those cases?
&gt; Nothing.
