&gt; An Essay by L. R. Beam
&gt; The internet, perhaps the last truly free means of information exchange
&gt; in the Western World, may soon be choked by censorship and governmental
&gt; controls. The circumscribing of the net may cause the death of what has
&gt; become the first people-to-people exchange of ideas and information on a
&gt; world wide basis. The forces behind this effort appear at first glance to
&gt; be an unlikely coalition of conspirators, the CIA, some Jewish Religious
&gt; groups, and various foreign governments. While this unholy alliance for
&gt; censorship and control may seem unusual to some, politics makes the bed
&gt; for these strange fellows. Indisputably, an international cabal of
&gt; special interest groups both within and out of governments are working
&gt; both openly and secretly to end the unregulated direct exchange of
&gt; information between people. At stake is nothing less then the regaining
&gt; of information control which the internet has shattered. Up for grabs is
&gt; nothing more than the thinking and decision making abilities of informed men.

[snip, snip]

&gt; In closing the author would like to make two additional things clear.
&gt; First, there are Jews who oppose censorship although to this point their
&gt; voice is but a whisper compared to the intolerance of the Anti-Defamation
&gt; League and Rabbi Cooper. Second, that writing about Jewish religious
&gt; leaders and government spymasters operating in a collusive effort to
&gt; erect an electron iron curtain to restrict freedom of speech and
&gt; information does not make one anti-Semitic or anti-government. The truth
&gt; is anti-Semitic. The government is erecting a police state. The author
&gt; opposes both oppressive religious groups and repressive government. If
&gt; speaking the truth and opposing tyranny makes one anti-Semitic and
&gt; anti-government, then I am both...

I wish there were a way to inform people that the ADL is not a "Jewish"
group just because they so claim.  Informed persons have pointed to the
not-so-coincidental founding of this organization at approximately the
same time as the Federal Reserve and the Income Tax, and just a few years
after the founding of the FBI by Napoleon's grandson.

Word is that while the World Jewish Congress declared war on Hitler in
1933, the ADL actually *suppressed* Jewish dissent in the U.S., at least
until 1937-38, because it was "good for business". I wouldn't call these
ADL people "Jewish", I'd call them pals of Prescott Bush and Averell
Harriman, to name a couple of supreme scumbags.  The same people and
ideology who propped up Hitler are foaming at the mouth now over their
good fortunes in China and other parts of SE Asia.

As far as whether a person's ethnicity makes a difference in their govt.
positions, a la the DCI, it's my feeling that certain ties and loyalties
are exploited by the scum at the top for their own gain (and they don't
give a damn about religion, at least in any normal sense), and to see a
possible analogy for this, look at Stone's JFK movie, where the CIA et al
were using gay men that they could blackmail at the time, for jobs where
they didn't want people to talk.

BTW, 1913 (nice number, huh?) was the year for the 3 things listed above.
Those things were enacted in the Taft administration, Taft being the
grandson of the founder of Skull and Bones, the control group for the
Bush and Harriman clan.  Wot a coincidence, eh?
