&gt; &gt; Subject: I urgently need a lot of money.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please share your money-making secrets, I am in a desperate need
&gt; &gt; for cash.
&gt; 
&gt; For shame! Igor Chewed-off disgraces his Chewish Mommy by even asking. Isn't
&gt; propensity for "gesheft" genetic? Here's another money-making idea for Igor:
&gt; 
&gt; Igor obtains a list of e-mail addresses of people interested in equity-related
&gt; investments (e.g. by watching misc.invest.* and sending the posters / those who
&gt; voted for their creation unsolicited e-mail; or by posting anonymous ads,
&gt; inviting the readers to reply to a reply block in order to receive 3 free
&gt; promotional issues of an investment advice newsletter; or even by starting up
&gt; his own private financial derivatives mailing list). Igor divides the mailing
&gt; list into 2^3=8 parts, and gives them exotic Russian-sounding names: Aleksej,
&gt; Boris, Vasilij, Grigorij, Dmitrij, Elena, Zhenja, Zoya.
&gt; 
&gt; Igor then uses an anonymous remailer to spam everyone on his mailing list with
&gt; the 8 variants of the following message: "Congratulations! You have won 3 free
&gt; issued of the _Boris Investment Newsletter, published in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by a
&gt; proud holder of a Master's Degree in Financial Engineering from the Moscow
&gt; State University. I predict that within the next month Adobe stock will go up."
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of "Boris", Igor will substitute one of the 8 newsletter names; instead
&gt; of Adobe, he can use any volatile stock that's as likely to go up as down; and
&gt; the predicted stock price movement will be "up" in the first four newsletters
&gt; and "down" in the other four.
&gt; 
&gt; One month later the stock in question is either up or down. Without loss of
&gt; generality, suppose that it's gone down. Aleksej, Boris, Vasilij, and
&gt; Grigorij's investment advice was wrong, they disappear from the face of the
&gt; earth, and the former recipients of their newsletters don't get bothered any
&gt; more. (Or they could be recycled for future scams; or they could be send the
&gt; remaining 2 issues of worthless advice, as promised.) On the other hand
&gt; Dmitrij, Elena, Zhenja, and Zoya guessed right, so this time they send out a
&gt; new investment newsletter via the anonymous remailers:
&gt; 
&gt; "Congratulations! You continue to receive the free investment advice newsletter
&gt; from Zoya in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Last month I correctly predicted that Adobe will
&gt; have gone down. If you're smart, you've shorted Adobe's stock and made lots of
&gt; money by now. This month I predict that Cisco will go _down as well."
&gt; 
&gt; Again, Dmitrij and Elena predict that some other volatile stock goes up, while
&gt; Zhenja and Zoya predict that it goes down. Suppose D&amp;E are right. Igor leaves
&gt; the Zh.&amp;Z. partitions alone. One month later D&amp;E's subscribers get letter #3:
&gt; 
&gt; "Congratulations! You continue to receive the free investment advice newsletter
&gt; from Elena in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two months ago I predicted that Adobe would go
&gt; down. I hope you sold it short. Last month I predicted that Cisco would go up.
&gt; I hope you bought it. This month I predict that Lucent will go _up."
&gt; 
&gt; One month later one of the two is right, so its recipients get the fourth and
&gt; final e-mail from an anonymous remailer, this time using a reply block:
&gt; 
&gt; "I've given you three free stock tips over the last 3 months which probably
&gt; made you a lot of money. Now that you've seen my track record, you'll want to
&gt; continue receiving my free advice, but the free promotion is over. Please send
&gt; $20 in untraceable digital cash to this reply block to receive 6 future
&gt; issues."
&gt; 
&gt; Quite a few people would risk the $20, but that would be the last they hear
&gt; from Igor. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; (Alternatively, he can even e-mail 6 more issues of worthless advice to those
&gt; who caughed up the $20, so they can't complain. It would be hard to prosecute
&gt; Igor without proving that all 8 newsletters were published by the same person
&gt; who's been giving contradictory advice to different people.)
&gt; 
But what Law would you charge him with?
Unless you could prove his "intent" I see no way that you
could ever prove any case against him.

He just says that because he spent his.

when we got the info that the Startronix was going to be late,
we sold STNX short at $1.03 ...

They are almost two months late; is STNX it a hoax?
