&gt; &gt;is flawed.  Virtual space does not have the same limitations as physical
&gt; &gt;space.  Starting your own mailing list is relatively easy.
&gt; Not at all easy, for a lot of people. Moreover, it's very time-consuming.
&gt; It's only easy if you are prepared to put up with costs of time, money,
&gt; and also... service providers (who don't always agree with you)...

     It is not that difficult in term of money or access to start a 
mailing list. 

    I believe there is a equation that operates in life that goes something
like this:
   
    Intelligence + Money + Time * will = Results 

    As one goes up, the other two can drop. Will is kinda nebulous, but is 
always less than result.

    I am not a rocket scientist, but I was able to get majordomo to work
(to a degree) on a server I own, yes, I own the server, and no, I don't 
pay for it with cash. I do a favor for someone, and they gave me the 
machine (<A  HREF="http://www.encodex.com/~pov">http://www.encodex.com/~pov</A> to see the favor). The access is 
provided by some people I occasionally do work for, as long as the machine
is not causing a problem, or too much bandwidth, they let me run it.

    This would make the equation:

    Intelligence + money + time * will = Result
        Some     +  0    + a bit * some = A server with 4 or 5 mailing lists. 

&gt; In a lot of places in the world, starting mailing lists is almost
&gt; impossible unless you can be _inside_ an Internet Provider Company
&gt; (and use Unix or whatever they use, in their own machines).
    
     A simple mailing list could simply be a 8 dollar a month email account
with a long .forward file.  

&gt; Man you're nutts. There are very few and quite vast Media Companies
&gt; in the world, and they're on the verge of becoming monopolies.

     For every "tentacle" of the Vast Media Conglomerates, there is 
some loose nut with a photocopier (or access to Kinko's). 

&gt; Even your American President is in reality a puppet of the Trilateral
&gt; Commission, who effectively also control CNN, the Washington Post,
&gt; and many many many other things all over the world.

     WHO is nuts? 

&gt; And you are saying that control of the media by ownership is
&gt; impossible?  You're far out maaan! :-)
&gt; Only in America such a naive opinion could actually be _believed_.
&gt; (here I go again... aga! :-) )
&gt; George
&gt; P.S. Even if you offered me a million dollars I'd stay away from
&gt;      your country. My sanity is much more valuable.  :-)
&gt;      (The Immigration Authorities in the U.S. have missed the point:
&gt;       We DON'T want to come to you guys. It's the last thing we'd want!)

     One of these days reality is going to hit you like a runaway 
freight train.
