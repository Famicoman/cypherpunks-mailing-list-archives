&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see any reason why this wouldn't be true for a

&gt; &gt; &gt; constitutes evidence of the commission of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; criminal offense".

&gt; Please forgive my naivete, but are there no legal
&gt; weapons available to the 'victims' in such cases?
&gt; I'm passingly familiar with the Operation Sundevil
&gt; fiasco -- i.e., with the outcome re the principal
&gt; 'charges'.  I'm appalled, however, at the apparent
&gt; lack of remedies for return of such seized property.
&gt; Are individuals who find themselves in such a
&gt; predicament simply at the government's mercy (there's
&gt; an oxymoron for ya)??

Just in case someone replies saying "It's not all that bad", or "It can't
happen here", etc., you should know this:

The United States government has not been responsive to the people for
a long time, but what's become evident in recent years is that they're
also no longer responsive to basic law and order.

They do respond to extreme pressure, as was applied in the Weaver, Waco,
and other similar cases, but, as a general rule, they do whatever they
want all the way to the top of the Justice dept. with impunity.

Example:  George Bush's old pal at the Wash. DC P.R. firm hires the
niece(?) of a Kuwaiti official to testify in front of Congress in full
view of the American people on television, that the Iraquis were throwing
babies out of incubators in Kuwait, thereby securing the necessary votes
in Congress to prosecute the Gulf War.

When it was discovered (after the "war") that the Incubator Baby Scandal
was a lie, nobody was prosecuted.  Further, in blatant violation of the
U.S. Constitution, Bush and Schwartzkopf were knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II of England.

There are also numerous examples of the Justice dept. being caught red-
handed forging documents to frame people for whom they had no evidence or
insufficient evidence to prosecute, and what happens in those cases?
Nothing.
