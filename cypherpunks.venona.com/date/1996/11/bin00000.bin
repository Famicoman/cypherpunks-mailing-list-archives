     This sounds like a threat. You got balls aga? You think you can 
hide from the results of your actions? I know women with more balls than
you. I have pencils with more brains. I've scraped dogshit off my shoe
with more manners. 

     It is people like you, who can't argue points from intellect and must 
resort to threats and name calling, then when that fails to denial of 
service attacks, who _will_ get the net regulated, and yes it is possible.
Difficult, but possible. 

     In fact, now that I think about it, I bet you work for the government,
that you get a nice little tiddy sum in the mail every month to allow 
you to carry on your petty little tirades and temper tantrums. To stir shit
up and make people otherwise intelligent people think that maybe, just maybe
a little regulation (censorship) is ok. 

    A space, be it "cyber" or real, can only exist without regulation if every
one is willing to live courtesously (sp?), to be relatively polite to each
other and to overlook the occasional accidental slight. 

   You aren't like that, you are like a foul mouthed drunkard in church, 
puking and pissing everywhere, and complaining when people ask you to leave.

     Tell you what you pathetic little coward, I am bcc'ing this to my 
boss (encodex@encodex.com), my system admistrator (root@smoke.suba.com),
your system adminstrator (postmaster@dhp.com) as well as the techinal contact
for your domain (panzer@dhp.com). Your little flames are pathetic, with out
wit or originality, but you are threatening actions which have consequences 
in the real world, and should either of these sites have any problems, I 
will contact the FBI, and if they don't do anything, dhp.com will suffer 
the same consequences. 

    Again: (to others reading this) your little flames and drivel mean nothing
to me, but you are threatening to take actions which could distrupt other
peoples lives and risk their livelyhoods. That is the mark of a Thug. You 
are no better than a StormTrooper. 

     It is your choice, live like a rational human being (I know it is 
hard, but please try), or suffer the consequences of your actions.

     That would be a really dumb move. You would probably win the fight, 
but in the long run, you'd loose the war.

    Yawn.
