&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; None of that analogy is applicable to the cyberpunks list.
&gt; &gt; When a list gets as big as that, it it no longer to be considered
&gt; &gt; a "mailing-list" but it is a _public_ forum.  The whole problem
&gt; &gt; here is the abuse of power by both the EFF and John Gilmore.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; It's not an abuse of power. It was an effort to curtail inappropriate
&gt; SPAM. Much like this entire topic has become non-crypto SPAM on the
&gt; cypherpunks list. 
&gt; &gt; 

No it was not SPAM.  John Gilmore attacked Vulis's style, plain
and simple.  Next time I see John GilMore, I will call him a
censorous motherfucker in public.

&gt; &gt;   Well then let's put their precious censored mailing list in 
&gt; &gt; the public domain.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, above that you tried to argue that it wasn't a list, but a
&gt; "public forum", logicly then you state that it is allready in
&gt; the "public domain". Then you turn around and say it isn't, and
&gt; should be taken from a private forum into the "public domain".
&gt; Perhaps if you stopped ranting, you might realize your mistake. 
&gt; 

You missed the whole fucking point, and I ain't going
to waste time saying it again.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wrong!  The cyberpunks mailing list is PUBLIC property and should
&gt; &gt; NOT be controlled by John Gilmore!  This just goes to show the real
&gt; &gt; facist censorship motives that the EFF has behind it.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahh, but you previously said it wasn't public property. 
&gt; That aside, just because you say it is, doesn't mean it's so. Now
&gt; I realize that up there at MonopolySoft, that sort of logic actually
&gt; works, but in the real world it doesn't. The content may very well be
&gt; "public property" as such, but the list itself, and where it resides
&gt; are not public property. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Time to kill the EFF, and let it rot in hell.  They are disgrace
&gt; &gt; to the entire InterNet community.  I run 6 different mailing lists,
&gt; &gt; and have NEVER puled the plug on anyone, even when they criticize me.
&gt; 
&gt; Please, the EFF is NOT a Cypherpunks organization. They may share
&gt; some of the same goals, but they arn't the same. This should be obvious
&gt; to even the most logicly deficient. 
&gt; Oh, and it's spelled "internet", 

No it is not, asshole!  That is the old way of doing things.
It is NOW and always will be the "InterNet" -- I helped build the
motherfucker in 1969, I should know.


and when use inside a sentance, it isn't
&gt; capitolized, no matter what Bill tells you. 

No, it is capitalized, because Grubor tells you.
The name is the GruBoursyNet.

&gt; And if you pulled the plug
&gt; on any of your 6 lists, the members would have the option of reforming
&gt; another list someplace else, but it would be YOUR OPTION to pull the
&gt; plug, unless you were "only" the adminstrator, and not the list "owner".
&gt; John owns the list in the classic sense. (Ok I realize I may have lost
&gt; you there Mr. "InterNet", but the way it works is that either organizations
&gt; or individuals own lists, in this case it's an individual.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first time is the time when you lose all credibility, and there
&gt; &gt; is never any forgiveness for a plug-puller.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All bullshit aside, this whole thing has NOTHING to do with crypto.
&gt; And it has very VERY little to do with censorship either. And it's
&gt; gotten way, way out of hand. I suggest that it might be better not
&gt; to spam cypherpunks with this stuff, and to give it a rest. Between

I never would join that mailing list, because it is all a bunch
of shit.  The EFF must die, and that is all there is to it.

&gt; the 2 lists &amp; various people I see represented here, with all due &amp;
&gt; serious respect, you folks have GOT to have better, more important,
&gt; and far more deserving issues to devote your time to. I would hope
&gt; that you would take a few moments and think about those things, and
&gt; consider acting appropriatly in light of those thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; Tim Scanlon
&gt; 

Look Tim, you ain't even on the IFC or the F-K lists, so
what the fuck do you care anyway?  Just go publish this shit
on UseNet, like Mr. Boursy says you should do, and stop
bothering our mailing lists.

Stupid pervert cabal.cocksucker, I bet.

Does John Gilmore suck tale's cock, too?
