	No! :)

	So, if 'anonymous Senator' came out for legalization, it would
be declared that it was Kennedy, source of all Liberal Evil.  Good
policy comes from leaders standing up and leading.  Since they don't,
I'm a crypto-anarchist.  To try and help the Congress become more
effective is not in anyones interest, except that class of person who 
makes their living off the workings of government.

	There are lots of variations on the argument that politics is
from the greek poly, meaning many, and ticks, a small bloodsucking
animal.  My interest in creating new, consensual realities is that I
don't want to be forced to care about the congress.
