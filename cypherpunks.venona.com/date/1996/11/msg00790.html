&gt;&gt;&gt;  My question is as
&gt;&gt; &gt;follows:  If PGP and DES are as secure as thought to be, then why is it
&gt;&gt; &gt;not ruled illegal software, just as they do with silencers, narcotics,
&gt;&gt; &gt;certain type weapons, etc.....
&gt;
&gt;[snippo]
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why does it follow that these must be crackable, or the government would
&gt;&gt; have outlawed them? Despite recent moves to limit encryption, there are
&gt;&gt; currently NO domestic (U.S.) restrictions on crypto.  Nothing prohibits
&gt;&gt; you from using a true One Time Pad, which is mathematically proven to be
&gt;&gt; unbreakable, now and forever, even against infinite resources.  If this
&gt;&gt; is not prohibited (and it isn't), doesn't that refute your argument?
&gt;
&gt;Dale Thorn replies:
&gt;This is a misleading challenge.  There's a helluva difference between the OTP
&gt;and a
&gt;Public Key system.  If, for example, it can be proven that I can crank up PGP
&gt;to its
&gt;most cryptic level, and send the OTP overseas with "absolute security", so
&gt;that I
&gt;can now send messages with the OTP which was crunched with PGP's highest
&gt;security,
&gt;then that would mean something.
&gt;
&gt;My point here is that Ed was asserting that PGP, DES, etc., must be
&gt;crackable, otherwise the U.S. government would have ruled them illegal
&gt;(domestically).  I pointed out that one can legally own and use a true OTP
&gt;with impunity in the U.S., despite its unquestioned unbreakability.
&gt;Therefore, his argument falls.  If it made sense, the USG would have AT LEAST
&gt;outlawed OTP's (which they most assuredly cannot break).
&gt;
&gt;Just so there's no misunderstanding:
&gt;
&gt;1. The OTP is absolutely unbreakable. (if done correctly)
&gt;2. The OTP encryption cannot be decoded on the other end unless you can
&gt;deliver the
&gt;   OTP to the person on the other end by a secure means.
&gt;3. PGP, which is not usually used at its highest level of security (for all
&gt;bits in
&gt;   a message), *will* be used at its highest level of security to send the
&gt;OTP to the
&gt;   person on the other end.
&gt;4. The OTP arrives on the other end, completely safe from snooping.
&gt;
&gt;Now you see the problem.  #4 above can't be assured, and that is why Ed says
&gt;that PGP
&gt;is not shut off "right now", because it's probably not "really secure".
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure what you're claiming here, or what point it is intended to
&gt;demonstrate.  No matter the strength of PGP, delivering a OTP in this fashion
&gt;would render it no longer a OTP.  Besides, this scenario makes no sense.  In
&gt;any case, there is no restriction I know of in sending encrypted data (or
&gt;even One Time Pads) to whomever you choose, by whatever means.  (Granted, if
&gt;you send encrypted traffic to khadafi@libya.gov, or dispatch couriers with
&gt;briefcases handcuffed to their wrists, you might invite suspicion...)
&gt;
&gt;Could you clarify the point you're making above?
&gt;
&gt;I'm amused to think that, in a nation armed with 20,000 or so nukes, the
&gt;paranoid of
&gt;paranoid nation-states as it were, some of the erstwhile intelligent citizens
&gt;think
&gt;that the U.S. military are just sitting around wringing their hands over the
&gt;"fact"
&gt;that the citizens have "unbreakable" crypto.
&gt;
&gt;Bear in mind the Scientific American articles on Public Key crypto back in
&gt;the 1970's.
&gt;The military knew the score back then, and if you think they just sat back
&gt;and allowed
&gt;all this to happen, well, sorry, I don't believe in Santa Claus or the Easter
&gt;Bunny.
&gt;
&gt;Well, while the feds are no doubt powerful, they ARE subject to the same laws
&gt;of mathematics as the rest of us.  While it is _possible_ they know much more
&gt;about factoring than the rest of the world, I find it unlikely that they are
&gt;advanced enough to factor 2000-bit numbers.  (I can't prove it, just as I
&gt;can't prove they don't know how to make their agents invisible.)
&gt;
&gt;And they didn't just sit back and allow this information out -- witness
&gt;Bernstein, et. al., and all the continuing ITAR/GAK fallout.  Of course, I
&gt;expect that some will claim this is just for appearance's sake, so as not to
&gt;make it obvious that they can actually read all our thoughts directly, using
&gt;technology they got from the Greys from Zeta Reticulon...
