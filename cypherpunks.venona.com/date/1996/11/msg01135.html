&gt; Subject: Re: "Freedom Knights" are closet censors 
&gt; 
&gt; What is "censoring other people's censorship?" Say I argue in favor of the
&gt; CDA. Would you censor me then? Why not? Isn't this censoring others
&gt; censorship?
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder why the so-called "Freedom Knights" are so insecure in their
&gt; beliefs that they will not tolerate a dissenting voice on their mailing 
&gt; list. (Let's forget for the moment that my point in subscribing was to
&gt; disrupt it. That's not the point, is it? "More speech, more speech!")

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dave Hayes refuses to let me subscribe and read and contribute to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussions there. Why? Simply because he doesn't like what I have to say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I might criticize him. Truly, censorship says more about the censor than
&gt; &gt; &gt; the censored. 
&gt; &gt; 

No dude, like Dave said, you have to know who to invite to
the Party, since you are responsible for the conduct of all
of your guests.

&gt; &gt; Notice that I now have you arguing -my- side of the argument. Are you
&gt; &gt; so easily controlled? Have you asked yourself why you are that way? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; John Gilmore, on the other hand, has been much more tolerant. He allows
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone to subscribe to cypherpunks and only kicked one person off after
&gt; &gt; &gt; months of ranting and off-topic drivel.
&gt; &gt; 

But John Gilmore and his EFF are the epitome of a corrupt
special interest group, and he will now be forever remembered
as one who "pulls-plugs."


&gt; &gt; An ineffective move with symbolic complications that affect no one but
&gt; &gt; him. Why do you support this? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I wonder why the Freedom Knights want to censor certain newsgroups. As
&gt; &gt; &gt; in their FAQ, where they condemn speech they don't like on the alt.cancel
&gt; &gt; &gt; and alt.nocem newsgroups and advise operators not to carry such
&gt; &gt; &gt; groups. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ah, you finally got the newsgroups right. Good. 
&gt; &gt; 

alt.cancel and alt.nocem are both censorous newsgroups that
should be quashed.

&gt; &gt; I censor other people's censorship. That is what I do. Call me a
&gt; &gt; censor if you will, but if you were truly in support of free speech
&gt; &gt; you would understand. Since you don't, your cry of wolf demonstrates
&gt; &gt; the depth of your consideration of the subject matter.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's time to lift the veil from this public Net-menace!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Knock ya-self out.

&gt; &gt; You -do- realize, of course, that you have to organize the people
&gt; &gt; and create a large group of opposers to my cause.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That is your destiny. Carry it out.

&gt; &gt; Nasrudin arrived at an all-comers horse race mounted on the slowest of oxen.
&gt; &gt; Everyone laughed, an ox cannot run. 
&gt; &gt; "But I have seen it, when it was only a calf, running faster than a horse.",
&gt; &gt; said Nasrudin. "So why should it not run faster, now that it is larger?"
&gt; &gt; 

Let's stay on topic here -- John Gilmore is a censorous asshole
for pulling Vulis's plug.  The topic has nothing to do with
the Freedom-Knights.
