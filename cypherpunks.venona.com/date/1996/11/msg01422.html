	I'm trying to think of a function to replace UNIX's crypt(3).  
My design criteria are as follows:

	1) I want it to be secure.
	2) I would like to use a cryptographic hash.
	3) I would like to use well understood cryptographic primitives.
	4) I would like to use a salt, and I would like the salt to be
	considerably larger than the current salt.
	5) I would like the process to be able to be more computationally
	intensive than crypt(3).
	6) The ability to use the algorithm in any setting domestic (US)
	and abroad is a concern, but not a primary one.

	#1 is important for the obvious reasons.
	#2 is important because a one way hash allows for a secure way of
checking the original password against the entered password.  No password
should be able to be recovered by simply reading a file, or finding an
internal key.
	#3 is basicly a result of #1
	#4 and 5 makes the password system more resistant to a dictionary-
type attack.  Several of the more popular password guessers (ie: Crack)
get a significant speed increase from the fact that they only have to hash 
each of the words once per salt.  I would like it to be possible for each
user to have an independent salt (for any reasonable system size).  I would
also like this function to be able to be scaled to that it can be slower
than crypt(3).  This will also hinder a dictionary attack.
	#6 is a byproduct of silly legal concerns.

The algorithm that I developed was heavily influenced by RFCs 1852 [1] 
and 1828 [2] (IP Authentication using SHA and MD5, respectively), and 
"Keying Hash Functions for Message Authentication" by Mihir Bellare, 
Ran Canetti, and Hugo Krawczyk [3]

This algorithm borrows several concepts from [3]:
	The idea of the keyed hash, where the key is used as the hash's 
	IV, or Initial Value. Its security is completely based on the
	choice of the key, and the strength of the underlying hash
	function.

	The concept of the NMAC (Nested MAC), and security analysis
	of it.


The Algorithm:

Given that:
. = the concatenation operator
P = the user pass phrase
H(m) = the hash of the message m
l = length of the hash returned by H(m)
H(k,m) = the keyed hash of message m, using key k (as the IV)
N = salt, length l = (n1 . n2) where n1 and n2 are sub-salts
i = the iteration number
E = a temporary value = (e1 . e2)
K = key = (k1,k2), where k1 and k2 are the sub-keys used in the NMAC
NMAC(k, m) = H(k1, H(k2, m))

In several cases a value is said to be equal to the concatenation
of two other values (we'll take N as an example); ie 
N = (n1 . n2)
This means that N is divided into two equal sized chunks, n1 and n2.
(n1 . n2) = N

initially:
(1) E = H (P)
(2) k1 = (e1 . n1), k2 = (e2 . n2)
(3) T0 = NMAC(K, n)

And then:
(4) T(i) = NMAC(K, T(i-1) . n . T(i-1))
(repeat (4) a number of times)

In (1) the user pass phrase is hashed using the non keyed hash, and the 
resulting value is kept in E. 

In (2) k1 is formed by concatenating the first half of E and the
first half of the salt.  k2 is formed by concatenating the second
half of the key with the second half of the salt.  Now each sub-key
is of length l.

In (3) the NMAC of n is assigned to T0

and then in (4) T(i) is calculated by doing the NMAC of the value
of the previous hash concatenated with n concatenated with the value
the previous hash.

Step (4) is repeated a known number of iterations.

"Keying Hash Functions..." [3] seems to imply that the security of this
hash would be based on the length of l and the underlying hash function, H.  
Because of the way that K is used, the security granted is a function 
of l/2, not l.  (For further explanation see [3])

I was thinking of implementing this using SHA-1.  
This would lead to a 160 bit value for l, hence the security would be 
based on an 80 bit key.

Some modifications that I have considered, and would like feedback on
are:

I was thinking of making the keys used for the hash come from the
previous hashes, and then hash a constant string.  ie:
T(i) = NMAC(T(i-2) . T(i-1), P . n . P)
instead of having a more-or-less constant key, and constantly changing
what is being hashed.

I also am not sure that the string that I'm hashing is ideal.  
Would (n . P . n ) be better?

I very much appreciate comments on any portion of this, or on my general
approach.
