&gt; 
&gt; November 20, 1996 15:00 GMT                                        Number H-05
&gt; ______________________________________________________________________________
&gt; PROBLEM:       This bulletin addresses the following hoaxes and erroneous
&gt;                warnings: PKZ300 Warning, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda, and
&gt;                Ghost.exe
&gt; PLATFORM:      All, via e-mail
&gt; DAMAGE:        Time lost reading and responding to the messages
&gt; SOLUTION:      Pass unvalidated warnings only to your computer security
&gt;                department or incident response team. See below on how to
&gt;                recognize validated and unvalidated warnings and hoaxes.
&gt; ______________________________________________________________________________
&gt; VULNERABILITY  New hoaxes and warnings have appeared on the Internet and old
&gt; ASSESSMENT:    hoaxes are still being cirulated.
&gt; ______________________________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Introduction
&gt; ============
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer
&gt; viruses and Trojans. However, interspersed among real virus notices are
&gt; computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are
&gt; still time consuming and costly to handle. At CIAC, we find that we are
&gt; spending much more time de-bunking hoaxes than handling real virus incidents.
&gt; This advisory addresses the most recent warnings that have appeared on the
&gt; Internet and are being circulated throughout world today. We will also address
&gt; the history behind virus hoaxes, how to identify a hoax, and what to do if you
&gt; think a message is or is not a hoax. Users are requested to please not spread
&gt; unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojans. If you receive an unvalidated
&gt; warning, don't pass it to all your friends, pass it to your computer security
&gt; manager to validate first. Validated warnings from the incident response teams
&gt; and antivirus vendors have valid return addresses and are usually PGP signed
&gt; with the organization's key.
&gt; 
&gt; PKZ300 Warning
&gt; ==============
&gt; 
&gt; The PKZ300 Trojan is a real Trojan program, but the initial warning about it
&gt; was released over a year ago. For information pertaining to PKZ300 Trojan
&gt; reference CIAC Notes issue 95-10, that was released in June of 1995.
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml</A>
&gt; 
&gt; The warning itself, on the other hand, is gaining urban legend status. There
&gt; has been an extremely limited number of sightings of this Trojan and those
&gt; appeared over a year ago. Even though the Trojan warning is real, the repeated
&gt; circulation of the warning is a nuisance. Individuals who need the current
&gt; release of  PKZIP should visit the PKWARE web page at <A  HREF="http://www.pkware.com">http://www.pkware.com</A>.
&gt; CIAC recommends that you DO NOT recirculate the warning about this particular
&gt; Trojan.
&gt; 
&gt; Irina Virus Hoax
&gt; ================
&gt; 
&gt; The "Irina" virus warnings are a hoax. The former head of an electronic
&gt; publishing company circulated the warning to create publicity for a new
&gt; interactive book by the same name. The publishing company has apologized for
&gt; the publicity stunt that backfired and panicked Internet users worldwide. The
&gt; original warning claimed to be from a Professor Edward Pridedaux of the
&gt; College of Slavic Studies in London; there is no such person or college.
&gt; However, London's School of  Slavonic and East European Studies has been
&gt; inundated with calls. This poorly thought-out publicity stunt was highly
&gt; irresponsible. For more information pertaining to this hoax, reference the
&gt; UK Daily Telegraph at <A  HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">http://www.telegraph.co.uk</A>.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Times Virus Hoax
&gt; =====================
&gt; 
&gt; The "Good Times" virus warnings are a hoax. There is no virus by that name in
&gt; existence today. These warnings have been circulating the Internet for years.
&gt; The user community must become aware that it is unlikely that a virus can be
&gt; constructed to behave in the manner ascribed in the "Good Times" virus
&gt; warning. For more information related to this urban legend, reference CIAC
&gt; Notes 95-09.
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Deeyenda Virus Hoax
&gt; ===================
&gt; 
&gt; The "Deeyenda" virus warnings are a hoax. CIAC has received inqueries
&gt; regarding the validity of the Deeyenda virus. The warnings are very similar
&gt; to those for Good Times, stating that the FCC issued a warning about it,
&gt; and that it is self activating and can destroy the contents of a machine
&gt; just by being downloaded. Users should note that the FCC does not and will
&gt; not issue virus or Trojan warnings. It is not their job to do so. As of this
&gt; date, there are no known viruses with the name Deeyenda in existence. For a
&gt; virus to spread, it  must be executed. Reading a mail message does not execute
&gt; the mail message. Trojans and viruses have been found as executable attachments
&gt; to mail messages, but they must be extracted and executed to do any harm. CIAC
&gt; still affirms that reading E-mail, using typical mail agents, can not activate
&gt; malicious code delivered in or with the message.
&gt; 
&gt; Ghost.exe Warning
&gt; =================
&gt; 
&gt; The Ghost.exe program was originally distributed as a free screen saver
&gt; containing some advertising information for the author's company (Access
&gt; Softek). The program opens a window that shows a Halloween background with
&gt; ghosts flying around the screen. On any Friday the 13th, the program window
&gt; title changes and the ghosts fly off the window and around the screen. Someone
&gt; apparently got worried and sent a message indicating that this might be a
&gt; Trojan. The warning grew until the it said that Ghost.exe was a Trojan that
&gt; would destroy your hard drive and the developers got a lot of nasty phone
&gt; calls (their names and phone numbers were in the About box of the program.)
&gt; A simple phone call to the number listed in the program would have stopped
&gt; this warning from being sent out. The original ghost.exe program is just cute;
&gt; it does not do anything damaging. Note that this does not mean that ghost
&gt; could not be infected with a virus that does do damage, so the normal
&gt; antivirus procedure of scanning it before running it should be followed.
&gt; 
&gt; History of Virus Hoaxes
&gt; =======================
&gt; 
&gt; Since 1988, computer virus hoaxes have been circulating the Internet. In
&gt; October of that year, according to Ferbrache ("A pathology of Computer
&gt; Viruses" Springer, London, 1992) one of the first virus hoaxes was the
&gt; 2400 baud modem virus:
&gt; 
&gt; 	SUBJ: Really Nasty Virus
&gt;  	AREA: GENERAL (1)
&gt; 
&gt;  	I've just discovered probably the world's worst computer virus
&gt;  	yet. I had just finished a late night session of BBS'ing and file
&gt;  	treading when I exited Telix 3 and attempted to run pkxarc to
&gt;  	unarc the software I had downloaded. Next thing I knew my hard
&gt;  	disk was seeking all over and it was apparently writing random
&gt;  	sectors. Thank god for strong coffee and a recent backup.
&gt;  	Everything was back to normal, so I called the BBS again and
&gt;  	downloaded a file. When I went to use ddir to list the directory,
&gt;  	my hard disk was getting trashed again. I tried Procomm Plus TD
&gt;  	and also PC Talk 3. Same results every time. Something was up so I
&gt;  	hooked up to my test equipment and different modems (I do research
&gt;  	and development for a local computer telecommunications company
&gt;  	and have an in-house lab at my disposal). After another hour of
&gt;  	corrupted hard drives I found what I think is the world's worst
&gt;  	computer virus yet. The virus distributes itself on the modem sub-
&gt;  	carrier present in all 2400 baud and up modems. The sub-carrier is
&gt;  	used for ROM and register debugging purposes only, and otherwise
&gt;  	serves no othr (sp) purpose. The virus sets a bit pattern in one
&gt;  	of the internal modem registers, but it seemed to screw up the
&gt;  	other registers on my USR. A modem that has been "infected" with
&gt;  	this virus will then transmit the virus to other modems that use a
&gt;  	subcarrier (I suppose those who use 300 and 1200 baud modems
&gt;  	should be immune). The virus then attaches itself to all binary
&gt;  	incoming data and infects the host computer's hard disk. The only
&gt;  	way to get rid of this virus is to completely reset all the modem
&gt;  	registers by hand, but I haven't found a way to vaccinate a modem
&gt;  	against the virus, but there is the possibility of building a
&gt;  	subcarrier filter. I am calling on a 1200 baud modem to enter this
&gt;  	message, and have advised the sysops of the two other boards
&gt;  	(names withheld). I don't know how this virus originated, but I'm
&gt;  	sure it is the work of someone in the computer telecommunications
&gt;  	field such as myself. Probably the best thing to do now is to
&gt;  	stick to 1200 baud until we figure this thing out.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Mike RoChenle
&gt; 
&gt; This bogus virus description spawned a humorous alert by Robert Morris III :
&gt; 
&gt;  	Date: 11-31-88 (24:60)	Number: 32769
&gt;  	To: ALL	Refer#: NONE
&gt;  	From: ROBERT MORRIS III	Read: (N/A)
&gt;  	Subj: VIRUS ALERT	Status: PUBLIC MESSAGE
&gt; 
&gt;  	Warning: There's a new virus on the loose that's worse than
&gt;  	anything I've seen before! It gets in through the power line,
&gt;  	riding on the powerline 60 Hz subcarrier. It works by changing the
&gt;  	serial port pinouts, and by reversing the direction one's disks
&gt;  	spin. Over 300,000 systems have been hit by it here in Murphy,
&gt;  	West Dakota alone! And that's just in the last 12 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; 	It attacks DOS, Unix, TOPS-20, Apple-II, VMS, MVS, Multics, Mac,
&gt;  	RSX-11, ITS, TRS-80, and VHS systems.
&gt; 
&gt;  	To prevent the spresd of the worm:
&gt; 
&gt;  	1) Don't use the powerline.
&gt;  	2) Don't use batteries either, since there are rumors that this
&gt;  	  virus has invaded most major battery plants and is infecting the
&gt;  	  positive poles of the batteries. (You might try hooking up just
&gt;  	  the negative pole.)
&gt;  	3) Don't upload or download files.
&gt;  	4) Don't store files on floppy disks or hard disks.
&gt;  	5) Don't read messages. Not even this one!
&gt;  	6) Don't use serial ports, modems, or phone lines.
&gt;  	7) Don't use keyboards, screens, or printers.
&gt;  	8) Don't use switches, CPUs, memories, microprocessors, or
&gt;  	  mainframes.
&gt;  	9) Don't use electric lights, electric or gas heat or
&gt;  	  airconditioning, running water, writing, fire, clothing or the
&gt;  	  wheel.
&gt; 
&gt;  	I'm sure if we are all careful to follow these 9 easy steps, this
&gt;  	virus can be eradicated, and the precious electronic flui9ds of
&gt;  	our computers can be kept pure.
&gt; 
&gt;  	---RTM III
&gt; 
&gt; Since that time virus hoaxes have flooded the Internet.With thousands of
&gt; viruses worldwide, virus paranoia in the community has risen to an extremely
&gt; high level. It is this paranoia that fuels virus hoaxes. A good example of
&gt; this behavior is the "Good Times" virus hoax which started in 1994 and is
&gt; still circulating the Internet today. Instead of spreading from one computer
&gt; to another by itself, Good Times relies on people to pass it along.
&gt; 
&gt; How to Identify a Hoax
&gt; ======================
&gt; 
&gt; There are several methods to identify virus hoaxes, but first consider what
&gt; makes a successful hoax on the Internet. There are two known factors that make
&gt; a successful virus hoax, they are: (1) technical sounding language, and
&gt; (2) credibility by association. If the warning uses the proper technical
&gt; jargon, most individuals, including technologically savy individuals, tend to
&gt; believe the warning is real. For example, the Good Times hoax says that
&gt; "...if the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed in
&gt; an nth-complexity infinite binary loop which can severely damage the
&gt; processor...". The first time you read this, it sounds like it might be
&gt; something real. With a little research, you find that there is no such thing
&gt; as an nth-complexity infinite binary loop and that processors are designed
&gt; to run loops for weeks at a time without damage.
&gt; 
&gt; When we say credibility by association we are referring to whom sent the
&gt; warning. If the janitor at a large technological organization sends a warning
&gt; to someone outside of that organization, people on the outside tend to believe
&gt; the warning because the company should know about those things. Even though
&gt; the person sending the warning may not have a clue what he is talking about,
&gt; the prestigue of the company backs the warning, making it appear real. If a
&gt; manager at the company sends the warning, the message is doubly backed by the
&gt; company's and the manager's reputations.
&gt; 
&gt; Individuals should also be especially alert if the warning urges you to pass
&gt; it on to your friends. This should raise a red flag that the warning may be
&gt; a hoax. Another flag to watch for is when the warning indicates that it is a
&gt; Federal Communication Commission (FCC) warning. According to the FCC, they
&gt; have not and never will disseminate warnings on viruses. It is not part of
&gt; their job.
&gt; 
&gt; CIAC recommends that you DO NOT circulate virus warnings without first
&gt; checking with an authoritative source. Authoritative sources are your computer
&gt; system security administrator or a computer incident advisory team. Real
&gt; warnings about viruses and other network problems are issued by different
&gt; response teams (CIAC, CERT, ASSIST, NASIRC, etc.) and are digitally signed by
&gt; the sending team using PGP. If you download a warning from a teams web site or
&gt; validate the PGP signature, you can usually be assured that the warning is
&gt; real. Warnings without the name of the person sending the original notice, or
&gt; warnings with names, addresses and phone numbers that do not actually exist
&gt; are probably hoaxes.
&gt; 
&gt; What to Do When You Receive a Warning
&gt; =====================================
&gt; 
&gt; Upon receiving a warning, you should examine its PGP signature to see that it
&gt; is from a real response team or antivirus organization. To do so, you will
&gt; need a copy of the PGP software and the public signature of the team that
&gt; sent the message. The CIAC signature is available from the CIAC web server
&gt; at:
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov">http://ciac.llnl.gov</A>
&gt; 
&gt; If there is no PGP signature, see if the warning includes the name of the
&gt; person submitting the original warning. Contact that person to see if he/she
&gt; really wrote the warning and if he/she really touched the virus. If he/she is
&gt; passing on a rumor or if the address of the person does not exist or if
&gt; there is any questions about theauthenticity or the warning, do not circulate
&gt; it to others. Instead, send the warning to your computer security manager or
&gt; incident response team and let them validate it. When in doubt, do not send
&gt; it out to the world. Your computer security managers and the incident response
&gt; teams teams have experts who try to stay current on viruses and their warnings.
&gt; In addition, most anti-virus companies have a web page containing information
&gt; about most known viruses and hoaxes. You can also call or check the web site
&gt; of the company that produces the product that is supposed to contain the virus.
&gt; Checking the PKWARE site for the current releases of PKZip would stop the
&gt; circulation of the warning about PKZ300 since there is no released version 3
&gt; of PKZip. Another useful web site is the "Computer Virus Myths home page"
&gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.kumite.com/myths/">http://www.kumite.com/myths/</A>) which contains descriptions of several known
&gt; hoaxes. In most cases, common sense would eliminate Internet hoaxes.
