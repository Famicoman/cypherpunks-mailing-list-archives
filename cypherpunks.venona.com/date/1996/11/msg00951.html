&gt; Instead of "Boris", Igor will substitute one of the 8 newsletter names; instead
&gt; of Adobe, he can use any volatile stock that's as likely to go up as down; and
&gt; the predicted stock price movement will be "up" in the first four newsletters
&gt; and "down" in the other four.
&gt; 
&gt; One month later the stock in question is either up or down. Without loss of
&gt; generality, suppose that it's gone down. Aleksej, Boris, Vasilij, and
&gt; Grigorij's investment advice was wrong, they disappear from the face of the
&gt; earth, and the former recipients of their newsletters don't get bothered any
&gt; more. (Or they could be recycled for future scams; or they could be send the
&gt; remaining 2 issues of worthless advice, as promised.) On the other hand
&gt; Dmitrij, Elena, Zhenja, and Zoya guessed right, so this time they send out a
&gt; new investment newsletter via the anonymous remailers:
&gt; 
&gt; "Congratulations! You continue to receive the free investment advice newsletter
&gt; from Zoya in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Last month I correctly predicted that Adobe will
&gt; have gone down. If you're smart, you've shorted Adobe's stock and made lots of
&gt; money by now. This month I predict that Cisco will go _down as well."
&gt; 
&gt; Again, Dmitrij and Elena predict that some other volatile stock goes up, while
&gt; Zhenja and Zoya predict that it goes down. Suppose D&amp;E are right. Igor leaves
&gt; the Zh.&amp;Z. partitions alone. One month later D&amp;E's subscribers get letter #3:
&gt; 
&gt; "Congratulations! You continue to receive the free investment advice newsletter
&gt; from Elena in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two months ago I predicted that Adobe would go
&gt; down. I hope you sold it short. Last month I predicted that Cisco would go up.
&gt; I hope you bought it. This month I predict that Lucent will go _up."
&gt; 
&gt; One month later one of the two is right, so its recipients get the fourth and
&gt; final e-mail from an anonymous remailer, this time using a reply block:
&gt; 
&gt; "I've given you three free stock tips over the last 3 months which probably
&gt; made you a lot of money. Now that you've seen my track record, you'll want to
&gt; continue receiving my free advice, but the free promotion is over. Please send
&gt; $20 in untraceable digital cash to this reply block to receive 6 future
&gt; issues."
&gt; 
&gt; Quite a few people would risk the $20, but that would be the last they hear
&gt; from Igor. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; (Alternatively, he can even e-mail 6 more issues of worthless advice to those
&gt; who caughed up the $20, so they can't complain. It would be hard to prosecute
&gt; Igor without proving that all 8 newsletters were published by the same person
&gt; who's been giving contradictory advice to different people.)

I can send all newsletters signed by myself, but claim that they are
produced by different numerical models for predicting (or derivatives')
returns. This way, even though I send out contradictory advice, I
could always say that I had several experimental programs.

It seems though that the market for advise newsletter has been saturated
by people who give random advices and hope to hit a jackpot, like
Garzarelli did with her "sell" advice before the '87 crash.

So my letters would be hardly noticed.

	- Igor.
