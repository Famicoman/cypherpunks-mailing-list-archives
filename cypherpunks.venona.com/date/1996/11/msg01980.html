&gt; &gt;I believe that at this time the differential market value to customers of

&gt;
&gt; I generally agree with Tim about consumers.  However, I remember working on
&gt; a theater production where we were using Radio Shack 2-way headphones for
&gt; communication.  One day while we were setting up, we were able to overhear
&gt; a woman discussing (presumably with a girlfriend) her boyfriend and their
&gt; sex life over a portable telephone.  You can bet that every available
&gt; headset was in use and all other work stopped.

So - get a scanner (which may be illegal), put a horny kid to transcribe
whatever you hear, and post it to usenet via the anonymous remailers.

That'll catch the media's attention.

&gt; Where I think there is a market and an awareness of a need is in the
&gt; corporate world.  I recently saw a corporate security policy which
&gt; specifically restricted discussing classified information on portable or
&gt; cell phones.  If I were in France (to pick on just one guilty country), I
&gt; would not want to discuss secrets involving competitive position vs. a
&gt; French company on a landline connection.  The big driving force for
&gt; companies is how much the facility costs.  (I recently heard a price of
&gt; $700 for non-crypto phones.)  If the cost is low enough, company employees
&gt; will have these boxes in their homes.
&gt;
&gt; The other big obstacle is standards.  As far as I can tell, every crypto
&gt; phone has its own protocol.  If there were a standard set of protocols, it
&gt; would greatly help the market, as it has for so many other products.  As a
&gt; first step, I suggest that Eric Blossom and PGP Inc. work together to
&gt; develop a mode where their products can communicate with each other.

I've been on the Internet for close to 15 years. I used to tell people how
wonderful it is and how they should use it at least for e-mail. And they'd
say to me, most of the people they want to talk to either don't use e-mail
or are on systems not connected to the Internet back then, like Compuserve.
And they were right at that time.
