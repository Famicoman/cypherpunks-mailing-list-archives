&gt; Well, in the judge's defense, note that he used the word "perhaps" above. I 
&gt; like this judge, which (obviously) isn't something I can say about too many 
&gt; judges...I think he was just trying to sharpen our thoughts and arguments, 
&gt; and that he DOES agree with us on many, many things. His fears about the 
&gt; misuse of anonymity in a police state, for example, come from his personal 
&gt; experience in a former socialist paradise. I think (hope) that being exposed 
&gt; to "cypherpunk issues" by as many good thinkers as he was, in a relaxed, 
&gt; non-courtroom setting, has broadened his understanding of the many issues 
&gt; involved and will help "our" side immensely if these same issues ever do 
&gt; come before him.

Jim,

Thank you for doing this.  I went to Law School to bring a viewpoint 
to the bench that was never there.  I do so whenever I can.  What you 
are doing is a very important part of moving this country forward.  I 
understand the people who [RANT] about the problems we face, but when 
people like you hold a civil discourse with officials we overcome the 
label of extremists.

&gt; 
&gt; I have decided, however, to cease my very enjoyable conversation with him 
&gt; about these issues, from now until after Judge Patel's Bernstein case has 
&gt; been decided and appealed, because of this very possibility. I am already 
&gt; concerned that an ambitious U.S. Attorney, using Alta Vista, could attempt 
&gt; to argue that "cypherpunk terrorists have been secretly trying to subtly 
&gt; influence Kozinski's thinking, and that therefore he should be removed from 
&gt; the case in favor of some judge who has no clue whatsoever about the 'Net, 
&gt; encryption, anonymous remailers, etc." [I am sure the argument wouldn't be 
&gt; put quite that way &lt;g&gt; but that's what the U.S. Attorney would mean.] There 
&gt; is now a judge with some idea of these issues who will IMNSHO probably be 
&gt; fair to "our" side. It is a rare opportunity, and I don't want to "blow it."

Once again, thank you for all you are doing.
