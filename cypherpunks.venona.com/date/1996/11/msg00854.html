Seen on usenet. I'm not currently subscibing to the list, so I hope it's
not old news.

Can You KEEP a SECRET?

Doctor? Lawyer? Accountant? Executive? Or even Politician? -- you know
there is some information your clients don't want to fall into public
hands. Can you
keep a secret? They want you to. Let's face it, you want to keep some
things a secret as much as they do!

Now you can. Now there is an unbreakable version of ENIGMA which is so
easy to use that a child can send messages the CIA can't break.

Perhaps you remember the original version of ENIGMA used so successfully
by the Germans during World War II. Hundreds of cryptologists worked for
thousands of
hours to unscramble the secret orders being flashed openly over the air
waves by the Germans. In the end, allies cracked the code only by
stealing one of the machines.

With ULTRA ENIGMA 2.0 stealing the machine won't do your enemies any
good at all. First, the New ENIGMA is a thousand times more complex. Yet
it only takes a matter of minutes for you to lock up whole directories
of your secret files securely. Then your secrets are safe. They are
secure, Now and Forever.

Your secrets are safe because there is no place for cryptologists to
begin, no way they can tell which part of the code is part of the secret
and which part is garbage, no way of telling if the file is long, or
short, or a drawing, or a picture, and it might even be in a foreign
language for all they know. Yes, the new ENIGMA really can encode
drawings, pictures, X-Rays and absolutely anything else you can put into
a computer. Can You keep a Secret? With ENIGMA you can... ENIGMA is so
secure that not even the producers can crack your secrets open.

ENIGMA is seamless. Nobody can crack the codes you set but you. Now
that's a Secret you can tell everybody! Your clients will be glad to
hear it, and you'll
sleep better knowing it is true.

Let us spill out the Secret Details of ENIGMA for you to examine. Take
just a moment to glance through our pages. We'll show you how it works,
and explain why it works. Then,
especially for Governments and other high risk situations,, we reveal
why even the weak link, (knowing the encoder) can be eliminated with a
Fortune Cookie blindly selected from a randomly available jar with
thousands of cookies shuffled back and forth at the company. Think about
it;, if YOU don't pick the keys, how can ANYONE guess which keys You
Pick? And we are sorry, but NO... the company won't have any idea which
keys you pick either..! -- Think of it this way, some things are best
kept a secret between you and you. As an added bonus, we'll also show
you some other professional ways you can guard your secrets.
