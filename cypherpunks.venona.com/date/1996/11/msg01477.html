Eric Hughes gave a two-part presentation at DEFCON IV, which he has
subsequently polished up, that addresses: 1. ways to implement a Universal
Priacy System that enables simple and anonymous data hiding using the
existing Net facilites, and 2. a system of intellectual property
distribution and funding which is based more closely on models used in
Hollywood (e.g., completion bonds).

Eric, what's the status of your proposal?

-- Steve

&gt;Here we go again:
&gt;
&gt;      There are is a lot of software that we would all like to see
&gt;developed and deployed right?
&gt;
&gt;      There are a lot of people out there who write code, sometimes
&gt;even freely redistributable code, but they have to eat, and get their
&gt;net access right?
&gt;
&gt;     Well, I was thinking, what if a "Crypto Software Bounty Server"
&gt;were set up, so that someone could propose a tool that they would like
&gt;to see, along with an initial bounty. Others could contribute toward that
&gt;bounty (anonymously if they wish) until either the tool was delivered.
&gt;
&gt;     The original issuer sets standards for the software (i.e. "easy to
&gt;use interface to mixmaster remailers for Macintosh", then must define
&gt;easy to use; Software considered delivered when in [alpha beta late-beta
&gt;&amp;etc.]). The first to present software meeting these qualifications gets
&gt;the bounty, with the caviate that the software must be either gnu-copylefted,
&gt;or some similar "free use" copyright, after all, "The Net" paid for it...
&gt;
&gt;     Some of the problems (and potential solutions) I can think of in this:
&gt;
&gt;     1) Refusing to honor the contract--Maybe when a project is proposed,
&gt;        some other people (for a small percentage of the total) sign on
&gt;        as judges. When they feel that it reached the stated goal, then
&gt;        it is done. -Or- Money put up is non-refundable, and the bounty
&gt;        stays in the "bank" until claimed.
&gt;
&gt;     2) If the money stays in the bank until claimed, people might not
&gt;        put up that much (or enough) to make a specific project worthwile--
&gt;
&gt;        This could be solved by allowing the "bounty" to lapse in one
&gt;        of 3 ways:
&gt;
&gt;        A) &lt;x&gt; length of time after the initial proposal (bad because
&gt;           i) someone could already be working on it; ii) bad because
&gt;           other people might add to the bounty, so a potential programmer
&gt;           might not start until the "pot" has grown to a certain level.
&gt;
&gt;        B) &lt;x&gt; length of time after the last addition to the bounty,
&gt;           bad for both i &amp; ii above.
&gt;
&gt;           These can both be gotten around (and other problems) by allowing
&gt;           programmers to "register" with the service that they are working
&gt;           on a project (either anonymous registery, so that people will
&gt;           still contribute to the project, or list those registered so
&gt;           that people know [if who] someone is working on it)
&gt;
&gt;     3) Funding: The server (in both the machine and the organizational sense)
&gt;        could be funded by:
&gt;
&gt;        A) Interest on the money accumulated.
&gt;
&gt;        B) A percentage of the bounty (say 10%)
&gt;
&gt;        C) Both A &amp; B.
&gt;
&gt;Has anything like this been proposed before? I know that the FSF (IIRC) accepts
&gt;contributions, but I am thinking of something more targeted, more "market
&gt;driven" if you will.
&gt;
&gt;This could be expanded to non-crypto software as well, just think, if half
&gt;the X Window users ponied up $5 a peice for a "good, easy to use non-motif
&gt;word processor", how long do you think it would take for someone to start
&gt;coding a MS Word killer?
&gt;
&gt;Comments?
