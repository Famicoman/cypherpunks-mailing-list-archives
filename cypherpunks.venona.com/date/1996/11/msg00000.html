                      SEARCH ENGINE SECRETS
                        

                 HOW YOU CAN GET YOUR SITE CONSISTENTLY 
                          IN THE TOP 10
                      ON MAJOR SEARCH ENGINES
                (and watch your hit count skyrocket)

                                             
                 <A  HREF="http://www.servicebrokers.com/SES3.htm">http://www.servicebrokers.com/SES3.htm</A>



As you probably noticed with the listing of your site on the search engines,
it is becoming more and more difficult to be found among the MILLIONS of
listings.  

If you"re like the rest of us you have found it extremely frustrating. You
spend lots of time and money developing your site and then you're listed
number 30, or 80, or even 200th.  You're NEVER FOUND.


                    ***************************
                            GOOD NEWS


The good news is we have found a SOLUTION. After months of fighting the
search engine battle we got LUCKY. 

A programmer recently became associated with our firm who had done some
CONSULTING WORK for six months with one of the major search engines. With
his help we developed a REPORT on the major search engines and how they
really work.
 

                   *****************************
REPORT 

His report is excellent. We have been using the material in the report for
over five months. IT WORKS!  With it, our sites are in the top TEN listings
on all major search engines and we have experienced a virtual stampede of
people to the web sites.  

                     
HITS ARE UP, SALES ARE UP, and most importantly, everyone is HAPPY.

&gt;
&gt;                    ***************************
                            YOUR COPY
