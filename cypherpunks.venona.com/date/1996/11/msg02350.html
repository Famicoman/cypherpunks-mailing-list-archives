&gt; Our friend Don Woods seems to have inadvertently sparked what could be a

Not only that But I have proven that the IPG system is perfect, see the
proof at:

           <A  HREF="http://www.netprivacy.com">http://www.netprivacy.com</A>

And you can prove it to yourself, it is patently self evident iwhen you
examine the algorithm and uinderstand what it does.Need I say more.
Find out yourself.

Your friend,

Don Wood

&gt; Not to be confused with the usual "unbreakable" snake oil we see peddled 
&gt; so often, I refer to systems for which rigorous mathematical proof that 
&gt; "there are no shortcuts" exists.  To my knowledge, no such systems, with 
&gt; the exception of a real one-time pad, exist today.  However, I also 
&gt; under the impression that ongoing research on this topic continues.  For 
&gt; example, consider the work being done on "Lattice" cryptosystems (see 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://jya.com/lattice.htm">http://jya.com/lattice.htm</A>).
&gt; 
&gt; "diGriz" is right.  Nothing precludes the existence of a cryptographic 
&gt; algorithm for which a rigorous mathematical proof of "security" exists
&gt; --- where "security" means a provable lower bound on the time required 
&gt; for recovery of the key.  Indeed, it seems that finding such an 
&gt; algorithm --- or providing the necessary rigorous proof for a current 
&gt; algorithm --- is a laudable goal of academic cryptographic research.
&gt; 
&gt; Rigorous proofs of the non-existence of an algorithm are not new.  
&gt; Neither are rigorous proofs that any algorithm which can solve a given 
&gt; problem requires a minimal running time.  Or, in an even stronger sense, 
&gt; that a particular known algorithm for a given problem is indeed a 
&gt; (provably) optimal algorithm for that problem.
&gt; 
&gt; For a (non-cryptographic) example of a proof of the first sort --- that 
&gt; is, that "there exists no algorithm" --- consider the famous "Halting 
&gt; Problem" for Turing machines.  (I believe someone else has also 
&gt; mentioned this.)  There are many proofs such as this one, often related, 
&gt; though the Halting Problem itself is perhaps the most famous example.
&gt; 
&gt; For an (again, non-cryptographic) example of a proof of the second sort 
&gt; --- that is, that "any algorithm that solves a given problem requires a 
&gt; minimal running time" --- consider the proof that the "minimal" number 
&gt; of key comparisons in the worst case required to sort a random list of 
&gt; elements for which only an ordering relationship is known is O(nlog(n)).  
&gt; See Knuth, Volume 3, section 5.3.  For a simpler example, a standard 
&gt; "binary" search which requires O(log(n)) comparisons to find a given 
&gt; element in the worst case is provably the optimal algorithm for this 
&gt; task.
&gt; 
&gt; Turning once again to cryptography, there is presumably an "optimal" 
&gt; algorithm for factoring a "general" number in the "worst" case.  Of 
&gt; course, known algorithms for factorization seem to regularly improve and 
&gt; no one has even suggested that any current algorithm is (provably) the 
&gt; "optimal" algorithm.  Worse case bounds on running time for currently 
&gt; known algorithms can certainly be produced, but no one currently knows 
&gt; if these are the best algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; However, just as one can say, "How do you know that tomorrow some 
&gt; brilliant mathematician will not produce a polynomial time factorization 
&gt; algorithm?" one can also say, "How do you know that tomorrow some 
&gt; brilliant mathematician will not provide a rigorous proof that all 
&gt; factorization algorithms --- in the worse case --- require some 
&gt; specified minimal running time?"
&gt; 
&gt; While the current state of mathematical knowledge suggests that this is 
&gt; not likely to happen anytime soon for the factorization problem, it is 
&gt; encouraging to see work in areas where more rigorous proofs of security 
&gt; are within closer reach.  Again, I refer to work on Lattice problems.  
&gt; If the types of rigorous proof regarding "what can't be done" that are 
&gt; known for the Halting Problem, sorting, and searching are available for 
&gt; cryptographic problems, then this is indeed a major (and laudable) 
&gt; advance in cryptography.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, discussion on this topic is unrelated to such security 
&gt; problems as implementation mistakes, fault analysis, outright theft of 
&gt; keys, etc.  I hope that I've been careful to explain what I mean by 
&gt; "provably secure" and that it's not interpreted to include these types 
&gt; of attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm interested in the current state of research (if any) on this topic.  
&gt; Other than what John Young sent to the list some time ago about Lattice 
&gt; stuff --- which is certainly far from prime time --- I've not seen 
&gt; anything else.  I also haven't devoted a lot of time to looking.
&gt; 
&gt; Relevant pieces of the earlier thread are included below.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments, anyone?

&gt; &gt; No, you can't.  It's impossible to prove an algorithim unbreakable.
&gt; &gt; You can only say that it hasn't been broken yet, but you can't
&gt; &gt; predict the advances in cryptoanalysis.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If, in two or three years, no one's broken it then maybe it'll seem
&gt; &gt; like a reasonably-secure algorithim.  Of course when someone does break
&gt; &gt; it you'll just say "oh, that wasn't the real algorithim" like you did
&gt; &gt; last time.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can't prove a negative.  The best IPG could say is that
&gt; &gt; it can't be broken with current technology.
&gt; &gt; Next week someone might come up with a new way
&gt; &gt; to break ciphers that renders the IPG algorithim breakable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You point could have been that the same problem exists
&gt; &gt; for proofs- that next week someone could come up
&gt; &gt; with a way to prove, for all time, that an algorithim
&gt; &gt; really IS unbreakable.  So, to cover that posibility
&gt; &gt; I should have said "it's currently impossible to
&gt; &gt; prove an algorithim unbreakable". :-)

&gt; &gt; It is impossible to prove such a thing.  It's like saying you have proof
&gt; &gt; that you have the last car of a certain model ever to be built.  Anybody
&gt; &gt; could come along and build another, and then you don't have the last one.

&gt; &gt; There *IS NO SUCH PROOF*.  Just like you can't prove that god created the
&gt; &gt; universe, or that Oswald shot Kennedy, and so on and so forth.  It can't
&gt; &gt; be proven.  It never has been proven, and it never will be proven.  People
&gt; &gt; have new ideas, new algorithms are invented.  Someday, somebody will crack
&gt; &gt; _all_ the cryptosystems that have now been invented.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Please prove your assertion.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you can't prove this, and you can't find anybody else who has, why
&gt; &gt; &gt; should we believe it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Prove it?  Thats like saying "prove that the sun is bright on a sunny
&gt; &gt; day".  Its completely obvious.  If somebody has a new idea on how to
&gt; &gt; attack their algorithm, it might work.  Then the system will have been
&gt; &gt; broken.  You never know when somebody will come up with a new idea, so the
&gt; &gt; best you can truthfully say is "it hasn't been broken *YET*".  As I
&gt; &gt; remember, this was mentioned in more than one respected crypto book,
&gt; &gt; including "Applied Cryptography" (Schneier).

&gt; &gt; Page number?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps it would be helpful to hear a possible proof.  If somebody
&gt; &gt; were to show that breaking a certain cryptographic algorithm was
&gt; &gt; NP-complete, many people would find this almost as good as proof that
&gt; &gt; the algorithm is unbreakable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then if a clever person were to show that the NP-complete problems
&gt; &gt; were not solvable in any faster way than we presently know how, you
&gt; &gt; would have proof that a cryptographic algorithm was unbreakable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is no obvious reason why such a proof is not possible.
