&gt;&gt; The average welfare benefit (including food stamps, medicaid, and all the

&gt;&gt; Offer most welfare recipients a minimum wage job and they will laugh in your
&gt;&gt; face.  (In fact, here in Michigan most employers are already paying several
&gt;&gt; $$ above minimum wage, and often these jobs are unfilled).
&gt;
&gt;I am not in a position to argue with you, I simply don't have the facts.
&gt;My question is, do You? can you cite where this figure came from, it
&gt;sounds like Republican rhetoric to me. Of course, I will point out, that
&gt;minimum wage is simply not enough to feed a family. It is (or at least
&gt;it should be) reserved for single folks just starting out.

Can't give you the exact date, but it was an article in our local paper (The
Detroit News).  The $10 figure is not exact, as the actual number varies
from state to state, I remember that number as being about average.
 
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; More bullshit.  You don't know what anyones motives are.  To ascribe your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; motivations to Bill Gates is unrealistic.  
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;But you claim to know the motives of those on welfare: pot-&gt;kettle-&gt;black
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I don't claim to know the motives.  I am examining empirical evidence.  As
&gt;
&gt;Sure you do: "economic decision to do nothing and go on welfare vs.
&gt;going to work". It seems to me that you are claiming their motives are
&gt;econmic, is there some other way we should read that sentence?

You got me there :-)

&gt;It takes an awful lot to prove a causal relationship, empirical evidence
&gt;notwithstanding. You haven't made your case, as far as I am concerned
&gt;(not that you need to convince me), there are a myriad of other factors
&gt;involved. I have no doubt that given two (or three) poor choices, most
&gt;will choose the lesser evil and that *may* mean choosing welfare over
&gt;working, but I seriously doubt that this is anything but a small
&gt;minority of the cases of people who are actually using the system.
&gt;
&gt;You suggest that what ought to be done is give less welfare. If your
&gt;thesis is correct, I suggest that better paying jobs is the real answer
&gt;(assuming you agree that minimum wage is too little for most to live
&gt;on). Shrinking welfare payouts may serve to get people off welfare but
&gt;it won't make it any easier to live on low wages. We DO have a duty to
&gt;help our neighbours, do we not? Or has greed taken over entirely?

I don't mind helping my neighbors.  Of course, they live next door and I
know them!  The problem is that the welfare creates a system where behaviour
that is generally bad for society is subsidized.  The incentives are all
wrong.  And no, I don't think the minimum wage should be increased either.
Increasing the minimum wage at a time when you are pushing people off of
welfare is the wrong action, because it decreases the number of jobs
available.
