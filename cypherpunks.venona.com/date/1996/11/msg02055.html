Internet Hoaxes: PKZ300, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda, Ghost<BR>
<BR>
November 20, 1996 15:00 GMT                                        Number H-05<BR>
______________________________________________________________________________<BR>
PROBLEM:       This bulletin addresses the following hoaxes and erroneous<BR>
warnings: PKZ300 Warning, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda, and<BR>
Ghost.exe<BR>
PLATFORM:      All, via e-mail<BR>
DAMAGE:        Time lost reading and responding to the messages<BR>
SOLUTION:      Pass unvalidated warnings only to your computer security<BR>
department or incident response team. See below on how to<BR>
recognize validated and unvalidated warnings and hoaxes.<BR>
______________________________________________________________________________<BR>
VULNERABILITY  New hoaxes and warnings have appeared on the Internet and old<BR>
ASSESSMENT:    hoaxes are still being cirulated.<BR>
______________________________________________________________________________<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Introduction<BR>
============<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer<BR>
viruses and Trojans. However, interspersed among real virus notices are<BR>
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are<BR>
still time consuming and costly to handle. At CIAC, we find that we are<BR>
spending much more time de-bunking hoaxes than handling real virus incidents.<BR>
This advisory addresses the most recent warnings that have appeared on the<BR>
Internet and are being circulated throughout world today. We will also address<BR>
the history behind virus hoaxes, how to identify a hoax, and what to do if you<BR>
think a message is or is not a hoax. Users are requested to please not spread<BR>
unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojans. If you receive an unvalidated<BR>
warning, don't pass it to all your friends, pass it to your computer security<BR>
manager to validate first. Validated warnings from the incident response teams<BR>
and antivirus vendors have valid return addresses and are usually PGP signed<BR>
with the organization's key.<BR>
<BR>
PKZ300 Warning<BR>
==============<BR>
<BR>
The PKZ300 Trojan is a real Trojan program, but the initial warning about it<BR>
was released over a year ago. For information pertaining to PKZ300 Trojan<BR>
reference CIAC Notes issue 95-10, that was released in June of 1995.<BR>
<BR>
http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml<BR>
<BR>
The warning itself, on the other hand, is gaining urban legend status. There<BR>
has been an extremely limited number of sightings of this Trojan and those<BR>
appeared over a year ago. Even though the Trojan warning is real, the repeated<BR>
circulation of the warning is a nuisance. Individuals who need the current<BR>
release of  PKZIP should visit the PKWARE web page at http://www.pkware.com.<BR>
CIAC recommends that you DO NOT recirculate the warning about this particular<BR>
Trojan.<BR>
<BR>
Irina Virus Hoax<BR>
================<BR>
<BR>
The "Irina" virus warnings are a hoax. The former head of an electronic<BR>
publishing company circulated the warning to create publicity for a new<BR>
interactive book by the same name. The publishing company has apologized for<BR>
the publicity stunt that backfired and panicked Internet users worldwide. The<BR>
original warning claimed to be from a Professor Edward Pridedaux of the<BR>
College of Slavic Studies in London; there is no such person or college.<BR>
However, London's School of  Slavonic and East European Studies has been<BR>
inundated with calls. This poorly thought-out publicity stunt was highly<BR>
irresponsible. For more information pertaining to this hoax, reference the<BR>
UK Daily Telegraph at http://www.telegraph.co.uk.<BR>
<BR>
Good Times Virus Hoax<BR>
=====================<BR>
<BR>
The "Good Times" virus warnings are a hoax. There is no virus by that name in<BR>
existence today. These warnings have been circulating the Internet for years.<BR>
The user community must become aware that it is unlikely that a virus can be<BR>
constructed to behave in the manner ascribed in the "Good Times" virus<BR>
warning. For more information related to this urban legend, reference CIAC<BR>
Notes 95-09.<BR>
<BR>
http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml<BR>
<BR>
Deeyenda Virus Hoax<BR>
===================<BR>
<BR>
The "Deeyenda" virus warnings are a hoax. CIAC has received inqueries<BR>
regarding the validity of the Deeyenda virus. The warnings are very similar<BR>
to those for Good Times, stating that the FCC issued a warning about it,<BR>
and that it is self activating and can destroy the contents of a machine<BR>
just by being downloaded. Users should note that the FCC does not and will<BR>
not issue virus or Trojan warnings. It is not their job to do so. As of this<BR>
date, there are no known viruses with the name Deeyenda in existence. For a<BR>
virus to spread, it  must be executed. Reading a mail message does not execute<BR>
the mail message. Trojans and viruses have been found as executable attachments<BR>
to mail messages, but they must be extracted and executed to do any harm. CIAC<BR>
still affirms that reading E-mail, using typical mail agents, can not activate<BR>
malicious code delivered in or with the message.<BR>
<BR>
Ghost.exe Warning<BR>
=================<BR>
<BR>
The Ghost.exe program was originally distributed as a free screen saver<BR>
containing some advertising information for the author's company (Access<BR>
Softek). The program opens a window that shows a Halloween background with<BR>
ghosts flying around the screen. On any Friday the 13th, the program window<BR>
title changes and the ghosts fly off the window and around the screen. Someone<BR>
apparently got worried and sent a message indicating that this might be a<BR>
Trojan. The warning grew until the it said that Ghost.exe was a Trojan that<BR>
would destroy your hard drive and the developers got a lot of nasty phone<BR>
calls (their names and phone numbers were in the About box of the program.)<BR>
A simple phone call to the number listed in the program would have stopped<BR>
this warning from being sent out. The original ghost.exe program is just cute;<BR>
it does not do anything damaging. Note that this does not mean that ghost<BR>
could not be infected with a virus that does do damage, so the normal<BR>
antivirus procedure of scanning it before running it should be followed.<BR>
<BR>
History of Virus Hoaxes<BR>
=======================<BR>
<BR>
Since 1988, computer virus hoaxes have been circulating the Internet. In<BR>
October of that year, according to Ferbrache ("A pathology of Computer<BR>
Viruses" Springer, London, 1992) one of the first virus hoaxes was the<BR>
2400 baud modem virus:<BR>
<BR>
SUBJ: Really Nasty Virus<BR>
AREA: GENERAL (1)<BR>
<BR>
I've just discovered probably the world's worst computer virus<BR>
yet. I had just finished a late night session of BBS'ing and file<BR>
treading when I exited Telix 3 and attempted to run pkxarc to<BR>
unarc the software I had downloaded. Next thing I knew my hard<BR>
disk was seeking all over and it was apparently writing random<BR>
sectors. Thank god for strong coffee and a recent backup.<BR>
Everything was back to normal, so I called the BBS again and<BR>
downloaded a file. When I went to use ddir to list the directory,<BR>
my hard disk was getting trashed again. I tried Procomm Plus TD<BR>
and also PC Talk 3. Same results every time. Something was up so I<BR>
hooked up to my test equipment and different modems (I do research<BR>
and development for a local computer telecommunications company<BR>
and have an in-house lab at my disposal). After another hour of<BR>
corrupted hard drives I found what I think is the world's worst<BR>
computer virus yet. The virus distributes itself on the modem sub-<BR>
carrier present in all 2400 baud and up modems. The sub-carrier is<BR>
used for ROM and register debugging purposes only, and otherwise<BR>
serves no othr (sp) purpose. The virus sets a bit pattern in one<BR>
of the internal modem registers, but it seemed to screw up the<BR>
other registers on my USR. A modem that has been "infected" with<BR>
this virus will then transmit the virus to other modems that use a<BR>
subcarrier (I suppose those who use 300 and 1200 baud modems<BR>
should be immune). The virus then attaches itself to all binary<BR>
incoming data and infects the host computer's hard disk. The only<BR>
way to get rid of this virus is to completely reset all the modem<BR>
registers by hand, but I haven't found a way to vaccinate a modem<BR>
against the virus, but there is the possibility of building a<BR>
subcarrier filter. I am calling on a 1200 baud modem to enter this<BR>
message, and have advised the sysops of the two other boards<BR>
(names withheld). I don't know how this virus originated, but I'm<BR>
sure it is the work of someone in the computer telecommunications<BR>
field such as myself. Probably the best thing to do now is to<BR>
stick to 1200 baud until we figure this thing out.<BR>

This bogus virus description spawned a humorous alert by Robert Morris III :<BR>
<BR>
Date: 11-31-88 (24:60)	Number: 32769<BR>
To: ALL	Refer#: NONE<BR>
From: ROBERT MORRIS III	Read: (N/A)<BR>
Subj: VIRUS ALERT	Status: PUBLIC MESSAGE<BR>
<BR>
Warning: There's a new virus on the loose that's worse than<BR>
anything I've seen before! It gets in through the power line,<BR>
riding on the powerline 60 Hz subcarrier. It works by changing the<BR>
serial port pinouts, and by reversing the direction one's disks<BR>
spin. Over 300,000 systems have been hit by it here in Murphy,<BR>
West Dakota alone! And that's just in the last 12 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
It attacks DOS, Unix, TOPS-20, Apple-II, VMS, MVS, Multics, Mac,<BR>
RSX-11, ITS, TRS-80, and VHS systems.<BR>
<BR>
To prevent the spresd of the worm:<BR>
<BR>
1) Don't use the powerline.<BR>
2) Don't use batteries either, since there are rumors that this<BR>
virus has invaded most major battery plants and is infecting the<BR>
positive poles of the batteries. (You might try hooking up just<BR>
the negative pole.)<BR>
3) Don't upload or download files.<BR>
4) Don't store files on floppy disks or hard disks.<BR>
5) Don't read messages. Not even this one!<BR>
6) Don't use serial ports, modems, or phone lines.<BR>
7) Don't use keyboards, screens, or printers.<BR>
8) Don't use switches, CPUs, memories, microprocessors, or<BR>
mainframes.<BR>
9) Don't use electric lights, electric or gas heat or<BR>
airconditioning, running water, writing, fire, clothing or the<BR>
wheel.<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure if we are all careful to follow these 9 easy steps, this<BR>
virus can be eradicated, and the precious electronic flui9ds of<BR>
our computers can be kept pure.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Since that time virus hoaxes have flooded the Internet.With thousands of<BR>
viruses worldwide, virus paranoia in the community has risen to an extremely<BR>
high level. It is this paranoia that fuels virus hoaxes. A good example of<BR>
this behavior is the "Good Times" virus hoax which started in 1994 and is<BR>
still circulating the Internet today. Instead of spreading from one computer<BR>
to another by itself, Good Times relies on people to pass it along.<BR>
<BR>
How to Identify a Hoax<BR>
======================<BR>
<BR>
There are several methods to identify virus hoaxes, but first consider what<BR>
makes a successful hoax on the Internet. There are two known factors that make<BR>
a successful virus hoax, they are: (1) technical sounding language, and<BR>
(2) credibility by association. If the warning uses the proper technical<BR>
jargon, most individuals, including technologically savy individuals, tend to<BR>
believe the warning is real. For example, the Good Times hoax says that<BR>
"...if the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed in<BR>
an nth-complexity infinite binary loop which can severely damage the<BR>
processor...". The first time you read this, it sounds like it might be<BR>
something real. With a little research, you find that there is no such thing<BR>
as an nth-complexity infinite binary loop and that processors are designed<BR>
to run loops for weeks at a time without damage.<BR>
<BR>
When we say credibility by association we are referring to whom sent the<BR>
warning. If the janitor at a large technological organization sends a warning<BR>
to someone outside of that organization, people on the outside tend to believe<BR>
the warning because the company should know about those things. Even though<BR>
the person sending the warning may not have a clue what he is talking about,<BR>
the prestigue of the company backs the warning, making it appear real. If a<BR>
manager at the company sends the warning, the message is doubly backed by the<BR>
company's and the manager's reputations.<BR>
<BR>
Individuals should also be especially alert if the warning urges you to pass<BR>
it on to your friends. This should raise a red flag that the warning may be<BR>
a hoax. Another flag to watch for is when the warning indicates that it is a<BR>
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) warning. According to the FCC, they<BR>
have not and never will disseminate warnings on viruses. It is not part of<BR>
their job.<BR>
<BR>
CIAC recommends that you DO NOT circulate virus warnings without first<BR>
checking with an authoritative source. Authoritative sources are your computer<BR>
system security administrator or a computer incident advisory team. Real<BR>
warnings about viruses and other network problems are issued by different<BR>
response teams (CIAC, CERT, ASSIST, NASIRC, etc.) and are digitally signed by<BR>
the sending team using PGP. If you download a warning from a teams web site or<BR>
validate the PGP signature, you can usually be assured that the warning is<BR>
real. Warnings without the name of the person sending the original notice, or<BR>
warnings with names, addresses and phone numbers that do not actually exist<BR>
are probably hoaxes.<BR>
<BR>
What to Do When You Receive a Warning<BR>
=====================================<BR>
<BR>
Upon receiving a warning, you should examine its PGP signature to see that it<BR>
is from a real response team or antivirus organization. To do so, you will<BR>
need a copy of the PGP software and the public signature of the team that<BR>
sent the message. The CIAC signature is available from the CIAC web server<BR>
at:<BR>
<BR>
http://ciac.llnl.gov<BR>
<BR>
If there is no PGP signature, see if the warning includes the name of the<BR>
person submitting the original warning. Contact that person to see if he/she<BR>
really wrote the warning and if he/she really touched the virus. If he/she is<BR>
passing on a rumor or if the address of the person does not exist or if<BR>
there is any questions about theauthenticity or the warning, do not circulate<BR>
it to others. Instead, send the warning to your computer security manager or<BR>
incident response team and let them validate it. When in doubt, do not send<BR>
it out to the world. Your computer security managers and the incident response<BR>
teams teams have experts who try to stay current on viruses and their warnings.<BR>
In addition, most anti-virus companies have a web page containing information<BR>
about most known viruses and hoaxes. You can also call or check the web site<BR>
of the company that produces the product that is supposed to contain the virus.<BR>
Checking the PKWARE site for the current releases of PKZip would stop the<BR>
circulation of the warning about PKZ300 since there is no released version 3<BR>
of PKZip. Another useful web site is the "Computer Virus Myths home page"<BR>
(http://www.kumite.com/myths/) which contains descriptions of several known<BR>
hoaxes. In most cases, common sense would eliminate Internet hoaxes.<BR>
