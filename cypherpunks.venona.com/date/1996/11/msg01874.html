&gt;On the issue of why many of us don't read as much SF as we once did...

&gt;1. I'm a lot older. The stuff that I thought was really great back when I
&gt;was 14-22, or so, and even "pretty good" until I was about 25 or so, now
&gt;really looks like dreck. (Not all of it, but more than I thought was dreck
&gt;at the time.)

&gt;Partly this is age and life experience, partly just increased sophistication.

Remember Sturgen's (sp?) law: 90% of everything is crap -  I think most of
us just take awhile before we agree.  The SF genre could be characterized by
a couple diamonds buried in a manure pit...

&gt;(Vernor V. claimed to a friend of mine that the day he spent talking to
&gt;several of us was the most fruitful day he'd spent in a long time...I take
&gt;this as evidence that folks like us are to the new generation of SF writers
&gt;what folks like members of the British Interplanetary Society were to
&gt;writers of past generations.)

I'd agree 100%.  A community as small as the SF writers *needs* outside
influence.  Must be neat, though, to read a book and go "I *did* that!"

&gt;(Interestingly, Eric Drexler says he cannot enjoy it because Simmons does
&gt;not give nanotechnology a central enough role. This echoes the point Duncan

nanotech (and other things) can spoil a good story by making things too
easy.  Take most (all?) of Forward's books - great ideas, but it reads like
a press release.

&gt;- Orson Scott Card, "Ender's Game." A good fictional exploration of online
&gt;anony mity. In many ways, Cypherpunks was explicity a kind of combination
&gt;of "Ender's Game," "True Names," "The Shockwave Rider," and "Atlas
&gt;Shrugged."

I think those books are partly responsible for getting a great many people
interested in this sort of thing...

&gt;- and of course Heinlein, though his best stuff is 30-45 years old now

Always a mark of a great SF author: his stuff is still good even if the
science is outdated...   Ditto EE smith - it's funny, when you read things
like the lensmen series it seems cliched until you realize it *is* cliched -
because so many others copied him.
