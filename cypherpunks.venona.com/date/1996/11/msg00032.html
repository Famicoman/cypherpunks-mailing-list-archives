&gt;&gt; Are there any current import restrictions for products on can legally
&gt;&gt; manufacture, sell, and use in the United States?
&gt;
&gt;Sure. Firearms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of
...

&gt;
&gt;What does all that have to do with crypto? It is the *same* issue. In the
&gt;government's view, crypto is a danger to their future plans, just as
&gt;firearms are. Do you think it is a coincidence that crypto is listed as a
&gt;munition? Think about it for just a moment. Crypto is a weapon in the
&gt;hands of the people. And that's what Cypherpunks is all about.
&gt;
&gt;Starting from import restrictions, you will see restrictions on size of
&gt;keys (=maximum rounds in the magazine, now set at 10, proposed to be
&gt;lowered to six), who may own it (no felons, people convicted of certain
&gt;misdemeanors), who may sell it and how it can be purchased (must provide
&gt;identification, sales will be logged). I guess you can figure out the rest.
&gt;
&gt;--Lucky

Yes, but crypto is one of the first intangible 'munitions'.  It is much
easier to constrain physical items than data.  That is why anonimity,
especially financial transaction anonymity, is so aboherant to LE.
