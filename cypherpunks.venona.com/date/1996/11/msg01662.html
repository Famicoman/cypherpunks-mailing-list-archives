Dear "Info",


Mr. Stephen Boursy has made a number of important revelations here.
I went back and read nearly all his posts, and I will say this _again_,
I have found NOTHING to suggest a lack of reliability in what he says.

I am in no way affiliated to Mr. Boursy. I have never seen his face, even.

In fact I had hardly noticed Mr. Boursy's presence till only a few days
ago, when the forcible expulsion of Russian Mathematician Dimitri Vulis
from the "cypherpunks" list fell like a bomb over my naive gullible head.
Only AFTER this, I started reading ALL the previous postings that I had
missed (about 60-70 % of them).

I decided to find out what's happening.

I saw OBVIOUS things, and OBVIOUS LIES, since as a lurker who kept
ALL previous postings (in the Freedom-Knights list and elsewhere) I could
COMPARE my archives to what people claimed.  More often than not, to
my amazement, what a LOT of people claimed were packs of lies. And against
Mr. Boursy and Mr. Dimitri Vulis in particular, entire SEWAGES of lies.

'
So I forward this info to... "INFO", the Weekly Net-Supplement of
"Eleftherotypia", Greece's largest and most democratic newspaper.

The Greek public are rather well informed on the "shiny" side of the
Internet. But (the director of "Info" and I) have met and discussed,
on two occasions, a few months ago,  ALSO the "DARK" side....

Our only problem, is VOLUME. It's like trying to clean up a shit-hole
which has spilled the shit even outside itself, in the garden... :-)

(The AMERICAN section of the internet, i.e. MOST of it).


Here goes...

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Boursy is a twit who has lost more accounts that Vulis.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I've lost but one account--world.std.com (Software Tool &amp;
&gt;Die) soon to be purchased by the conglomorate Plug Pullers
&gt;R US.  That was entirely related to a local rent control
&gt;matter.  Now I may be a 'twit'--that is an entirely
&gt;different matter.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I would suggest that it is not at all a "safe" indication of personal
&gt;&gt; or intellectual _worth_, (of Mr. Boursy or of anyone) "how many
&gt;&gt; accounts he has lost".
&gt;
&gt;   I would say though that if one makes false statements as has
&gt;this 'snow' character it indicates a lack of credibiltiy.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;    Ignore him.
&gt;
&gt;  Something you seem unable to do.  Isn't it odd how some will
&gt;tell you how insignificant and irrelevant you are only to devote
&gt;so much of their time and energy to you.  I find that very odd.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It is not ethical to send such strong negative _injunctions_ to masses
&gt;&gt; of people and also to strangers (the 1900-strong members of the cyberphunks
&gt;&gt; list for instance). 
&gt;
&gt;  Well thanks George but I do think his statement speak for themselves.
&gt;I'm not in the least concerned someone like him could harm me--in fact
&gt;I find it very amusing that he is deemed 'acceptable for that list
&gt;while Dr. Vulis is not.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Because, you may or may not have strong reasons for
&gt;&gt; believing you are justified in such invalidation, but more than a 1000
&gt;&gt; people are now _told_ by (self-appointed) "experts" such as yourself what
&gt;&gt; and whom to ignore or to believe. (Like sheep led to the slaughter)...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   Well that's sort of like Tiny Tim Skirvin and his Global Killfile--
&gt;it does him more harm than those he is after--in fact little Tim reads
&gt;my every word.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; But what you are doing now, extending the "1-person-blacklist" to your
&gt;&gt; number-two-entry (Mr. Boursy) is exactly the thing that I hoped you might
&gt;&gt; avoid.
&gt;
&gt;  And based on lies as well--I've only had one account terminated--that
&gt;by Barry Shein who lives in Brookline, Ma. and that was entirely do
&gt;to real estate industry money and the rent control issue (a statewide
&gt;referrendum on rent control which existed only in Brookline, Cambridge,
&gt;and Boston)--many millions of dollars at stake there.  Shein is simply
&gt;a whore.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;         First they kicked out Dimitri Vulis.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;         Then they slandered and kept out Steve Boursy.
&gt;
&gt;  Well my suggestion--given the size of the list and that we have
&gt;numerous sympathizers there--is to have all of their posts forwarded
&gt;and publically post them for free and open discussion.
&gt;
&gt;                            Steve
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;         Then...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;         When they came after me, there was nobody left to support me.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (You can perhaps realize what this paraphrase is about)... :-(
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sincerily, and with... Sanity of Mind :-)
&gt;&gt; George Stathis
