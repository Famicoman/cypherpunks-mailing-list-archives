&gt;I know many people who were happy they had insurance due to car
&gt;accidents, health problems, or whatever.  What is more, the odds of
&gt;these events are carefully calculated and available.  Call an actuary.

&gt;Are there similar sources of information calculating privacy risk?  I
&gt;don't think so.

&gt;Informally, I don't know anybody who has suffered due to a loss of
&gt;privacy.

&gt;It may be the case that it is politically beneficial to have a society
&gt;of privacy fanatics.  But, this is different from the direct benefit
&gt;to each participant.

&gt;My question remains unanswered, probably because privacy isn't worth
&gt;the effort.

Well I can give you a couple of examples from personel "suffering" from loss of privacy:

#1. While living in KC I had a co-worker obtain my SS# which he then used to have all his
utilities put in my name. (Utility companies only asked for SS#, Name &amp; Place of
employment). I did not find this out until 9mo. later when I went to have utilities turned
on in my new house. (I was previously living in an apartment which utilities were included
in the rent). It took several months, an attorny &amp; many calls to the utility board to get
the mess straightend out.

#2. The Ill. State Police got my name cross-referenced with a convicted fellon in thier
computer system. Didn't find this one out until I needed to get my security clearance
renewed for a contract. Needless to say the client was not pleased. This took over a year
to get straightend out and god only knows how many other computer systems still has me
listed as a convicted car theif. Funniest part is that while this guy was rotting in jail
I was living overseas.

It is all too easy today with the current state of computer &amp; information technology to
get f***ed. Needless to say I take my privacy much more seriously than I did before.
