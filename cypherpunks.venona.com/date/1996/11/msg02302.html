&gt; Notably, the emphasis is on the needs of business, not "people."
&gt; 
&gt; We are in an excellent position to observe and document the process whereby
&gt; "business" -- that is, organizations motivated primarily, if not
exclusively,
&gt; by the desire for short-term profits accruing to vested interests -- comes
&gt; to dominate and control a technology.  The auto and television industries
come
&gt; to mind as two prior examples.  We are about to see the net go the same way.
&gt; Take notes.
&gt; 
&gt; 			"I have to praise the administration and Ira for
&gt;                       reaching out to the private sector for
&gt;                       comments," Computers and Communication
&gt;                       Industry Association President Ed Black said.
&gt;                       "There's a great emphasis on the needs of
&gt;                       business here."
&gt; 
&gt;                       Even so, privacy activists remained
&gt;                       disappointed with many of the document's
&gt;                       features. "This isn't anything new," said David
&gt;                       Banisar, counsel to the Electronic Privacy and
&gt;                       Information Center. "The privacy stuff is
&gt;                       terrible. They say it's market driven, but
&gt;                       markets don't work with privacy. It's like what
&gt;                       happened with P-Trak."
&gt; 

You bring up a point that is implied - but not explicit - in the article.
And it's a good one. Funny thing is, two of the _industry_ folks suggested
individuals probably needed to be included in the document more than they
were. Neither was keen on being quoted on the record regarding non-business
interests, of course.

Given the attitude of the folks I talked to, I suspect non-business
interests are still fairly important to the White House on this one. 

And remember: Ira Magaziner won no friends in industry with his health care
proposals a couple of years back; some folks think he's leaning in favor of
industry at least initially to make sure what happened then doesn't happen
again.

If Netizens find suggestions from the administration too heavy-handed, my
guess is there's still time to move the discussion.

Cheers.
