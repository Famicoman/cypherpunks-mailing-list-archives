&gt; &gt; &gt; manifold::~==&gt;premail -t cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chain: haystack;jam
&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: I urgently need a lot of money.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please share your money-making secrets, I am in a desperate need
&gt; &gt; &gt; for cash.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For shame! Igor Chewed-off disgraces his Chewish Mommy by even asking. Isn'
&gt; &gt; propensity for "gesheft" genetic? Here's another money-making idea for Igor
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Igor obtains a list of e-mail addresses of people interested in equity-rela
&gt; &gt; investments (e.g. by watching misc.invest.* and sending the posters / those
&gt; &gt; voted for their creation unsolicited e-mail; or by posting anonymous ads,
&gt; &gt; inviting the readers to reply to a reply block in order to receive 3 free
&gt; &gt; promotional issues of an investment advice newsletter; or even by starting
&gt; &gt; his own private financial derivatives mailing list). Igor divides the maili
&gt; &gt; list into 2^3=8 parts, and gives them exotic Russian-sounding names: Alekse
&gt; &gt; Boris, Vasilij, Grigorij, Dmitrij, Elena, Zhenja, Zoya.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Igor then uses an anonymous remailer to spam everyone on his mailing list w
&gt; &gt; the 8 variants of the following message: "Congratulations! You have won 3 f
&gt; &gt; issued of the _Boris Investment Newsletter, published in Tulsa, Oklahoma, b
&gt; &gt; proud holder of a Master's Degree in Financial Engineering from the Moscow
&gt; &gt; State University. I predict that within the next month Adobe stock will go
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Instead of "Boris", Igor will substitute one of the 8 newsletter names; ins
&gt; &gt; of Adobe, he can use any volatile stock that's as likely to go up as down;
&gt; &gt; the predicted stock price movement will be "up" in the first four newslette
&gt; &gt; and "down" in the other four.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One month later the stock in question is either up or down. Without loss of
&gt; &gt; generality, suppose that it's gone down. Aleksej, Boris, Vasilij, and
&gt; &gt; Grigorij's investment advice was wrong, they disappear from the face of the
&gt; &gt; earth, and the former recipients of their newsletters don't get bothered an
&gt; &gt; more. (Or they could be recycled for future scams; or they could be send th
&gt; &gt; remaining 2 issues of worthless advice, as promised.) On the other hand
&gt; &gt; Dmitrij, Elena, Zhenja, and Zoya guessed right, so this time they send out
&gt; &gt; new investment newsletter via the anonymous remailers:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Congratulations! You continue to receive the free investment advice newsle
&gt; &gt; from Zoya in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Last month I correctly predicted that Adobe w
&gt; &gt; have gone down. If you're smart, you've shorted Adobe's stock and made lots
&gt; &gt; money by now. This month I predict that Cisco will go _down as well."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, Dmitrij and Elena predict that some other volatile stock goes up, wh
&gt; &gt; Zhenja and Zoya predict that it goes down. Suppose D&amp;E are right. Igor leav
&gt; &gt; the Zh.&amp;Z. partitions alone. One month later D&amp;E's subscribers get letter #
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Congratulations! You continue to receive the free investment advice newsle
&gt; &gt; from Elena in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two months ago I predicted that Adobe would
&gt; &gt; down. I hope you sold it short. Last month I predicted that Cisco would go
&gt; &gt; I hope you bought it. This month I predict that Lucent will go _up."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One month later one of the two is right, so its recipients get the fourth a
&gt; &gt; final e-mail from an anonymous remailer, this time using a reply block:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "I've given you three free stock tips over the last 3 months which probably
&gt; &gt; made you a lot of money. Now that you've seen my track record, you'll want
&gt; &gt; continue receiving my free advice, but the free promotion is over. Please s
&gt; &gt; $20 in untraceable digital cash to this reply block to receive 6 future
&gt; &gt; issues."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Quite a few people would risk the $20, but that would be the last they hear
&gt; &gt; from Igor. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (Alternatively, he can even e-mail 6 more issues of worthless advice to tho
&gt; &gt; who caughed up the $20, so they can't complain. It would be hard to prosecu
&gt; &gt; Igor without proving that all 8 newsletters were published by the same pers
&gt; &gt; who's been giving contradictory advice to different people.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; But what Law would you charge him with?
&gt; Unless you could prove his "intent" I see no way that you
&gt; could ever prove any case against him.

The intent is to defraud, but shouldn't absolute free speech protect fraud
and libel?

&gt; &gt; "Credibility is expendable." - John Gilmore
&gt;
&gt; He just says that because he spent his.

That's very true - he has none left whatsoever. What a sorry piece of work.
