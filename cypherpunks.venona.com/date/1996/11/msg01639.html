&gt; &gt;&gt; Examples [of people who have suffered due to loss of privacy]?
&gt; &gt;Phil Zimmermann often tells the story of a woman whose marriage
&gt; &gt;was destroyed by the revelation of a long-past indiscretion. 
&gt; &gt;After her husband divorced her, she committed suicide.
&gt; Deceiving your spouse is not a good reason to protect your privacy.

      Sure it is. Earlier this year I threw a party for my wifes birthday.
A suprise party. I had to deceive her to keep her out of the house I needed
privacy to do this.    

&gt; &gt;Any number of celebrities have been stalked, attacked and even
&gt; &gt;killed by obsessed fans who found them through public records.
&gt; Unfortunately most readers of this list do not have this problem.

     It is still a valid example. Someone made the claim that people do not
need privacy, this is an example of someone who needs it. 
&gt; &gt;Every year, children and business executives are kidnapped for
&gt; &gt;ransom.  The proximate cause of these kidnappings is a breach in
&gt; &gt;privacy about the whereabouts and schedules of the victim.  
&gt; Or this problem.

     See above.

&gt; &gt;Hitler's gun registration in Germany allowed the Jews to be
&gt; &gt;disarmed.  I'm sure you are aware of the ultimate consequences
&gt; &gt;of that little invasion of privacy.
&gt; Not a bad example, but genocide happens rarely.

     Germany. Cambodia, Boznia, Somilia, Rwanda &amp; Zaire. Soviet Russia, 
China...

     All within the last 60 years. 

     Yup. Rarely happen. 

&gt; Those alert enough to protect their privacy in advance might be alert
&gt; enough to get out in time, anyway.
&gt; Subjective utility: low.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The US Post Office co-operated in the identification and 
&gt; &gt;imprisonment of people of Japanese ancestry during the second
&gt; &gt;world war.
&gt; 97,000 victims over a ~100 year period.  Doesn't really show up on the
&gt; scope, sorry.  (Plus downside bad, but few were murdered.)

     I am sure that there are other victims in the PO's history, but 
not with as big of numbers. 

     1 is a crime, 100,000 is a crying shame. 

     You know that red thing you see when you open your eyes? It's your 
prostate. 


&gt; &gt;The problem with having a whole lot of private information about
&gt; &gt;you floating around in public is not what damage it can do to you
&gt; &gt;now, but rather the problems it potentially could cause in the
&gt; &gt;will you be about them if there is extreme right or left takeover
&gt; &gt;in the future?  Start to get the picture?
&gt; These things CAN happen.  Will they happen?  Odds are low.
&gt; BTW, are you operating under your True Name?

     I am, but I don't mind being a target. 

     If you think privacy is so bad, why are you indulging in it.
