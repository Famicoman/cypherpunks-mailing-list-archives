&gt;&gt; Man you're nutts. There are very few and quite vast Media Companies

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Even your American President is in reality a puppet of the Trilateral
&gt;&gt; Commission, who effectively also control CNN, the Washington Post,
&gt;&gt; and many many many other things all over the world.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; And you are saying that control of the media by ownership is
&gt;&gt; impossible?  You're far out maaan! :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Only in America such a naive opinion could actually be _believed_.
&gt;&gt; (here I go again... aga! :-) )
&gt;
&gt;Is this a troll?

Nope; It's the truth. Expressed like a sarcastic joke as well, but
it's _true_. And not intended to be a troll at all.

As regards the "gullibility", it's plainly dangerous; And cultivated
by the Media, apparently stronger in the U.S. than in many other places.

But: How many times do I have to state explicitly that my grumbles about
America are not "anti-American" (troll) propaganda? Nope; They're grumbles
about _freedoms_, that if you Americans lose, the rest of the world will
_also_ lose, (even quicker, I think)... Here is a REAL example:



(written by E. Francis, on the "Trilateral Commission", and distributed
 to all members of his own -private- mailing list, of which I'm a part).


&gt;THE LAND OF SHADOWS
&gt;
&gt;     Early this month is the last presidential 
&gt;"election" before the year 2000. As of this writing and 
&gt;long before, the election was decided in favor of Bill 
&gt;Clinton. It works out astrologically, but the real 
&gt;reason is because Clinton's bosses control the 
&gt;corporations that control the nation, and they also 
&gt;happen to own the major media which, shall we say, help 
&gt;the public make up its mind about who to vote for -- 
&gt;media like CNN, NBC, The Washington Post, The New York 
&gt;Times, Tribune Co., Time-Warner and others.
&gt;     This is not speculation, and if you would allow me 
&gt;to pre-empt this astrological column with a brief 
&gt;exposé, I will explain. All of these news organizations 
&gt;are members of an international institution called the 
&gt;Trilateral Commission (which is listed in the Manhattan 
&gt;phone book, by the way). Bill Clinton and more than 20 
&gt;of his cabinet ministers are also on the list. Bob Dole 
&gt;isn't a member, and neither is Jack Kemp, so in a very 
&gt;real sense, they are the outsider candidates.
&gt;     Since the organization's creation in 1973, every 
&gt;White House has had Trilateral Commission 
&gt;representation, starting with former Vice President 
&gt;Nelson D. Rockefeller, the brother of the Commission's 
&gt;co-founder, David Rockefeller. In 1976, Jimmy Carter, a 
&gt;member of the Commission and close associate of the 
&gt;Rockefellers, was "elected" president, and so on down 
&gt;the line in an unbroken chain through Bill Clinton. In 
&gt;one presidential election in the 1980s, all three 
&gt;candidates were Trilateralists! And in the election 
&gt;right before the current one, it was Trilateralist 
&gt;George Bush versus Trilateralist Bill Clinton. It's a 
&gt;little like both candidates in the old Soviet elections 
&gt;coming from the Communist party.
&gt;     You may wonder, "What's the big deal?" But look at 
&gt;it this way. What if every president or vice president 
&gt;for the past 22 years had been an executive of Grumman 
&gt;Aerospace or a graduate of Harvard University? You 
&gt;might suspect that Grumman or Harvard had a little 
&gt;extra influence and was getting its people into 
&gt;positions of power. But since the nation's most 
&gt;powerful media are also represented on the Commission, 
&gt;its existence rarely gets reported, and its true nature 
&gt;is never accurately reported except in the alternative 
&gt;media. Check the National Newspaper Index in any 
&gt;library and you'll find, at most, one or two references 
&gt;to the Commission, and both seek to belittle its 
&gt;importance.
&gt;     And people who are involved in the organization 
&gt;don't like to talk about it. I recently caught up with 
&gt;Secretary of the Interior (and Trilateral Commission 
&gt;member) Bruce Babbit while he was on a speaking 
&gt;engagement at the posh Mohonk Mountain House in my 
&gt;area. A number of newspaper reporters were gathered 
&gt;around him asking him the usual trivia. When I asked 
&gt;him directly about his involvement on the commission, 
&gt;and the president's, and that of some two dozen other 
&gt;cabinet members, with the red light of a video camera 
&gt;coming from behind me, Bruce cracked a joke about how I 
&gt;would be a popular guy "out west" (ostensibly where 
&gt;everybody has weird political theories), then he turned 
&gt;tail and ran away from the news conference.
&gt;     Commission membership also includes key federal 
&gt;legislators, people on the incredibly powerful Federal 
&gt;Reserve Board, major bankers and the CEOs of numerous 
&gt;corporations of the General Electric and General Foods 
&gt;ilk. And it's an international institution as well, 
&gt;_majority-dominated by business and political interests 
&gt;in other lands, particularly Germany and Japan_. 
&gt;Consider the implications. It is arguable that the 
&gt;Trilateral White House is dominated by government and 
&gt;business interests of foreign nations, which is 
&gt;clearly, blatantly unconstitutional.
&gt;     The above-mentioned national media directly 
&gt;involved with this organization, which set the national 
&gt;news agenda here in the U.S. and for much of the 
&gt;western world, are the same ones which are manipulating 
&gt;the current election by sanitizing all the news that 
&gt;should be coming out of Washington and elsewhere, by 
&gt;not tallying the impressive pile of corpses collecting 
&gt;around the President, and most of all, by bombarding us 
&gt;with PR-generated trivia and commercials 24 hours a day 
&gt;when there are somewhat more significant things to 
&gt;concern ourselves with.
&gt;     And of course, the economy keeps getting better.
&gt;     But just in case you ever wondered just how it 
&gt;happened that some unknown governor of Arkansas ended 
&gt;up tooling around the globe aboard Air Force One, now 
&gt;you have a clue. And in case you thought people were 
&gt;stupid, well, this makes a good case for people just 
&gt;being manipulated. But of course, you'd have no way of 
&gt;knowing this if the only place you got your information 
&gt;was a television set or newspaper. Perhaps this is why 
&gt;big government is so interested in censoring the 
&gt;Internet.
&gt;     I don't believe that the Trilateral Commission is 
&gt;a conspiracy, I believe it's just one fact of how the 
&gt;ruling class of the Western world organizes itself. 
&gt;     There are other levels of aristocratic shadow-
&gt;government organization, and they're quite worth while 
&gt;to study, but this one sure points to some interesting 
&gt;possibilities, and boy, the fact that you never hear it 
&gt;mentioned should make really you wonder.
&gt;     Not that there isn't enough to wonder about 
&gt;already, and not that any of it matters.
&gt;     After all, nothing really happens nowadays. Flight 
&gt;800 got shot down, but nobody did it. It just sort of 
&gt;exploded and fell out of the sky. Not only wasn't there 
&gt;a perpetrator, there wasn't even a cause determined for 
&gt;the explosion!
&gt;     We have wars -- safe ones, where nobody comes back 
&gt;with their arms and legs blown off. The federal budget 
&gt;deficit increased by a few billion dollars in the time 
&gt;it took me to write this article, and yet it's 
&gt;meaningless. There is no public mention of the 
&gt;Constitutional amendment, the famous 14th Amendment, 
&gt;which explicitly states, "The validity of the public 
&gt;debt of the United States...shall not be questioned." 
&gt;It's the law of the land!
&gt;     So, lest I blow a few too many of my brain cells 
&gt;thinking about this, I will now go back to being an 
&gt;astrologer.
&gt;     End of exposé
