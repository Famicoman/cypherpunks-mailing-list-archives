oh mindless aga,

&gt;&gt; This betrays your ignorance.  I.Q. is scaled according to age.  One does
&gt;&gt; not "improve."

Certainly not in your case.
 
&gt;
&gt;I have no ignorance, except for being ignorant of stupid people
&gt;who call themselves "punks."

If you are ignorant of them, then how do you know that they are "stupid"?

&gt;Look asshole; it says "LAW DOCTOR" -- that is what "Juris Doctor"
&gt;means, stupid.  And I am about to stick the motherfucking Laws
&gt;right up your cocksucking ASS!

How is this possible? It seems that you are possible of rather contemptible contortions!


&gt;"Juris" means Law.  So Juris Doctor means "Law Doctor."

Clinging to technicalities here, aren't we?

&gt;that is irrelevant, and you are off-topic.

Oooh! Oooh! Point the finger here, aga, at YOURSELF!

&gt;Europe is also irrelevant, and you keep missing the point here.
&gt;You have added the cypherpunks list again, and that was forbidden.

What a wonderful statement: Europe is irrelevant!!! A truly educated mind here. 

&gt;look asshole, you really want that list killed, do you not?
&gt;I have no bounds, as you will soon learn.

When one is clapped in irons and thrown into prison for whatever it is that your acts can be classified under, then I am pretty sure they have _some_ bounds.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Be careful who you threaten.  It might get you in trouble.

One wonders if you ever pay attention to what you actually write, aga?

&gt;WRONG!  There is NO crime which covers anything that one does
&gt;internationally!   And mailbombing is NOT "Unauthorized access,"
&gt;regardless of where it occurs!

Uhm...oops, aga, you're wrong here, there are plenty of crimes that are international crimes. War crimes for example, which o against the Geneva convention. Child abduction crimes, which go against the Hague convention. But I am sure they will give you a slight slap on the  wrist, after all, you are only a stupid hillbilly with no idea of the law.

&gt;Pitt-1975; Dissertation was in 1983 actions.  I practiced for
&gt;six years, and then became perfect.  I currently do not practice for
&gt;any parties other than myself, family, corporation or Institutes,
&gt;and I need no license for that. And since I do not carry any
&gt;license from any State, there is NOTHING that you can do to stop me.

Assassination comes to mind...

&gt;The State disciplinary board has no jurisdiction, nor does any
&gt;Law.  A Criminal Lawyer is a specialist in ripping new assholes
&gt;on the witness stand, and that must now also be practiced on the net,
&gt;it seems.  Remember, you are the one who asked for this, "Sadam."

You seem to have this absolute _fascination_ with asses, faggots, cocks, and ripping _new_ assholes (as if you weren't a big enough one already. This is obviously some sort of concious repression: you just can't face the truth, can you, aga?

&gt;This is a world-wide internet problem that you are about to get
&gt;taken care of.  You will be among the first locations to be
&gt;eliminated.  And just remember that your termination is your own
&gt;doing.  You had your chance to keep the fucking cypherpunks list
&gt;OFF of your e-mail to me, and blew it.

Do we run and hide now, mommy?

&gt;&gt; I suggest a hobby which entails more physical activity.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;I pump iron and run three times a week.  And as a Tae Kwon Do
&gt;black belt holder, I get lots of physical activity. I am in
&gt;better physical shape than any other man that you know.

He/she/it pumps iron, does he/she/it? Whilst running? No mean feat for a thing without a brain. Assuming that you are better than anyone else you have probably never met, someone who probably has no desire to meet a thing like yourself, is yet another example of your sheer assonance!

&gt;And just understand, as far as the internet is concerned, Europe does
&gt;not mean SHIT!

Of course not...I am sure the European Internet thinks the same as you. After all, an inanimate object seems to think just as much as you!
