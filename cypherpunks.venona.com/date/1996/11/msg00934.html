        Other than the fact it is probably from a front for one of Dan 
    Lassiters' Little Rock companies, now owned by Alltel, it's worth
    a read. large scale enigma encoding is not bullet proof, but it can
    make your life miserable.  I did not take the time to calculate the
    permutations...  
        I wonder if anyone told them the data recovery teams can pull
    multiple layers of data off a disc after it has been stripped?
        FYR, the explanatory text from their front page is below.

&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Enigma Welcome Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="eng2.gif"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;CLEAR=ALL&gt;&lt;HR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Welcome to Enigma &amp; Co.!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

The following text contains various terms that you may not be familiar with.
Please refer to the Glossary section for a description of those terms, or
feel free to call us for more detailed information on how we can help you with
your data security needs.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;

A data protection system for businesses and individuals, the Enigma &amp; Co.
related products offers security with the means to 
create personalized encryption schemes in an infinite variety.  In 
addition, the versions include a complete package of security 
management tools to enable it to be used in a business or office environment 
under the oversight of authorized administrators. It also provides routines 
to handle binary encryption and decryption of both text and non text files 
as well as all the capabilities needed to accommodate BBS, E-Mail and Internet 
communications.
It is for these reasons plus many more which you will discover in using the
software why our users think it is the finest cryptographic software ever
produced.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
In addition, unlike public key and other mathmatical cryptographic programs, there
is nothing in the messages and files you encrypt that aids in the deciphering of
your data.  If you encrypt twenty bytes, then the encrypted file is twenty bytes,
containing no clue on how to decipher it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt; About Enigma &amp; Co.'s Cryptography Products&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Here's some insight into the enormous power and security offered by Enigma &amp;
Company's products.  You do not need to know all the in's and out's of these
features to use it effectively.  We've designed our systems to be extremely
easy to use.  Some of the main features are:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Wheels:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Our Enigma's can use from three up to eight wheels at a 
time.  A Wheel is a scrambled dataset of characters that is used by the Enigma
systems that your computer randomly creates.  There are
no limit to the number of WheelSets (datasets of wheels) that you can create.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Usable Characters:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Our Enigma uses 83 characters on its text wheels and 256 on
its binary wheels. This gives the Enigma user more than six billion more 
starting
text wheel configurations ("shifts") to choose from, each one of which
will produce an entirely different encryption.  The use of all eight
binary wheels, of course, exceeds this number tremendously. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Indicator Word:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; To make the enciphered message even more difficult
to break, our software provides another feature which allows the sender
to enter a word or a simple phrase that has the effect of adding a
virtual ninth wheel to the text enciphering combination.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Multiple Cryptions:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Probably one of the best features of the Enigma
products, you have the means of storing your personalized WheelSets and your Schemes
and then do cryptions in a multiple fashion, using different
WheelSets, different Schemes, and if in text mode, different Indicator
words.  You can also Cross Crypt, that is encrypting in text (83
character) and then in binary (256 characters). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Parameters:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We created even more power over the cryptive process by adding parameters 
for both Text and Binary which allow the user to define the direction the 
wheel in each slot will rotate, and the number of turns before it triggers 
the next wheel to rotate in its predetermined direction.  Predefined WheelSets 
and Schemes are also included as well as data files to save and restore 
parameter settings.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Passes:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The Enigma systems allow
the passing each character back and forth as many as 99 times, a device 
which effectively turns an eight wheel encryption to a 792 wheel encryption or
a 891 wheel encryption with an Indicator Word.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Personal Schemes:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Added to the above, the Enigma user is not confined
to the wheel "wirings" that come with this software. He or she is
encouraged to create personalized wheels and schemes, setups that can
be tailored for groups of correspondents or individuals. And to avoid
the possibility of using the wrong scheme with the wrong person, Enigma
allows each special setup to be given a separate file name for later
recall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Slots and Shifts:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Each user has the ability of placing different
wheels into the slots in whatever order they prefer and then shifting
them prior to the cryption process.  The act of shifting can in effect
create a totally different wheel from the original positions of that
wheel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;B&gt;Shift Ratios:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; To further complicate the encryption process you can
specify the number of shifts the wheels will rotate when it is triggered instead
of only one rotation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
 
&lt;B&gt;System Files:&lt;/B&gt;All your system files can be removed (cannot be recovered),
transferred and restored either all at once or individually.  The system files
consist of WheelSets, Schemes, Parameters and Code Book data. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt; About Enigma &amp; Company's Ultra Enigma&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

The Ultra Enigma system evolved by the addition of a ten numeric input 'key' 
in the parameter screen.  These ten sets of numbers are used to 'shotgun' the original
message anywhere between eight and five hundred plus times its size, depending
on the values in those ten 'key' inputs.  Ultra hides your data in a sea of
data, thus making decoding by brute force an absolute nightmare.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

As our system evolved, three modes of cryption were developed and all three
are present in Ultra Enigma and can be utilized as part of the operating system. 
Styles 1 and 2 are one-to-one processing (files are not expanded).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

In addition, all sensitive data files used by Ultra Enigma can be Transferred,
Restored and Killed (unrecovering them are impossible) leaving your computer
useless to theft and misuse.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
 
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
