&gt; 
&gt; Not true. "Society" has passed through Africa many times, the people
&gt; revert to their previous ways.

I disagree. Only some ways, you don't see them tossing their AK 47s for spears.

&gt; &gt; Further, many of the leftist critiques of "moneylending as exploitation"
&gt; &gt; are similar to past (and current) demonizations of moneychangers,
&gt; &gt; moneylenders, shylocks, and other assorted stereotypes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't favor nationalistic lending and borrowing policies, which, for
&gt; &gt; example, involve some central government borrowing money, sending the
&gt; &gt; borrowed funds to personal Swiss bank accounts, and then sticking the
&gt; &gt; nominal taxpayers with the debt. Nothing I have said here endorses
&gt;  this.
&gt; 
&gt; But that's the only way it hapens in the third world. The only time
&gt; foreign aid is not gutted by corrupt beaurocrats is when the
&gt; Westerners go there and manage the projects themselves. This is quite
&gt; different from a loan.

Wrong, and wrong. Lending to individuals is happening, in $100 or so ammounts, without westerners (or their governments' crooked bureaucrats) present, right now.

&gt; &gt; But much lending is useful. It's the way factories get built, the way
&gt; &gt; things get done.
&gt; 
&gt; Heh, have you ever *seen* a third world factory 10 years after it was
&gt; built. Nice bit of scap, that.

Ask of government was involved.

&gt; &gt; Much of the criticism of "moneylenders" is closely related, if you
&gt;  think
&gt; &gt; about it, to criticism of "money launderers." Cypherpunks should relish
&gt;  the
&gt; &gt; rise of new mechanisms for money laundering, moneylending, tax evasion,
&gt;  etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I took the "Wired" quote about Walter Wriston "sounding like a
&gt;  cypherpunk"
&gt; &gt; to represent this new view, in explicit contrast to his earlier views
&gt;  when
&gt; &gt; he headed Citibank and they had a more statist approach.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your mileage may vary, but tired homilies about lending being exploitati
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; are not very useful in this day and age.
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno, pearls befre swine still applies. It's not that I think
&gt; lending is bad, but large economic development loans to thrild world
&gt; countries continue to support corruption and oppression, and not much
&gt; else.

Because of governments more than banks. You are beginning to see the light.
