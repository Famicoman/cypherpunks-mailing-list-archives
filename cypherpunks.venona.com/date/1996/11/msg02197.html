     If you think that most people on welfare live _purely_ off welfare

     I would like to formally invite you to come live in my neighborhood 
for a couple weeks and see how these "welfare" moms are "taking care of 
their children". 

 welfare (at least here)  would *much* rather get a decent job and work
&gt; for their money. There are, perhaps, a few people who would rather not
&gt; work for minimum wage (who find it impossible to feed their family on
&gt; that) but I suspect that those folks are few and far between. 

     You are living in a dream world. In most major cities there are NO 
full time minimum wage jobs left, other than waiting tables (which pays 
minimum + tips) Macdonalds starts people at 6 to 6.50 an hour. 

&gt; &gt; More bullshit.  You don't know what anyones motives are.  To ascribe your

&gt; Just to be clear, I don't really agree with the original points being

    Speaking of Pot Kettle Black. 

    In the Chicago paper last sunday there were over 30 pages of Help Wanted 
ads. There is a lot of work out there, and there are a lot of agencies who
will help you find work, and train for work. There is no reason why anyone 
needs welfare. Stupid and lazy is not a reason.
