dude, you put the cypherpunks list in the header again.
You really want that list killed, do you not?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really, I had an I.Q. of 149, and a perfect 4.00 from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two different colleges, before I did my Doctorate in Law.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 149 puts you at the low end of the scale, or used to, around here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; True, they say genius only starts at 150; but I think I have
&gt; &gt; improved since then.
&gt; 
&gt; This betrays your ignorance.  I.Q. is scaled according to age.  One does
&gt; not "improve."
&gt; 

I have no ignorance, except for being ignorant of stupid people
who call themselves "punks."

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact (if true) that you bothered to get a Doctorate in Law, rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; than a Juris Doctor, tends to disprove the above however.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look dude, a Juris Doctor IS a Doctorate of Law.
&gt; 
&gt; Incorrect.
&gt; 

Look asshole; it says "LAW DOCTOR" -- that is what "Juris Doctor"
means, stupid.  And I am about to stick the motherfucking Laws
right up your cocksucking ASS!

&gt; One can obtain a Doctorate in Law, (As in Dr.) but it is generally a
&gt; pointless endeavor except in some civil law jurisdictions.  (Liechtenstein
&gt; is a good example, where many attornies have a Dr.Iur. (Dr.) while others
&gt; merely have a Lic.Iur. (J.D.) ).
&gt; 
&gt; A J.D. requires no dissertation.
&gt; A Doctorate in Law does.
&gt; 

Wrong.  A J.D. requires a 75 page moot-court dissertation which
is always new legal research.

&gt; I submit you know too little about any of these to have attained either
&gt; one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do not confuse it with a L.L.D. which is a "Doctorate
&gt; &gt; of Legal Letters"  A J.D. is the only current valid
&gt; &gt; Doctorate that you can do in plain "Law."
&gt; 
&gt; Incorrect.
&gt; 
&gt; A J.D. is not a true Doctorate, and even if it were, it would not be the
&gt; only current valid "Doctorate" that you can "do" in "plain Law."
&gt; 

"Juris" means Law.  So Juris Doctor means "Law Doctor."

&gt; Georgetown, as an example, offers a Doctorate in Law degree which requires
&gt; a J.D., an LL.M. and three years of legal teaching experience simply to
&gt; qualify for the program.
&gt; 

that is irrelevant, and you are off-topic.

&gt; A Doctor of Judicial Science program is also available with many of the
&gt; same requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; Both programs require a dissertation and a defense of same.
&gt; 
&gt; San Marcos University is also known for an exceptional Doctor of Laws
&gt; program.
&gt; 
&gt; Incidently, LL.D.s are rare and generally useful only in European circles.
&gt; 

Europe is also irrelevant, and you keep missing the point here.
You have added the cypherpunks list again, and that was forbidden.

&gt; As usual, you have overextended your bounds and now find yourself swimming
&gt; in water over your head.
&gt; 

look asshole, you really want that list killed, do you not?
I have no bounds, as you will soon learn.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go to law school.  In the meantime, shut up.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go and eat your swiss cheese, as that is apparently all you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are good for.  My mercenaries are too busy to go to europe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer Chedder.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Be careful who you threaten.  It might get you in trouble.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Threatening to wipe out your location on the InterNet is
&gt; &gt; not against ANY law whatsoever, and I can mailbomb you, do
&gt; &gt; a DOS attack, fork-bomb attack and virus attack against you,
&gt; &gt; all of which are perfectly legal.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, they are not.  Unauthorized access of a computer system is a
&gt; crime.  Anyone who had a "doctorate" in law would know this.
&gt; 

WRONG!  There is NO crime which covers anything that one does
internationally!   And mailbombing is NOT "Unauthorized access,"
regardless of where it occurs!

&gt; I doubt your reference to mercenaries was merely a threat to my system,
&gt; but keep pushing if you like.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look asshole, I graduated from Law School with a Doctorate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 1975.  Now just go away and stop interfering with our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; American Net.
&gt; 
&gt; Which law school?  And did you do a dissertation?  What is its title?  Do
&gt; you practice?  What state are you licensed in?
&gt; 

Pitt-1975; Dissertation was in 1983 actions.  I practiced for
six years, and then became perfect.  I currently do not practice for
any parties other than myself, family, corporation or Institutes,
and I need no license for that. And since I do not carry any
license from any State, there is NOTHING that you can do to stop me.
The State disciplinary board has no jurisdiction, nor does any
Law.  A Criminal Lawyer is a specialist in ripping new assholes
on the witness stand, and that must now also be practiced on the net,
it seems.  Remember, you are the one who asked for this, "Sadam."

This is a world-wide internet problem that you are about to get
taken care of.  You will be among the first locations to be
eliminated.  And just remember that your termination is your own
doing.  You had your chance to keep the fucking cypherpunks list
OFF of your e-mail to me, and blew it.

&gt; &gt; Face the real fact of life though dude.  There is absolutely NO LAW
&gt; &gt; which prevents me from attacking and/or eliminating any address
&gt; &gt; outside of the USA, that is, even if there were any law which would
&gt; &gt; prevent me from doing the same thing to any non-government
&gt; &gt; computer right here, which there is not.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, do it.  We'll see.
&gt; 

You asked for it, so what you have coming is your own doing.

&gt; &gt; Your only protection on this Internet is to have a dozen different
&gt; &gt; addresses to access from.  I can put a dozen computers up on
&gt; &gt; a dozen different T1's right now, if need be.
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest a hobby which entails more physical activity.
&gt; 

I pump iron and run three times a week.  And as a Tae Kwon Do
black belt holder, I get lots of physical activity. I am in
better physical shape than any other man that you know.

&gt; Forward complaints to : European Association of Envelope Manufactures
&gt; Finger for Public Key   Gutenbergstrasse 21;Postfach;CH-3001;Bern
&gt; Vote Monarchist         Switzerland
&gt; 

Now YOU have added the cypherpunks list again.
A proper reaction is justified, so have the cypherpunks
thank you for what is coming...

And just understand, as far as the internet is concerned, Europe does
not mean SHIT!

Your audience is terminated, permanently.
