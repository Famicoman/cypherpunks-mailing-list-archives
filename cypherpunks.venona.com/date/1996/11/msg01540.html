&gt; &gt;&gt; Privacy is a hassle.  Is it worth it?
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Which unfortunate situations does privacy prevent?  What are the odds
&gt; &gt;&gt; that they will occur?  How much effort will it take to prevent these
&gt; &gt;&gt; outcomes?  As a model, use the present and future situation of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; typical reader of this list.

&gt; 
&gt; I know many people who were happy they had insurance due to car
&gt; accidents, health problems, or whatever.  What is more, the odds of
&gt; these events are carefully calculated and available.  Call an actuary.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there similar sources of information calculating privacy risk?  I
&gt; don't think so.

Ah, so let's ignore the risks, on the grounds that we have no idea what
they might be, or their magnitude.  That's clever.  I like that.

&gt; Informally, I don't know anybody who has suffered due to a loss of
&gt; privacy.

Your circle of associations must be limited.
 
&gt; It may be the case that it is politically beneficial to have a society
&gt; of privacy fanatics.  But, this is different from the direct benefit
&gt; to each participant.

Agreed, but since you do not quantify the magnitude of either of these,
even in terms of speculation, I'm not sure what your point is.

&gt; My question remains unanswered, probably because privacy isn't worth
&gt; the effort.

And no one can answer that question but you.  Privacy is a personal
decision.  I'm sure there are many out there who will suffer no harm even
if their SSN is published in the Wall Street Journal.

Why, however, fail to take out insurance when the cost is so low?  Really
it doesn't take much in the way of effort or money to assure one's
privacy.  (Hint: It's getting cheaper every day in some ways).

Answer: Nearly all of the cost of privacy is concentrated in set up cost.
Maintaince costs are minimal once set up has been made.  Yet getting over
that first hurdle is the biggest leap.
