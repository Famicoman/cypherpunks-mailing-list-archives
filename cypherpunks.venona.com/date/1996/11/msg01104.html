&gt;&gt; Just as suddenly, the classic anti-free-speech arguments of "if you

&gt;&gt; how this resembles the "love it or leave it" mentality of certain
&gt;&gt; American patriotic organizations?)


&gt;Governments maintain a monopoly on land, so the "love it or leave it" mentality
&gt;is flawed.  Virtual space does not have the same limitations as physical
&gt;space.  Starting your own mailing list is relatively easy.

Not at all easy, for a lot of people. Moreover, it's very time-consuming.
It's only easy if you are prepared to put up with costs of time, money,
and also... service providers (who don't always agree with you)...

In a lot of places in the world, starting mailing lists is almost
impossible unless you can be _inside_ an Internet Provider Company
(and use Unix or whatever they use, in their own machines).




&gt;&gt; It is sad to note that this is the leader of one of America's
&gt;&gt; forerunning organizations of freedom who says these words. For all
&gt;&gt; *his* ideology of free speech, this statement reveals the hypocrasy he
&gt;&gt; lives with for all to see. The true litmus test of free speech is to
&gt;&gt; encounter speech that you *want* to censor.
&gt;
&gt;The EFF protects against government censorship, not against "editorial
&gt;control", "censorship", or whatever else you want to call it.  I don't
&gt;see this as hypocritical at all.

Perhaps cynical, though? :-)




&gt;&gt; Mr. Gilmore, and other like minded parties, might want to consider
&gt;&gt; what would happen if one parent company owned *all* communications
&gt;&gt; media. Would they they be so supportive of the ideology of ownership
&gt;&gt; and communciation they espouse?
&gt;
&gt;And just how plausible do you think this is?  I believe it is next to
&gt;impossible, unless it is the result of government regulation.



Man you're nutts. There are very few and quite vast Media Companies
in the world, and they're on the verge of becoming monopolies.

Even your American President is in reality a puppet of the Trilateral
Commission, who effectively also control CNN, the Washington Post,
and many many many other things all over the world.

And you are saying that control of the media by ownership is
impossible?  You're far out maaan! :-)

Only in America such a naive opinion could actually be _believed_.
(here I go again... aga! :-) )

George


P.S. Even if you offered me a million dollars I'd stay away from
     your country. My sanity is much more valuable.  :-)
     (The Immigration Authorities in the U.S. have missed the point:
      We DON'T want to come to you guys. It's the last thing we'd want!)
