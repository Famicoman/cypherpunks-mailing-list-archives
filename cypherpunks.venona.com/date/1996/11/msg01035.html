&gt;         uh, that's _why_ i am on this list...
&gt;  &gt;"Having a "navy.mil" domain probably is another reason, unless you 
&gt;  &gt;are only hear to monitor our discussions of using cryptography to 
&gt;  &gt;undermine the state, to liberate military secrets with BlackNet and 
&gt;  &gt;the Information Liberation Front, and to punish the millions of 
&gt;  &gt;those in the military-industrial complex who have so richly earned 
&gt;  &gt;their eventual punishments.
&gt;         military secrets, eh?  tell me something mr may, what secrets 
&gt;  have you uncovered in your undaunting quest to expose those corrupt 

     Believe me, if Blacknet ever becomes a reality, there will be 
military secrets for sale. 

&gt;  little guys in uniform?  mr may - i serve in the US Navy so you don't 

     The little guys corruption isn't a secret. I was there, and I know. 
Little People have Little Minds, and the scope of their corruption is 
mostly minor and annoying. 

&gt;  military does for the US is a good thing.  i skipped collage (don't 
&gt;  ask why) after graduating early from HS to enlist in the navy.  

     Didn't like your art classes?  

&gt;  keeping you free to bitch is why i am here.  never forget that the 
&gt;  freedom you enjoy comes with a price, mr may.
&gt;         the schools that you send your kids to (forgive me if you're 
&gt;  celibate or childless) are run by the govt.  am i saying they do a good 
&gt;  job?  not necessarily, but what i _am_ saying is that your kids _still_ 

     They did a better job when the governments _didn't_ run them, or at 
least the Federal Government didn't run them. 

&gt;  go.  i am almost positive, despite attempts to the contrary, that you 
&gt;  make use of the US postal system. 

     The US Postal System is not a government agency, it is a private 
company with a guarenteed monopoly.

&gt; the phone lines that you connect 
&gt;  that computer to were installed by - guess who? - there are a hundred 

    The local Phone Companies, not the government.

&gt;  other things you and i and everyone use that wouldn't be there if it 
&gt;  weren't for the USG (or state/county/municipal govt's).  tell me mr 

    Things like Jails for drug users, Massive corruption and forced 
economic redistribuion. Idiotic laws &amp;etc. Yes, lots of things that wouldn't
be there.
