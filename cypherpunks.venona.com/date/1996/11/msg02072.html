Yes, please kill us.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Look dude, a Juris Doctor IS a Doctorate of Law.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Incorrect.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Look asshole; it says "LAW DOCTOR" -- that is what "Juris Doctor"
&gt; means, stupid.  And I am about to stick the motherfucking Laws
&gt; right up your cocksucking ASS!

Well, unfortunately the force of your will can't change fact.  Nor can the
use of profanity or caps.

&gt; &gt; One can obtain a Doctorate in Law, (As in Dr.) but it is generally a
&gt; &gt; pointless endeavor except in some civil law jurisdictions.  (Liechtenstein
&gt; &gt; is a good example, where many attornies have a Dr.Iur. (Dr.) while others
&gt; &gt; merely have a Lic.Iur. (J.D.) ).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A J.D. requires no dissertation.
&gt; &gt; A Doctorate in Law does.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong.  A J.D. requires a 75 page moot-court dissertation which
&gt; is always new legal research.

Funny, I got mine without preforming such research.
I think you better write to Harvard and Georgetown and tell them they are
in trouble.  Their requirements are nothing like this.

&gt; &gt; A J.D. is not a true Doctorate, and even if it were, it would not be the
&gt; &gt; only current valid "Doctorate" that you can "do" in "plain Law."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "Juris" means Law.  So Juris Doctor means "Law Doctor."

Ah, QED then, right?

And the Pawnee tribe must be from india cause they are called "Indians."

&gt; &gt; Georgetown, as an example, offers a Doctorate in Law degree which requires
&gt; &gt; a J.D., an LL.M. and three years of legal teaching experience simply to
&gt; &gt; qualify for the program.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; that is irrelevant, and you are off-topic.

You claim that a J.D. and Doctorate in Law are the same degree.  I show
you a specific example which indicates otherwise, and it is irrelevant,
and off topic?

&gt; &gt; A Doctor of Judicial Science program is also available with many of the
&gt; &gt; same requirements.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Both programs require a dissertation and a defense of same.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; San Marcos University is also known for an exceptional Doctor of Laws
&gt; &gt; program.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Incidently, LL.D.s are rare and generally useful only in European circles.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Europe is also irrelevant, and you keep missing the point here.
&gt; You have added the cypherpunks list again, and that was forbidden.

Oh, I've been a baaad boy.
 
&gt; &gt; As usual, you have overextended your bounds and now find yourself swimming
&gt; &gt; in water over your head.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; look asshole, you really want that list killed, do you not?
&gt; I have no bounds, as you will soon learn.

I'm cowering from the big powerful hacker with a Doctorate in Law and such
scary words.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go and eat your swiss cheese, as that is apparently all you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are good for.  My mercenaries are too busy to go to europe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer Chedder.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be careful who you threaten.  It might get you in trouble.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Threatening to wipe out your location on the InterNet is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not against ANY law whatsoever, and I can mailbomb you, do
&gt; &gt; &gt; a DOS attack, fork-bomb attack and virus attack against you,
&gt; &gt; &gt; all of which are perfectly legal.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Actually, they are not.  Unauthorized access of a computer system is a
&gt; &gt; crime.  Anyone who had a "doctorate" in law would know this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; WRONG!  There is NO crime which covers anything that one does
&gt; internationally!   And mailbombing is NOT "Unauthorized access,"
&gt; regardless of where it occurs!

Study up on situs of a criminal act and jurisdiction please.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I doubt your reference to mercenaries was merely a threat to my system,
&gt; &gt; but keep pushing if you like.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look asshole, I graduated from Law School with a Doctorate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 1975.  Now just go away and stop interfering with our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; American Net.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Which law school?  And did you do a dissertation?  What is its title?  Do
&gt; &gt; you practice?  What state are you licensed in?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Pitt-1975; Dissertation was in 1983 actions.  I practiced for
&gt; six years, and then became perfect.

Which is why the Pennsylvania bar decided you had to be disbared.  I see.

&gt; I currently do not practice for
&gt; any parties other than myself, family, corporation or Institutes,
&gt; and I need no license for that.

Good thing too or you'd be fined for practicing without a license.

&gt; And since I do not carry any
&gt; license from any State, there is NOTHING that you can do to stop me.
&gt; The State disciplinary board has no jurisdiction, nor does any
&gt; Law.

You seem quite familiar with the disciplinary boards proceedures.  I think
a query for their records might be interesting.  Perhaps it would make an
entertaining post.


&gt; A Criminal Lawyer is a specialist in ripping new assholes
&gt; on the witness stand.

Clearly you were never a criminal lawyer.

&gt; This is a world-wide internet problem that you are about to get
&gt; taken care of.  You will be among the first locations to be
&gt; eliminated.  And just remember that your termination is your own
&gt; doing.  You had your chance to keep the fucking cypherpunks list
&gt; OFF of your e-mail to me, and blew it.

Oops, now what will I ever do?

&gt; I pump iron and run three times a week.  And as a Tae Kwon Do
&gt; black belt holder, I get lots of physical activity. I am in
&gt; better physical shape than any other man that you know.

I have a date this weekend already, thanks.
