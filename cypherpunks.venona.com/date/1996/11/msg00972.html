Declan's done an excellent journalistic job. I understand that because of the
space limitations he couldn't quote everything that everyone told him, so one
small point in his article might be misinterpreted by a casual reader:

Declan McCullagh &lt;declan@well.com&gt; writes:
&gt;    though, he's almost notorious. His .sig file, for instance, proudly
Why "almost"? :-)
&gt;    points out that he's a former Kook of the Month; Vulis was also a
There's no such thing as "former" KOTM, Declan. That's a lifetime achievement!
&gt;    Net-legend and even has the alt.fan.dimitri-vulis newsgroup named
&gt;    after him.
(I newgrouped a.f.d-v myself, actually. But it does get traffic :-)
&gt;    daily messages that came from Vulis's keyboard. The list is on
&gt;    Gilmore's machine and he can do what he wants with it; he can moderate
&gt;    the postings, he can censor material, he can shut the whole thing
&gt;    down. By kicking off an offending user, a list owner merely exercises
&gt;    his property right. There's no government involvement, so the First
&gt;    Amendment doesn't apply.

I told Declan that agree 100% - John Gilmore has the right to do anything
he likes with his private mailing list. The 1st Amendment does not apply.

However censorship needn't be government-imposed.

&gt;        For his part, Gilmore calls removing the Russian mathematician "an
&gt;    act of leadership." He says: "It said we've all been putting up with

An act of censorship, an act of cowardice, an act of Hitler-like leadership...

&gt;    this guy and it's time to stop. You're not welcome here... It seemed
&gt;    to me that a lot of the posts on cypherpunks were missing the mark.
&gt;    They seemed to have an idea that their ability to speak through my
&gt;    machine was guaranteed by the Constitution."

If John Gilmore ascribes this opinion to me, then he's lying outright.
