&gt;&gt; &gt;No, he was right.  They can't prove that their system is unbreakable.
&gt;&gt; &gt;They _might_ be able to prove that their system hasn't been broken, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;they _might_ be able to prove that it is _unlikely_ that it will be, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;they *CAN NOT* prove that it is unbreakable.  This is the nature of
&gt;&gt; &gt;cryptosystems.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Please prove your assertion.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If you can't prove this, and you can't find anybody else who has, why
&gt;&gt; should we believe it?
&gt;
&gt;Prove it?  Thats like saying "prove that the sun is bright on a sunny
&gt;day".  Its completely obvious.

In other words, you can't prove it.  Thought so.

&gt;If somebody has a new idea on how to attack their algorithm, it might
&gt;work.  Then the system will have been broken.  You never know when
&gt;somebody will come up with a new idea, so the best you can truthfully
&gt;say is "it hasn't been broken *YET*".  As I remember, this was mentioned
&gt;in more than one respected crypto book, including "Applied Cryptography"
&gt;(Schneier).

Page number?

Perhaps it would be helpful to hear a possible proof.  If somebody
were to show that breaking a certain cryptographic algorithm was
NP-complete, many people would find this almost as good as proof that
the algorithm is unbreakable.

Then if a clever person were to show that the NP-complete problems
were not solvable in any faster way than we presently know how, you
would have proof that a cryptographic algorithm was unbreakable.

There is no obvious reason why such a proof is not possible.
