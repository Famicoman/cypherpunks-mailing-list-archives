Dr. John Martin Grubor is the most harmless and most entertaining 
among all kooks.

His posting volume is a bit high, but other than that DrG never
got anyone in trouble.

&gt; 
&gt; For those who haven't explored the rich, sick history of John M. Grubor
&gt; (aka "aga@dhp.com"), he uses a variety of aliases.  While the "aga"
&gt; account seems popular right now, he usually pops over to another when his
&gt; killfile ratio gets too high.
&gt; 
&gt; To help save time and effort, the following is offered from the Grubor FAQ
&gt; that circulates on the Net with some regularity (look in 
&gt; alt.bonehead.john-grubor or alt.general.grubor):
&gt; 
&gt; Grubor has used, and continues to use, many aliases; usually through free
&gt; trial AOL, Prodigy or Compuserve accounts; but he has also paid for many
&gt; accounts on local providers. 
&gt; 
&gt; Some of Grubor's aliases: 
&gt; 
&gt; -manus@manus.org (his vanity domain)
&gt; -anything else at manus.org
&gt; -drg@telerama.lm.com (likely dead)    
&gt; -various pgh.org addresses (apparently another vanity account)
&gt; -Zeus (an usaor.net account, now dead)
&gt; -maryjane (a Compuserve address, dead)
&gt; -DrMacho (drmacho@pgh.nauticom.net, dead)
&gt; -Vwqe99b@prodigy.com (formerly using the alias "Amy Martin" now "Stanley
&gt;  Brown"; one of two accounts used for posting the infamous "List of
&gt;  Homosexuals in the Internet"--not dead, but rarely used) 
&gt; -Law Doctor or Doctor of Law used with his drg@manus.org and 
&gt;  drg@pgh.nauticom.net (dead) accounts
&gt; -two other AOL accounts--lawsystems@ and jgrubor@--are dead.
&gt; -aga@dhp.com (still active, but rarely used)
&gt; -zando@ix.netcom.com  (a former favorite, likely dead.  He used many
&gt; different  aliases with this one claiming alternately that this account
&gt; belongs to his mother and his wife.  All indications are that he is the
&gt; only one who used it.) 
&gt; 
&gt; He has also used CyberLawMaster, Lord Grubor, Lord Grub, and others with
&gt; his manus.org and ix.netcom.com addresses.  He morphs his aliases
&gt; frequently in an admitted attempt to foil killfiles. 
&gt; 
&gt; Possible aliases/morph accounts are:
&gt; -nancybett@aol.com (dead) 
&gt; 
&gt; All other accounts are generally verified as belonging to Grubor or not
&gt; rather quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;end FAQ extract&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; He is now also using "drgrubor@aol.com".  Because AOL will toss him fairly
&gt; quickly if he's too abusive (and he's already posting under that ID using
&gt; "cunt" and "cock" references), he'll probably not morph over there with
&gt; the idiocy he's been posting here.  If he does post from that account, I'd
&gt; suggest a mass mailing to AOL the moment it happens. 
&gt; 
&gt; He's got a KOTM award, but the small blurbs they publish don't do justice
&gt; to this small and pathetic little man.  He posts CONSTANTLY to the Usenet,
&gt; so checking things like DejaNews will help identify if it's really him
&gt; (his volume of posts seems to _never_ be what you'd call "lite").  His DHP
&gt; (DataHaven Project) domain is run by two hackers, Wipeout and Panzer Boy. 
&gt; Can't say anything based on fact, but I'd say that from their Web pages
&gt; that they aren't likely to really care what he says and aren't going to
&gt; respond to complaints sent to "postmaster@dhp.com".  If someone with
&gt; accurate info on who's selling line time to DHP can poney up a responsible
&gt; party to whom complaints can be sent, that might help. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, if we could just get this Grubor weenie hooked up with Helena Kobrin,
&gt; maybe they could cause some impossible "stupidity polarization" and set
&gt; off an implosion that will drive both of them straight to hell and forever
&gt; off the face of the Earth.  Where's Jim Bell when you need him?
