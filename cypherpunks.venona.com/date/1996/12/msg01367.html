Hi all,

MRTA is a bunch of terrorists, irrespective of whether the issues they are
trying to deal with are legitimate. They have threatened to kill people
if they don't get their way. This alone is enough for me to not support 
them. They also have taken their internal bitch outside their unhappy 
home and involved other nationalities. If they were my neighbors I would
call the cops and if allowed on the jury I would give them the max.

What I would suggest is that the Japanese take as many of the MRTA out
as they possibly can.

I support the Japanese. Screw the MRTA and the Peruvian government, little
Hitlers are little Hitlers.

Banzai!

                                                    Jim Choate

&gt; 
&gt; Companer@s,
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing this while I am tired and should be asleep, since I think that
&gt; this matter is too urgent to delay. I apologize for any careless
&gt; formulations.
&gt; 
&gt; By now, you all know that the Peruvian guerrilla group MRTA (Movimiento
&gt; Revolucionario Tupac Amaru) has occupied the mansion of the Japanese
&gt; ambassador in Lima and is holding several hundred prisoners. Unless you are
&gt; in an unusual part of the world, you also have seen how the bourgeois media
&gt; are discussing the matter as a problem of how to deal with 'terrorists.'
&gt; 
&gt; For the working people and all the oppressed and exploited of the world,
&gt; and for socialists, communists, and anarchists, the seizure of the
&gt; ambassador's residence along with about 400 bourgeois dinner guests is a
&gt; great accomplishment. It is a blow against the terrorism of the Peruvian
&gt; state and its imperialist patrons! Those captured in the raid include many
&gt; members of the Peruvian and international ruling elite, including the head
&gt; of Peru's secret police! It will be politically very difficult for the
&gt; Peruvian state to launch a military attack as a means of resolving the
&gt; crisis, since that would create quite a few 'illustrious corpses' and lead
&gt; to a falling out among bourgeois sectors.. (And it would be difficult to
&gt; get the world's poor majority to join the bourgeoisie in mourning its
&gt; dead!) It seems that there is already a falling out between Fujimori and
&gt; the Japanese over Fujimori's refusal, so far, to negotiate.
&gt; 
&gt; It is very important that the situation in Lima not be resolved in a way
&gt; that can be seen as a victory for the bourgeoisie. It is our task to
&gt; publicize who the real criminals are in Peru and to help wring concessions
&gt; from the Peruvian dictatorship. In particular, we should demand the release
&gt; of all political prisoners and prisoners of war from Peru's hideous
&gt; torture-chamber prisons. In this context, let's not get involved in
&gt; sectarian battles among the various factions of Peru's anti-government
&gt; left. Whatever differences the groups have, and these are very serious, we
&gt; must keep in mind that the Peruvian state and its imperialist backers (in
&gt; Washington, Tokyo, London, Bonn, etc.) are the main enemy. All political
&gt; prisoners must be released, whether of MRTA, the PCP (Shining Path) or
&gt; neither.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to the widespread publicity given to the events in Lima, many more
&gt; people will be interested in what we have to say about Peru than normally
&gt; would. Let's organize demonstrations at Peruvian Embassies, Consulates,
&gt; airline offices, etc. Let's raise our voices in whatever forum may be
&gt; available to defend the heroic guerrillas and to denounce the real
&gt; terrorists.
&gt; 
&gt; --In solidarity,
&gt; --Aaron &lt;aaron@burn.ucsd.edu&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. Plans are being made for a demonstration at the Peruvian Consulate in
&gt; San Francisco, California -- probably on Monday, December 23. If you live
&gt; in the area, please send me an e-mail message. Otherwise, do what you can
&gt; in your area!
