&gt; &gt;The problem is, people can choose what credit history they want to have
&gt; &gt;(I can be a saver or a spender, for example), but nobody can change the
&gt; &gt;color of their skin.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;This is central point of the theory why discrimination based on credit
&gt; &gt;histories is OK, while the discrimination based on race is not.
&gt; 
&gt; 	First, I would point out that redlining does not necessarily
&gt; equal credit discrimination based on race; it may mean credit
&gt; discrimination based on poverty, which has an unfortunately high
&gt; correlation with being a member of some races. (I won't go into the
&gt; explanations for why this is the case here; most people who try to
&gt; explain it don't take enough factors into account.)

Thanks for an interesting reply.

Do we consider discrimination based on poverty illegitimate?

Does the law consider discrimination based on poverty illegitimate?

I think that most people would answer no to both of these questions.

As I said in another letter, correlation, to me, is not an evidence
of discrimination, and just as well, making statements about averages is
not racist or sexist.

It is the cross-section test that evidences discrimination: suppose
we have two large groups with the same credit-related parameters
(credit history, etc). If one group gets better treatment from a
bank, I see a discrimination.

I do not see much problem if the percentage of whites with good credit
is higher than percentage of blacks with good credit: it is a fact of
life.

&gt; 	Second, let's take a look at whether inequalities based on
&gt; factors that people cannot change is something that is wrong. This
&gt; topic is wider in its application than redlining and credit; one
&gt; example important to me in my field is in genetic screening usage for
&gt; insurance purposes. (In that case, you've also got that limits on
&gt; insurance uses of data when individuals can gather the data in
&gt; question mean that someone can predict their own chances of needing
&gt; insurance... leading to those who are healthy not purchasing it,
&gt; and those who aren't purchasing it.)

The crucial question is: do we believe that the characteristic
that we are considering directly linked with future performance?

&gt; 	The first topic to mention in this regard is that of privacy.
&gt; I believe I am among most people in finding a question about my
&gt; behavior (e.g, my sexual activities) significantly more intrusive
&gt; than a question about my personal characteristics (e.g., my gender).
&gt; But I would hope that everyone would agree that it would be idiotic
&gt; and irresponsible not to have someone's payments for insurance vary
&gt; with their behavior; this would encourage irresponsible behavior and
&gt; discourage responsible behavior.
&gt; 	The second topic to mention in this regard is that inequality
&gt; due to factors one cannot change is a fact of life. This is particularly
&gt; true of capitalism (e.g., someone who has a genetic tendency toward
&gt; large size will consume more food and thus spend more money on food),
&gt; but it is also a problem in any other economic system - economics is
&gt; not all of life. Even if one concludes that inequality is wrongful and
&gt; needs to be "alleviated", there are many areas more important than
&gt; credit on which one would logically start... such as forbidding
&gt; merit-based admissions, which are biased in favor of those with higher
&gt; IQs. I trust that my audience sees exactly why this idea, and similar
&gt; ideas, are ultimately nonsense?

This is a valid concern.

&gt; 	The third topic is that one commonly applied idea used by the
&gt; proponents of absolute equality is that found in Rawls' _Theory of
&gt; Justice_, under which the just outcome is said to be found by a group
&gt; of people who do not know what situation they will be in. (This is
&gt; a vast oversimplification of the book(s) in question, which upon
&gt; closer examination may realize the idea I am about to write down.)
&gt; The simplistic conclusion is that everyone will want everything to be

&gt; the same, since any individual might be in a bad or good situation. But
&gt; if you have a choice between 49 dollars and a 50/50 chance of 0 or 100
&gt; dollars, you should take the latter. In other words, a situation in

Not necessarily.
