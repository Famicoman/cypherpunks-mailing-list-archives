| &gt;&gt;&gt;  A friend of mine from UT passed this story onto me from the "Daily
| &gt;&gt;&gt;  Texan" - the University of Texas newspaper. Apparently it occured
| &gt;&gt;&gt;  during Fall Premier -- a UT tradition that is a celebration of the
| &gt;&gt;&gt;  end of midterms.
| &gt;&gt;&gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"Reason to not party anymore"-
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This guy went out last Saturday night to a party.  He was having a
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;good time, had a couple  of beers and some girl seemed to like him
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and invited him to go to another party.  He quickly agreed and
| &gt;decided
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to go along with her.  She took him to a party in some apartment
| &gt;and
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;they continued to drink, and even got involved with some other
| &gt;drugs
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;(unknown which).
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The next thing he knew, he woke up completely naked in a bathtub
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;filled with ice.  He was still feeling the effects of the drugs,
| &gt;but
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;looked around to see he was alone.
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;He looked down at his chest, which had "CALL 911 OR YOU WILL DIE"
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;written on it in lipstick.  He saw a phone was on a stand next to
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the tub, so he picked it up and dialed.  He explained to the EMS
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;operator what the situation was and that he didn't know where he
| &gt;was,
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;what he took, or why he was really calling.  She advised him to get
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;out of the tub.  He did, and she asked him to look himself over in
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the mirror.  He did, and appeared normal, so she told him to check
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;his back.  He did, only to find two 9 inch slits on his lower back.
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;She told him to get back in the tub immediately, and they sent a
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;rescue team over.
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Apparently, after being examined, he found out more of what had
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;happened.  His kidneys were stolen.  They are worth 10,000 dollars
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;each on the black market.  (I was unaware this even existed.)
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Several guesses are in order:
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The second party was a sham, the people involved had to be at least
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;medical students, and it was not just recreational drugs  he was
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;given.
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Regardless, he is currently in the  hospital on life  support,
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;awaiting a spare kidney. The University of Texas in conjunction
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with Baylor University Medical Center is conducting tissue research
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to match the sophomore student with a donor.
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Any information leading to the arrest of the individuals may be
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;forwarded to the University of Texas Campus police, or the Texas
| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Rangers.
