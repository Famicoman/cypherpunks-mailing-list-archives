I find it highly amusing how John "asshole censor" Gilmore claims credit
for himself and his discredited EFF, as if they had anything to do with
Patel's ruling.

What a maroon.

&gt; San Francisco - On Monday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel struck down Cold War
&gt; export restrictions on the privacy technology called cryptography.  Her
&gt; decision knocks out a major part of the Clinton Administration's
&gt; effort to force companies to build "wiretap-ready" computers,
&gt; set-top boxes, telephones, and consumer electronics.
&gt;
&gt; The decision is a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the
&gt; prevention of crime.  American scientists and engineers will now be
&gt; free to collaborate with their peers in the United States and in other
&gt; countries.  This will enable them to build a new generation of tools
&gt; for protecting the privacy and security of communications.
&gt;
&gt; The Clinton Administration has been using the export restrictions to goad
&gt; companies into building wiretap-ready "key recovery" technology.  In a
&gt; November Executive Order, President Clinton offered limited
&gt; administrative exemptions from these restrictions to companies which
&gt; agree to undermine the privacy of their customers.  Federal District
&gt; Judge Patel's ruling knocks both the carrot and the stick out of
&gt; Clinton's hand, because the restrictions were unconstitutional in the
&gt; first place.
&gt;
&gt; The Cold War law and regulations at issue in the case prevented
&gt; American researchers and companies from exporting cryptographic
&gt; software and hardware.  Export is normally thought of as the physical
&gt; carrying of an object across a national border.  However, the
&gt; regulations define "export" to include simple publication in the U.S.,
&gt; as well as discussions with foreigners inside the U.S.  They also define
&gt; "software" to include printed English-language descriptions and
&gt; diagrams, as well as the traditional machine-readable object code and
&gt; human-readable source code.
&gt;
&gt; The secretive National Security Agency has built up an arcane web of
&gt; complex and confusing laws, regulations, standards, and secret
&gt; interpretations for years.  These are used to force, persuade, or
&gt; confuse individuals, companies, and government departments into making
&gt; it easy for NSA to wiretap and decode all kinds of communications.
&gt; Their tendrils reach deep into the White House, into numerous Federal
&gt; agencies, and into the Congressional Intelligence Committees.  In
&gt; recent years this web is unraveling in the face of increasing
&gt; visibility, vocal public disagreement with the spy agency's goals,
&gt; commercial and political pressure, and judicial scrutiny.
&gt;
&gt; Civil libertarians have long argued that encryption should be widely
&gt; deployed on the Internet and throughout society to protect privacy,
&gt; prove the authenticity of transactions, and improve computer security.
&gt; Industry has argued that the restrictions hobble them in building
&gt; secure products, both for U.S. and worldwide use, risking America's
&gt; current dominant position in computer technology.  Government
&gt; officials in the FBI and NSA argue that the technology is too
&gt; dangerous to permit citizens to use it, because it provides privacy to
&gt; criminals as well as ordinary citizens.
&gt;
&gt; "We're pleased that Judge Patel understands that our national security
&gt; requires protecting our basic rights of free speech and privacy," said
&gt; John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
&gt; backed the suit.  "There's no sense in `burning the Constitution in
&gt; order to save it'.  The secretive bureaucrats who have restricted these
&gt; rights for decades in the name of national security must come to a
&gt; larger understanding of how to support and preserve our democracy."
&gt;
&gt; 	Reactions to the decision
&gt;
&gt; "This is a positive sign in the crypto wars -- the first rational
&gt; statement concerning crypto policy to come out of any part of the
&gt; government," said Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security, one of
&gt; the companies most affected by crypto policy.
&gt;
&gt; "It's nice to see that the executive branch does not get to decide
&gt; whether we have the right of free speech," said Philip Zimmermann,
&gt; Chairman of PGP, Inc.  "It shows that my own common sense
&gt; interpretation of the constitution was correct five years ago when I
&gt; thought it was safe to publish my own software, PGP.  If only US
&gt; Customs had seen it that way."  Mr. Zimmermann is a civil libertarian
&gt; who was investigated by the government under these laws when he wrote
&gt; and gave away a program for protecting the privacy of e-mail.  His
&gt; "Pretty Good Privacy" program is used by human rights activists
&gt; worldwide to protect their workers and informants from torture and
&gt; murder by their own countries' secret police.
&gt;
&gt; "Judge Patel's decision furthers our efforts to enable secure electronic
&gt; commerce," said Asim Abdullah, executive director of CommerceNet.
&gt;
&gt; Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and
&gt; Technology, a Washington-based Internet advocacy group, hailed the
&gt; victory.  "The Bernstein ruling illustrates that the Administration
&gt; continues to embrace an encryption policy that is not only unwise, but
&gt; also unconstitutional.  We congratulate Dan Bernstein, the Electronic
&gt; Frontier Foundation, and all of the supporters who made this victory
&gt; for free speech and privacy on the Internet possible."
&gt;
&gt; "The ability to publish is required in any vibrant academic discipline,"
&gt; This ruling re-affirming our obvious academic right will help American
&gt; researchers publish without worrying," said Bruce Schneier, author of
&gt; the popular textbook _Applied Cryptography_, and a director of the
&gt; International Association for Cryptologic Research, a professional
&gt; organization of cryptographers.
&gt;
&gt; Kevin McCurley, President of the International Association for
&gt; Cryptologic Research, said, "Basic research to further the
&gt; understanding of fundamental notions in information should be welcomed
&gt; by our society.  The expression of such work is closely related to one
&gt; of the fundamental values of our society, namely freedom of speech."
&gt;
&gt; 	Effect of the decision
&gt;
&gt; Judge Patel's decision today only legally applies to Prof. Bernstein.
&gt; Other people and companies are still technically required to follow
&gt; the export restrictions when speaking or publishing about
&gt; cryptography, or when speaking or publishing cryptographic source
&gt; code.  However, the decision sends a strong signal that if the
&gt; government tried to enforce these rules against other people, the
&gt; courts are likely to strike them down again.
&gt;
&gt; Judge Patel has specifically not decided whether the export controls
&gt; on object code (the executable form of computer programs which source
&gt; code is automatically translated into) are constitutional.  Existing
&gt; export controls will continue to apply to runnable software products,
&gt; such as Netscape's broswer, until another court case challenges that
&gt; part of the restrictions.
&gt;
&gt; 	Background on the case
&gt;
&gt; The plaintiff in the case, Daniel J. Bernstein, Research Assistant
&gt; Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, developed an
&gt; "encryption algorithm" (a recipe or set of instructions) that he
&gt; wanted to publish in printed journals as well as on the Internet.
&gt; Bernstein sued the government, claiming that the government's
&gt; requirements that he register as an arms dealer and seek government
&gt; permission before publication was a violation of his First Amendment
&gt; right of free speech.  This is required by the Arms Export Control Act
&gt; and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
&gt; Regulations.
&gt;
&gt; In the first phase of this litigation, the government argued that
&gt; since Bernstein's ideas were expressed, in part, in computer language
&gt; (source code), they were not protected by the First Amendment.  On
&gt; April 15, 1996, Judge Patel rejected that argument and held for the
&gt; first time that computer source code is protected speech for purposes
&gt; of the First Amendment.
&gt;
&gt; 	Details of Monday's Decision
&gt;
&gt; Judge Patel ruled that the Arms Export Control Act is an
&gt; unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, because it requires
&gt; Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for
&gt; review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from
&gt; the government a license to publish his ideas.  Using the Pentagon
&gt; Papers case as precedent, she ruled that the government's "interest of
&gt; national security alone does not justify a prior restraint." Under the
&gt; Constitution, he is now free to publish his ideas without asking the
&gt; government's permission first.
&gt;
&gt; Judge Patel also held that the government's required licensing
&gt; procedure fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.  When the
&gt; Government acts legally to suppress protected speech, it must reduce
&gt; the chance of illegal censorship by the bureacrats involved.  Her
&gt; decision states, "Because the ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide
&gt; for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicial review
&gt; and for a duty on the part of the ODTC to go to court and defend a
&gt; denial of a license, the ITAR licensing scheme as applied to Category
&gt; XIII(b) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the
&gt; First Amendment."
&gt;
&gt; She also ruled that the export controls restrict speech based on the
&gt; content of the speech, not for any other reason.  "Category XIII(b) is
&gt; directed very specifically at applied scientific research and speech on
&gt; the topic of encryption."  The Government had argued that it restricts
&gt; the speech because of its function, not its content.
&gt;
&gt; The judge also found that the ITAR is vague, because it does not
&gt; adequately define how information that is available to the public
&gt; "through fundamental research in science and engineering" is exempt
&gt; from the export restrictions.  "This subsection ...  does not give
&gt; people ... a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited." The
&gt; failure to precisely define what objects and actions are being
&gt; regulated creates confusion and a chilling effect.  Bernstein has been
&gt; unable to publish his encryption algorithm for over three years.  Many
&gt; other cryptographers and ordinary programmers have also been restrained
&gt; from publishing because of the vagueness of the ITAR.  Brian
&gt; Behlendorf, a maintainer of the popular public domain "Apache" web
&gt; server program, stated, "No cryptographic source code was ever
&gt; distributed by the Apache project.  Despite this, the Apache server
&gt; code was deemed by the NSA to violate the ITAR."  Judge Patel also
&gt; adopted a narrower definition of the term "defense service" in order to
&gt; save it from unconstitutional vagueness.
&gt;
&gt; The immediate effect of this decision is that Bernstein now is free to
&gt; teach his January 13th cryptography class in his usual way.  He can
&gt; post his class materials on the Internet, and discuss the upcoming
&gt; class's materials with other professors, without being held in
&gt; violation of the ITAR.  "I'm very pleased," Bernstein said.  "Now I
&gt; won't have to tell my students to burn their notebooks."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ABOUT THE ATTORNEYS
&gt;
&gt; Lead counsel on the case is Cindy Cohn of the San Mateo law firm of
&gt; McGlashan &amp; Sarrail, who is offering her services pro bono.  Major
&gt; additional pro bono legal assistance is being provided by Lee Tien of
&gt; Berkeley; M. Edward Ross of the San Francisco law firm of Steefel,
&gt; Levitt &amp; Weiss; James Wheaton and Elizabeth Pritzker of the First
&gt; Amendment Project in Oakland; and Robert Corn-Revere of the
&gt; Washington, DC, law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION
&gt;
&gt; The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a nonprofit civil
&gt; liberties organization working in the public interest to protect
&gt; privacy, free expression, and access to online resources and
&gt; information.  EFF is a primary sponsor of the Bernstein case.  EFF
&gt; helped to find Bernstein pro bono counsel, is a member of the
&gt; Bernstein legal team, and helped collect members of the academic
&gt; community and computer industry to support this case.
