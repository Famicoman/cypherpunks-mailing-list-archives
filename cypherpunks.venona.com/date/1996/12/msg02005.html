&gt;&gt;This is the message I got in response to my post regarding Mr. May's
&gt;&gt;offensive, racist, and bigoted post about ebonics.  I have made
&gt;&gt;overtures towards peace and tried to explain that I thought that the
&gt;&gt;Doctor's verbal slapping was not as bad as it seemed, maybe even he
&gt;&gt;deserved it!.  He refuses to answer.  He's just a pussy, I guess.
&gt;&gt;Like's to make terroristic threats.  To Nam vets, yet.  Ballsy, Tim!
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for playing, Mr. Grubor. Please pick up your consolation prize at
&gt;the door marked "Out." And stop passing Dimbulb the mailing list messages --
&gt;you know it makes the tumors in his head kick in.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I would rather have discussed this with you in private e-mail, or
&gt;&gt;over a few beers, but you refuse to answer my e-mail.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe he has you filtered, as the rest of us will now.
&gt;
&gt;*plonk*

Indeed, I added "Ross Wright" to my Eudora filter file after his "slap you
around" message several days ago, so I was mercifully spared from reading
whatever he sent to me (as he claims today). After seeing the messsages
from you, Blanc, and Sandy, who are _not_ filtered, I checked my Trash
folder before emptying it and saw Wright's posting of my private mail to
him.

His claim to "slap me around" means I'll treat him as a hostile agent.

As to why he got *plonked*, this is the price people pay for writing such
things as "maybe we need to slap him around." I have more than 20 in my
filter file now, though many of these are of people who are no longer
spewing on the CP list, for whatever reasons.

Oh, and posting private mail is not considered acceptable behavior.

&gt;(I'd prob'ly buy him the hollowpoints, btw.)

Thanks, but I'm well-stocked on Golden Sabers, and even some Black Talons
(though they were overrated, from studies I've seen).
