&gt; transaction to evade the reporting requirements is a violation of this
&gt; subsection, and 31 U.S.C. 5322(a) says that a willful violation is a
&gt; five-year felony.  Oh, and willful violation while violating another U.S.
&gt; law is a ten-year felony until 5322(b).  I'd suspect the guy was looking at
&gt; a 5322(b) charge (with "transmission of wagering information in interstate

Your answer looks pretty good to me (although I must admit I didn't pull the 
statute once I saw that you replied to Bell's post).  Except that we 
didn't consider a 5322(b) charge for various reasons.

The reason which we were unhappy with our IRS agents is that structuring 
is hard to sell to a jury in a vacuum.  If you can explain the reason for 
the structuring by, for example, adding a tax charge, the structuring 
charge is much easier to understand as something that is "wrong" within 
our system of laws.

In other words, he committed the crime but it would have been more 
difficult to prove BRD at trial than if the IRS hadn't messed up.  The 
target, who is a lawyer, wanted to resolve the matter without a trial if 
possible to avoid risking incarceration and loss of his law license.

Remember, Jim, he AGREED to the disposition.  While represented by one of 
the best criminal defense lawyers in our jurisdiction (since deceased).

Since that case, the Supreme Court has made it more difficult to succeed 
in such prosecutions by toughening the knowledge requirement.  That would 
not have help the gambling attorney, because he had previously been 
involved in transactions where CTRs were filed and knew of the regs.
