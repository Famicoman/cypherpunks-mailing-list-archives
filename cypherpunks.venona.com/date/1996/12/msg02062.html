Given the current discussion of possibile GAK legislation, you may
want to check out the session from last March's Computers, Freedom,
and Privacy Conference on outlawing non-escrowed encryption.

We invented a manadatory GAK law "Cryptography Control Act of 1995"
and debated its constitutionality in a mock "Supreme Court" hearing
before a panel of real fedreral judges.  The briefs and the oral
arguments (available on the Web in RealAudio format) are an excellent
source on questions of whether mandatory GAK would be constitutional.

The text of the web page is attached below.  The actual page has links
an extensive set of documents.

By the way, watch for the announcement for CFP97, which will be held
March 11-14 in Burlingame, CA.

Looming over the controversies surrounding the Digital Telephony
Legislation, the Clipper Chip proposal, and the criminal investigation of
PGP, is the shadow of perhaps the most critical issue of them all:

     Will Americans be prohibited from ensuring the privacy of their
     communications, including preserving those communications against
     government intrusion? Will strong, non-escrowed encryption be
     outlawed, and those who use it subjected to criminal prosecution?

CFP96, in co-sponsorship with the American Bar Association, Criminal Justice
Section, presented a moot Court highlighting this question. The format was
that of a Supreme Court argument, where former federal prosecutors argued
against noted civil liberties lawyers before a panel of five federal judges.
A second panel, comprised of regional law school professors, served as a
shadow court and rendered a written judgment on the case.

The issue being tested was whether an individual, who has successfully used
outlawed encryption to hide his conversations while the target of a criminal
investigation, can be prosecuted and convicted for use of unauthorized
encryption under the (fictional) "Cryptography Control Act of 1995".

The background for this session assumed that the defendant's conviction was
upheld 2-1 in an appeals court decision, whose majority opinion and
dissenting opinion set forth the central Constitutonal arguments for
upholding, or overturning, the prohibition of unauthorized encryption. At
the CFP session, the Court reviewed the decision and the shadow court
overturned it, rendering a majority opinion and a concurring opinion.
