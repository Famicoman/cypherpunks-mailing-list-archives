	I said expects, not wants.  The NSA knows that Skipjack is a
fat target, and probably, despite efforts at hardening it, a soft
target as well.  So they took steps to make it tough, but probably
expect that those efforts will fail.

	Bruce Schneier gave a talk 2 years ago at the Crypto rump
session where he talked about 'Open Source Skipjack.'  The talk notes
may be on the web.

	I know that.  I honestly don't think it would be a sufficient
propaganda victory to break through the 'tamper-resistant' housing and
reverse engineer the algorithim to make it worth the loss of respect
for 'revealing national security codes.'

	The big losers would be the smartcard folks.  Its not clear to
me that 'cypherpunks' would get more positive PR than negative.
