&gt; &gt;Exact effective range / altitude is not listed in the quick guide I have

&gt; 
&gt; When I was doing my undergraduate work several of us built a heat-seeking
&gt; and homing circuit which we subsequently tested in a small (24-inch) solid
&gt; propellent rocket.  Four CO-2 cooled germanium sensors picked up radiation
&gt; from a small flat-topped piramidal mirror which drove fin servos to 'null'
&gt; onto (place its image atop the piramid) the heat source. One evening we
&gt; were able to 'shoot down' a lit cigarette tied to fence up in the hills
&gt; near the college from a distance of about 1/4-mile.
&gt; 
&gt; For some time we considered making available 'Visible Missile" plans/kits,
&gt; for a  few hundred dollars, which had everything except the easily obtained
&gt; zinc-sulphur propellent (would this be illegal given the laws passed since
&gt; the '70s?) so those interested in IR missile technology could learn from a
&gt; functioning testbed.  I did quite a bit of serious amateur rocketry in my

very interesting.

how to make this propellent?

and why it was banned?

thanks!

death to zealous "child protectors".

&gt; teen years through the Northrup Rocketry Club (So. Cal) and launches at a
&gt; site near Edwards AFB (they were happy to track our launches and make sure
&gt; there was no aircraft hazzard). Our 24-inch rockets reached speeds of over
&gt; 1000 mph in about 1 second and altitudes of about 10,000 ft.  48-inch

khm, it means that the acceleration was 45g. it is a lot, how come
the rockets did not break apart? what were the rocket bodies made
from?

&gt; rockets (still small enough for shoulder launch) could reach over Mach 2
&gt; and altitude/ranges of about 50,000 ft (all figures insignificant
&gt; payloads).

&gt; I'm certain I and many of my friends got much of our interest for math and
&gt; science and subsequent academic success from such hands-on activities which
&gt; were encouraged or supported by teachers, parents, corporations and the
&gt; government.  We were forced to solve real chemistry, math, engineering,
&gt; physics and material science problems.  This has all vanished is our zeal
&gt; to protect youth and society from any activity which might lead injury or
&gt; misuse.  I can't even find a place to buy a niece a real chemistry set as
&gt; tort laws have forced them from the market.  When considering the plumeting
&gt; interest and achievement of our youth in math and science we look nor
&gt; further for a reason.

of course, protection leads to stupidification.

is this rocketry club still operational?
