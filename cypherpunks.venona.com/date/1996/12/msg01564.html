&gt; poor timmy laments that no one responded to his latest
&gt; gedanken masterpiece. I am very pleased to be the one to
&gt; relieve him of his loneliness.

I think Timmy mentioned something about a tryst with Gilmore (spit).
Is that why the coward has quiesced posting his tripe to this list?
Would it be more appropriate to put (swallow) rather than (spit)
after Gilmore's name?
How much proeteins, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamines are contained
in an average human ejaculation?
What about farm animals'?
Timmy (fart) and John (swallow) can tell us a lot about this subject.

&gt; Timmy writes:
&gt; &gt;Fortunately for the bulk of us, the likely number of deaths and economic
&gt; &gt;losses from such crimes of kidnapping, extortion, and even murder for hire,
&gt; &gt;is still likely to be vastly lower than the number of deaths caused by
&gt; &gt;powerful central governments enriching themselves and their cronies with
&gt; &gt;foreign wars. Not to mention the deaths in the Drug War, the lives wasted
&gt; &gt;in other interferences in private behavior, etc.
&gt;
&gt; imho, it's a very warped kind of mind that insinuates some evil is no
&gt; big deal because greater evils exist in the world.

Yes, Timmy May is one sick motherfucker.

&gt; it's an argument I see often among the libertarians
&gt; around here. "what's the big deal
&gt; about murder? govt's do it all the time. everyone should be able to
&gt; murder anyone if govt's do it. why, the right to
&gt; murder people is an inalienable right!!". of course the arguments
&gt; are never made in this language-- the fun is spotting it in the
&gt; rhetoric.

Of course Timmy May is a coward. Despite his boasting about his
assault weapons collection, he probably doesn't have the balls
to ice a mouse caught in a mousetrap. Timmy is probably so femme,
he wails like a banshee and asks whoever he sleeps with that day
to take the mouse out.

&gt; &gt;This is why I look forward to this Brave New World of fully untraceable
&gt; &gt;communications and fully untraceable economic transactions.
&gt;
&gt; ah, an even more warped mind that not merely condones it but
&gt; "looks forward to it"
&gt;
&gt; careful, timmy, your slime is showing!!

It's been showing for a while. Timmy May has been exposed on this list
as a coward, a liar, a racist, and an all-around scumbag.

&gt; (it would be fun to debate you publicly some day on your true beliefs, but
&gt; alas, you never bite. oh well, I stay amused well enough..)

Like I said, Timmy May is a coward.
