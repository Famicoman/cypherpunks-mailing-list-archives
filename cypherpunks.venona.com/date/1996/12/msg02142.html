&gt; &gt; Just in case someone replies saying "It's not all that bad", or "It can't
&gt; &gt; happen here", etc., you should know this:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The United States government has not been responsive to the people for
&gt; &gt; a long time, but what's become evident in recent years is that they're
&gt; &gt; also no longer responsive to basic law and order.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They do respond to extreme pressure, as was applied in the Weaver, Waco,
&gt; &gt; and other similar cases, but, as a general rule, they do whatever they
&gt; &gt; want all the way to the top of the Justice dept. with impunity.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Example:  George Bush's old pal at the Wash. DC P.R. firm hires the
&gt; &gt; niece(?) of a Kuwaiti official to testify in front of Congress in full
&gt; &gt; view of the American people on television, that the Iraquis were throwing
&gt; &gt; babies out of incubators in Kuwait, thereby securing the necessary votes
&gt; &gt; in Congress to prosecute the Gulf War.

At that time the country was already at war and if you read the war powers
act and look at the dates, you'll find that he probably could have
prosecuted it without congress.

60 minutes did a nice piece on this, BTW, and even they admitted that the
wool might have been pulled over the eyes of the Bush Staff.

&gt; &gt; When it was discovered (after the "war") that the Incubator Baby Scandal
&gt; &gt; was a lie, nobody was prosecuted.

Prosecuted for what?

&gt; &gt; Further, in blatant violation of the
&gt; &gt; U.S. Constitution, Bush and Schwartzkopf were knighted by Queen Elizabeth
&gt; &gt; II of England.

Careful.  The knighthoods in question (Knight's Cross of the Victorian
Order if I recall) do not infringe on foreign decorations restrictions
when they are granted in an honorary context, as both were - again if my
recall is correct.

Several American citizens have been inducted into foreign orders of merit
and some have been inducted into badge and even sash orders.

One noteable was even inducted into the Order of the Bath (extra points
for the name of said citizen).

&gt; &gt; There are also numerous examples of the Justice dept. being caught red-
&gt; &gt; handed forging documents to frame people for whom they had no evidence or
&gt; &gt; insufficient evidence to prosecute, and what happens in those cases?
&gt; &gt; Nothing.

Examples...?
