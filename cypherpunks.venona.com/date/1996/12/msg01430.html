&gt; I note that along with this racist generalisation you decided to post the

"Generalisation"? It's a historical fact that Armenians have murdered
2,500,000 Turks, Kurds, and Sephardic Jews in this century alone.

Next you'll say that Germans didn't kill 6 million Jews. (Of course, the
Nizkor project now claims that Germans killed 12 million Jews. Isn't
it remarkable how fast those pesky dead Jews can multiply? :-)

&gt; following rant:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;As usual, Timmy May spouts racist, anti-Semitic shit. As usual, he has
&gt; &gt;no idea what he's talking about. So what else is new...
&gt;
&gt; As well as a number of other rants along those lines. There is little
&gt; difference between over generalisations of the kind you made above
&gt; and, for example, discriminating against someone on the basis of
&gt; race, colour, religion etc.

Interesting. Paul Bradley does not consider Timmy May's (fart) latest rants
on "ebonics" and "colored race" to be racist? I think Timmy May hates
blacks even more than he hates Jews. Let's quote Timmy's sick garbage on
soc.culture.african.american and ask if they find it offensive and racist.
