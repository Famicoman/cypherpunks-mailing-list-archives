&gt; &gt;So what you're saying is I (or we) can testify in front of Congress on
&gt; &gt;essentially any topic, telling a blatant lie (that we know is false, and
&gt; &gt;which they will subsequently prove is false), and totally get away with
&gt; &gt;it.  You and I can do that, is that what you're saying?

&gt; This is idiotic. I suspect it's deliberately idiotic, but I can't see what
&gt; anyone gains by it. If you've got a point to make, would you please just
&gt; say what you're thinking and move on?

See below.

&gt; There's a big difference between something being punishable and someone
&gt; being punished. The false testimony was given on behalf of a friendly
&gt; government, and in favor of a cause which met with widespread national
&gt; support and was the focus of much (literal) flag-waving and patriotic
&gt; speechifying. In general, you face very few risks if you lie in a way which
&gt; helps a very popular cause, and the people you're lying to want to do the
&gt; thing that your lies are purportedly justifying. Your risks are much
&gt; greater if you're saying something unpopular or if you are an unpopular
&gt; person. I'm not talking about law, I'm talking about politics. And the fact
&gt; that laws are sometimes enforced in a political matter shouldn't be news to
&gt; anyone. (I'm not saying that's good, but I think it's attributable to and a
&gt; result of to the general fallibility of human beings, myself included, so
&gt; I'm skeptical about easy answers. Real-world solutions tend to fall short
&gt; of theoretical perfection. Doh.)

&gt; &gt;If that is true, then my original contention that things are far worse
&gt; &gt;than the person I originally responded to was imagining, stands as
&gt; &gt;correct.  Things are bad indeed.

&gt; I'd sure appreciate it if you'd just say what you're thinking (if it's
&gt; on-topic) instead of playing stupid "Is X true? Is Y true? Wow! I've just
&gt; discovered something new!" games. Your comments suggest to me that what
&gt; you're dancing around is, essentially, that the government is morally wrong
&gt; because it (eliding distinctions between governments and branches of
&gt; governments) enforces laws in an erratic or discriminatory or political
&gt; fashion. That's what I'm extracting from your messages. If there's
&gt; something more to what you're saying, I think I'd have a better chance of
&gt; extracting it if you devoted less energy to tricky rhetorical strategies.

I sympathize.  My original posting was short and clear.  This is what
happens when people who don't think as clearly as you do (sadly, a
majority of c-punks) respond to a posting with deliberately twisted
logic to "refute" a point.  See Black Unicorn's recent posts about
denial of service for an excellent example of this.
