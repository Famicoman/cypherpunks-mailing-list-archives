I hardly want to be known as the champion of welfare, despite my recent
posts ;-( I wonder, however, if these figures are to some large extent a
result of health care benefits (presumedly) being paid for whereas
ordinary folk in the states do not get such access.

Assuming these figures are accurate, there does appear to be a problem!
While I do believe that most people would rather work than not, there
really should not be any financial incentive to chose welfare over
honest work. FWIW, I don't *believe* these figures are representative of
Canadian welfare roles as we all get (more or less) free health care to
begin with, something I and most Canadians are proud of.

(Once again, I am back on cypherpunks talking about non-crypt related
subjects. This is my last public posting on this subject.)

cheers, kinch

&gt; 
&gt; The numbers quoted in the press were based on a study by the Cato Institute,
&gt; "The Work Welfare Trade-Off: An Analysis of the Total Level of Welfare
&gt; Benefits by the State" by Michael Tanner, Stephen Moore, and David Hartman,
&gt; September, 1995.  It's at 
&gt; &lt;<A  HREF="http://www.cato.org/research/pr-nd-st.html">http://www.cato.org/research/pr-nd-st.html</A>&gt;.  
&gt; 
&gt; Extracts: 
&gt; 
&gt; * To match the value of welfare benefits, a mother with two children would
&gt; have to earn as much as $36,400 in Hawaii or as little as $11,500 in
&gt; Mississippi.
&gt; 
&gt; * In New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, the District of Columbia,
&gt; Hawaii, Alaska, and Rhode Island, welfare pays more than a $12.00-an-hour
&gt; job--or more than two and a half times the minimum wage. 
&gt; 
&gt; * In 40 states welfare pays more than an $8.00-an-hour job. In 17 states
&gt; the welfare package is more generous than a $10.00-an-hour job.
&gt; 
&gt; * Welfare benefits are especially generous in large cities. Welfare
&gt; provides the equivalent of an hourly pretax wage of $14.75 in New York
&gt; City, $12.45 in Philadelphia, $11.35 in Baltimore, and $10.90 in Detroit.
&gt;             
&gt; * In 9 states welfare pays more than the average first-year salary for a
&gt; teacher. In 29 states it pays more than the average starting salary for a
&gt; secretary. In 47 states welfare pays more than a janitor earns. Indeed, in
&gt; the 6 most generous states, benefits exceed the entry-level salary for a
&gt; computer programmer.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I am not in a position to argue with you, I simply don't have the facts.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;My question is, do You? can you cite where this figure came from, it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;sounds like Republican rhetoric to me. Of course, I will point out, that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;minimum wage is simply not enough to feed a family. It is (or at least
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it should be) reserved for single folks just starting out.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Can't give you the exact date, but it was an article in our local paper (The
&gt; &gt;&gt;Detroit News).  The $10 figure is not exact, as the actual number varies
&gt; &gt;&gt;from state to state, I remember that number as being about average.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I can confirm the gist of Clay's point: I saw a table listing "effective
&gt; &gt;hourly welfare pay" for the 50 states and D.C. This was in the "San Jose
&gt; &gt;Mercury News," at least 8-10 months ago (and presumably elsewhere, as it
&gt; &gt;was a major story). I used it in one of my articles, and gave the reference
&gt; &gt;then (sorry, not handy, and my own welfare rate does not pay me enough to
&gt; &gt;spend hours sifting through past articles for something so minor, an old
&gt; &gt;cite, that is).
