&gt; &gt;&gt;files his taxes.  He reports the payment, as is ostensibly legally required. 
&gt; &gt;&gt; He paid the taxes owed.  Period."
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;THEN you said, "we settled the matter."   Huh?  What, exactly, was there to 
&gt; &gt;&gt;"settle"?  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Why, of course, the fact that the guy attempted to structure the
&gt; &gt;transaction to evade the reporting requirements in the first place.  31
&gt; &gt;U.S.C. 5324(a). 
&gt; 
&gt; Who says?  He eventually reported it within the legally-defined time.  The 
&gt; evidence of intent to COMPLY with the law is far stronger than the evidence 
&gt; of the opposite.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Structuring (or attempting to structure) a financial
&gt; &gt;transaction to evade the reporting requirements is a violation of this
&gt; &gt;subsection, and 31 U.S.C. 5322(a) says that a willful violation is a
&gt; &gt;five-year felony.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, he clearly DID NOT "evade the reporting requirement."  Brian Davis 
&gt; admitted this. (Whether he ever intended to do this is sheer speculation on 
&gt; the part of anyone else.  We'll never know; as Davis pointed out, the IRS 
&gt; screwed up.)   Even if the standard of evidence was as low as "preponderance 
&gt; of evidence" (which it, of course, is not in a criminal case) he SHOULD have 
&gt; won.  By waiting until the return was filed and the tax was paid, the IRS 
&gt; was allowing him to resolve whatever ambiguity remained.

You misunderstand what the statute intends.  The violation is for 
attempting to evade *the bank's* requirement to report certain 
transactions (i.e. &gt;$10K).  He structured the transaction in an effort to 
keep the bank from complying with the law.


 
&gt; Actually, if there were any justice, he should have been able to sue the 
&gt; bank for reporting him and NOT INFORMING HIM of that fact.  (I presume the 
&gt; law requires the bank to report suspicious transactions.  I also presume 
&gt; that the law _doesn't_ prohibit the bank from telling the customer that it 
&gt; will have to report that transaction.)  The bank, presumably being experts 
&gt; in the matter, recognizes that lay individuals can't be expected to be experts 
&gt; in specialized areas, and should be considered obligated to warn customers 
&gt; away from suspicious-looking transactions.  I'm sure the REAL LAWYERS (tm) 
&gt; on this list will be able to cite examples of where experts of all kinds 
&gt; were sued by non-experts for failing to warn them of unexpected dangers that 
&gt; could have been averted had the appropriate advice been given promptly.
&gt; 
So you want the bank to be your nanny?  The guy is a lawyer and had 
previously been involved in transactions in which such reports had been 
filed.  What is your explanation for the three 3 $9k check request?
