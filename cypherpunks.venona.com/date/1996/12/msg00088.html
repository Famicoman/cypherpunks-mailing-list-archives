A new ALPHA release of the Systemics Cryptix crypto library for Java is
now available for download at <A  HREF="http://www.systemics.com/software/">http://www.systemics.com/software/</A>

The library is FREE FOR COMMERCIAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE.

This release of the library is only intended for serious developers,
who are prepared to work with a moving API.

Differences from the previous release are that the library is now 100%
Java, although native code can still be loaded if the libraries are
present (which is unlikely, since I haven't completed them yet :-)
Also, PGP classes have now been incorportated into the library.

And of course, all the source is available (in fact, that's all that
is presently available :-)

Enjoy!

   
                 CRYPTIX 2.00 - CRYPTOGRAPHIC CLASSES FOR JAVA
                                       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Description

   This library contains a suite of cryptographic classes for Java. It is
   important to note that this release is not yet stable, so is only
   recommended for use by serious developers, since there may be major
   design and API changes. For users that require stability, please use
   the previous release .
   
Features missing

   DES and Blowfish are not yet ported to Java.
   
   There is currently very little in the way of documentation and example
   programs.
   
   The auto loading of native libraries (if they are present) has not
   been tested.
   
Features

   The library is now 100% Java, although native libraries will be loaded
   if they are present, in order to improve performance.
   
   PGP support is now being added to the library (currently most PGP
   packet types are supported, except for compressed data packets -
   anyone developing a zip compression library in Java?).
   
Mailing list

   A mailing list exists for the developers and users of this library.
   This list is very low volume, and can be joined by sending
   
          subscribe cryptix-java _your mail address_
          
   to majordomo@systemics.com.
   
   Another mailing list exists for PGP developers, and can be joined by
   sending
   
          subscribe pgp-dev _your mail address_
          
   to majordomo@systemics.com.
