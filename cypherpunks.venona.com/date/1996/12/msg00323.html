Does this "Arsen" still work for Jack D. Hidary
and that EarthWeb LLC?

On Wed, 4 Dec 1996, Dr.Dimitri Vulis KOTM wrote:

&gt; &gt; Just ignore them - Vulis is on the rag again.  Someone please buy Vulis a
&gt; &gt; box of anal tampons so he can calm down.
&gt; 
&gt; This reminds me how someone posted an anonymous message to this list calling
&gt; Matt Blaze a "homosexual Jew" and Tim Scanlon (another lying Tim) immediately
&gt; announced that I must be its author. He lied, of course, being a "cypher punk".
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, seeing that Arsen posted the above obscenities during duty hours, I
&gt; figured I'll post another tutorial on tracking down information on the 'net.
&gt; 
&gt; Arsen vainly insisted on listing his name in InterNIC's database as RA1215
&gt; (unusual for someone supposedly interested in privacy). Arsen listed a phone
&gt; number (+1 718 786 4227) which is apparently at his parents' residence (48-21
&gt; 40th St, Apt 2B, Calvary, NY 11104-4111) and a fax number (+1 212 725 6559).
&gt; 
&gt; The fax number is in Manhattan area code. A good conjecture is that it belongs
&gt; to some sort of business, and that the business's main number ends with a 0.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, calling +1 212 725 6550 (Arsen's listed fax number, 9 replaced by a 0)
&gt; and talking to a nice young lady reveals that this phone number belongs to the
&gt; Web designer EarthWeb, LLC; that they're at 3 Park Ave, 38th floor, New York,
&gt; NY 10016; that the partnership's principals are:
&gt; * Jack D. Hidary, president and CEO, &lt;jack@earthweb.com&gt;
&gt; * Murray Hidary, senior vice president for operations, &lt;murray@earthweb.com&gt;
&gt; * Nova Spivack, senior vice president for marketing, &lt;nova@earthweb.com&gt;
&gt; and that Arsen is their associate network administrator.
&gt; 
&gt; That's how much one can learn just from the fax number in one's InterNIC entry.
&gt; 
&gt; For the logorrhetics' reading pleasure, I'll quote some of Arsen's earlier
&gt; writings on the "cypher punks" mailing list:
&gt; 
&gt; ]Actually, unlike you, I do feel sorry for you, for you truly have no life
&gt; ]and have nothing better to do than to start flame wars and such.  Do
&gt; ]yourself a favor, get a real life.  Go get off your fat ass and do
&gt; ]something with yourself other than masturbating.
&gt; ...
&gt; ]You wouldn't know what a life is if one came up to you and bit you on your
&gt; ]ass. Oh tell us oh great one, and what is it that you know?  But spare us
&gt; ]the flames and hate.  We already know that you are an asshole, of that
&gt; ]there is little doubt.  What is at doubt is your degree, or is it a
&gt; ]pedigree?  Shower us with your knowledge if you have any, for it is
&gt; ]apparent that dazzling us with your bullshit isn't working.
&gt; ...
&gt; ]And what by your definition is your level of life if all your output
&gt; ]seems to be nothing more than flames and flame bait?  How much of a loser
&gt; ]are you to resort to anonymous daily warnings about Tim?  Just how off
&gt; ]topic and stupid was your message when you posted it?  Just how many
&gt; ]plates of pork and beans do you eat each day to keep up your innane level
&gt; ]of flatulence?
&gt; ...
&gt; ]Apparently that "Doctorhood" of yours is good only for masturbatory self
&gt; ]congratulations, and when nobody pays attention to it, you turn around and
&gt; ]put others down so that in your oppinion, such as it is, you come out
&gt; ]smelling like roses.  Buddy, I've news for you, you aren't fooling anyone.
&gt; ]You are the total absolute embodyment of shit.  No, before you
&gt; ]congratulate yourself on your achievement of shithood, you aren't even
&gt; ]even human or dog shit, no.  You are the essence of amoeba shit.  The
&gt; ]lowest of the low. You've a long way to go before you will ever achive
&gt; ]the status of high human shit.  But I must admit, you certainly know how
&gt; ]to strive for that goal.  It's too bad you'll never be more than low
&gt; ]grade microscopic shit though.
&gt; ]...
&gt; ]And for that, you have my deepest condolances.  At least I hope this
&gt; ]comforts you in your lack of life, for assuredly you haven't much of one.
&gt; ]At least at a minimum, if you get nothing else from this message, you'll
&gt; ]get a tenth of an ounce of pitty.
&gt; ]...
&gt; ]And maybe someday, if you are really really good you might even achive
&gt; ]rat shitdom.  Then we'll be real proud of you for being rat shit, but
&gt; ]until that time, strive hard and work long hours.  Hey, and when you reach
&gt; ]rat shitdom and become emeritus ratus shitus, we'll throw you a party!
&gt; 
&gt; Aren't the "cypher punks" a polite lot?
