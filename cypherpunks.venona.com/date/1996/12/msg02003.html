&gt;: This NG is not a certified twelve-step program operating under

&gt;: expectation of privacy. There is also no necessitation for legal
&gt;: confidance.
&gt;
&gt;This has been discussed before.  Most people are aware of how Usenet
&gt;works, and people who don't want their posts linked to their real
&gt;life identities can post anonymously.
&gt;
&gt;: It's also unmoderated. Anyone can look in at any time that they want and
&gt;: review any posts current and past that they see fit thanks to the good
&gt;: people at Dejanews. And anyone can post whatever they want.
&gt;
&gt;Yup.
&gt;
&gt;: However there are a number of individuals engaged in exploitative
&gt;: behaviors with the survivors here and other places on the net. Any
&gt;: therapist or other certified mental health professional can give you a
&gt;: better and more complete definition of "exploitative behaviors" than I
&gt;: could do here.
&gt;
&gt;Changing our tune a bit, aren't we Brent?  The infamous list was
&gt;advertised as a list of predatory offenders and abusers.  Now it
&gt;seems to be just a list of people whose Usenet interactions with
&gt;others you choose to characterize as "exploitative."
&gt;
&gt;: It is mainly for the reason of professional ethics and responsibility
&gt;: that I posted the list of people to be careful of earlier this month.
&gt;: Incumbent in that responsibility is my desire to offer potential victims
&gt;: a survival tool.
&gt;
&gt;Quite frankly, Brent, you offering the survivors in this newsgroup a
&gt;"survival tool" is much like a person on fire offering a gathering of
&gt;penguins an ice cube.  The patrons of this newsgroup are Past Masters
&gt;of survival.  You, on the other hand, are a master only of sticking
&gt;your foot into one bodily opening, while simultaneously sticking your
&gt;head up another.
&gt;
&gt;: By posting that list, I made it totally available to not
&gt;: only the frequent and infrequent subscribers to aar, to explore on their
&gt;: own as they see fit, but to the law enforcement agencies who now monitor
&gt;: usenet as well.
&gt;
&gt;Who, I am sure, are laughing hysterically at all of this.  Please
&gt;continue to pee on your chances of ever doing this professionally
&gt;at every opportunity.
&gt;
&gt;: No strict personal agenda; only a professional one. No personal attacks.
&gt;: Just observations of behavior.
&gt;
&gt;Goodness Brent, do you really think we need you to observe peoples
&gt;behavior for us?  Most of us who have been around the Net since the
&gt;clever little protocols were designed by the engineers, and who can
&gt;even remember events like "The Great Renaming", and the origins of
&gt;Kibo, are fairly astute judges of human behavior.  We have seen
&gt;all sides of every imaginable issue argued from every conceivable
&gt;perspective, and we know the names of all the major players and
&gt;where they stand on each one.

&gt;Anyone want to join me in nominating Mr. Turvey for the coveted "KOTM"
&gt;degree?  I think...
&gt;
&gt;      Brent E. Turvey, MSc Forensic Science, KOTM Usenet
&gt;
&gt;has a very nice ring to it.  He's definitely goofier than Drs. Grubor
&gt;and Vulis.  I also suggest you visit his unintentionally funny writings
&gt;on autoerotic asphyxiation on the Web.  Brent is a man of many talents. :)

Is Brent as goofy as the ASALA terrorist (about to be fired by Earthweb
for net-abuse), or even goofier?
