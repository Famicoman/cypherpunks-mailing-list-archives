Which part was the "excellent idea," falling for the spam of a commercial
company or copying a long message and only adding the stupid "excellent
idea" comment?

Personally, when I got the Houghton-Mifflin spam message, I sent them 5
very large files in reply. Glad to hear others have helped also to crash
their damned mail servers.

Anybody who thinks they were "trying to save the children" needs to take a
wake up pill, read some Mencken or Clemens, and get real. It was a standard
marketing ploy.

The books were no doubt bought from cronies, sent to illiterates in crack
houses, and everyone is happy.

Those who spam our mailing list with commerical advertisements deserve
death. And if that can't (yet) be delivered conveniently, mail bombs.

Fuck Houghton-Mifflin and all those who fell for the spam.

(Interestingly, it appears that a movement is already building to
continually bombard them with mail, each and every Xmas. Next year the
"Craig Shergold Effect" will ensure that their site gets taken down again.)

[This Bible excerpt awaiting review under the U.S. Communications Decency
Act of 1996]
And then Lot said, "I have some mighty fine young virgin daughters. Why
don't you boys just come on in and fuck them right here in my house - I'll
just watch!"....Later, up in the mountains, the younger daughter said:
"Dad's getting old. I say we should fuck him before he's too old to fuck."
So the two daughters got him drunk and screwed him all that night. Sure
enough, Dad got them pregnant, and had an incestuous bastard son....Onan
really hated the idea of doing his brother's wife and getting her pregnant
while his brother got all the credit, so he pulled out before he
came....Remember, it's not a good idea to have sex with your sister, your
brother, your parents, your pet dog, or the farm animals, unless of course
God tells you to. [excerpts from the Old Testament, Modern Vernacular
Translation, TCM, 1996]
