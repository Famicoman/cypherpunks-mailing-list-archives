       This is to inform you about the new adult game that VCS Magazine rated
"The best game of '96" and gave an "Outstanding ****" (4 stars).  "The Search
for Paradise is no doubt one of the greatest XXX Adult games available."  The
first game where it is as much fun as it is a turn on.  Travel the world to
every continent, every country you can think of, and meet some of the most
beautiful women in existence. These women will treat you like a king and obey
your every command.  Any sexual wish you can think of, these women know it
all.  There is a different paradise for every guy out there, and this game
will have them all.  This game uses real models, digital video, and digital
sound
to make it as realistic as possible. You will feel like you're in the same
room as the girl you're talking to.  ---  Required: 386 or better, 4 meg ram

    The last adult game we are going to inform you about is the newly
released "Club Celebrity X".  Imagine being in a club with some very
beautiful, well known, ACTUAL celebrities that with skill, will be making you
breakfast in bed the next day.  These girls you have seen on television, 
magazines, and billboard ads, and now they are on your computer, begging 
for action. Each girl you will recognize and you won't believe your eyes when
you got them in your own bedroom. This game is hot, and once you start 
playing, you won't be able to stop.   ---  Required: 386 or better, 4 meg ram
