CREDIT REBUILDING OF AMERICA
 * REBUILD YOUR OWN CREDIT*

PLEASE FORGIVE THIS E-MAIL INTRUSION BUT IF YOU CAN USE THIS SERVICE?   PLEASE KEEP
READING!!
                                                                                 
   Have you ever been turned down after you applied for a credit card,
department store card, or a gas credit card, or that  new car  you have 
wanted?
   The reason was probably because of something the creditor found on 
your credit report. 
   Thousands of people are denied credit every day because of something that 
appears on their credit report that  is not correct , OR they would like 
removed  from their credit report  for  good!!
    There are many companies out there that can remove tems on your credit 
report but want to charge you any where from $300.00  to  $1,000.00 .   
   BE CAREFUL, most of these companies can’t do anything 
to repair your credit that you can’t do yourself  with my  
“CREDIT REPAIR PACKET”.
  Once I found out just how the " BIG " companies were doing this, 
I put all the information down on a  simple   twelve step process. 
     ** DO IT YOURSELF **  why pay their high prices to repair your 
credit, when you can do it yourself for only $19.95  plus 2.95  for S&amp;H.
      I spent over two years to perfect this process, and if followed to the 
letter, it  will  work!!!
      HAVE the new car you want, the credit cards  you want.  
You don’t have to wait SEVEN to TEN_YEARS for these items to be 
 taken off your credit reprot.
DO IT YOUR SELF!! and feel  GOOD AGAIN!!
Just send your check or money orker to:

 Robert C. Roy, Jr.
