&gt; From:   Dale Thorn
&gt; If you could analogize the list to a human society, then you might
&gt; understand that a pattern of decadence can set in here as it does in
&gt; the more visible society, as is run from Washington DC, etc.  It is
&gt; my hope to make a contribution here (as in the more visible society)
&gt; to fight off some of that decadence, even when I get beat up on for it.

&gt; There is a huge the difference between a society of people relating to
&gt; each other based on principles of coercion vs an extemporaneous society
&gt; of individuals who make their own decisions (daily) about when/where/how
&gt; long they will associate with another.
&gt; The society run by Washington,D.C. expects that people will have no
&gt; choice but to fly in formation in the direction set by the leader who
&gt; represents the majority (sort of).

That's a judgement, rather than an obvious truth.  Fact is, service in
Washington is purely voluntary, and one can leave anytime they wish.

&gt; The virtual "society" of the cpunks is only based on their interest in
&gt; opening up their mail and reading a few messages here &amp; there according
&gt; to their mood of the day or the moment.

Sounds pretty casual, doesn't it?  Maybe there are a *few* c-punks who
fit that description, but there are at least as many who are in this
thing for some heavy action, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.

&gt; It is true that formal societies, like the one which was initially
&gt; intended by The Founders (of the US), often run afoul of the original
&gt; purpose for which it was begun.   They decay for many reasons.   This is
&gt; precisely one of the elements in the background of the cpunks thinking
&gt; ("the founders" and others) about societies and the "ties that bind"
&gt; (supposedly) us to each other:  the interest in being released from that
&gt; supposition that we are bound to each other and are obligated to
&gt; maintain a relationship of some kind (as determined by the PC moral
&gt; 'authorities').

[snip]

When I "joined" the Audio Engineering Society in the late 1970's, to get
their journal cheap, it was going pretty good.  Eventually it decayed
quite a bit, where they were running more pictures of their get-togethers
and awards programs than anything else.  I see cypherpunks in the same
straits potentially, as long as so many of the long-term "members" can
continue claiming that "It belongs to one person, really, our Cypherpunks
God", etc.  Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of potential here, and I
hope it continues, but....  BTW, thanks for a very civil reply.
