&gt; Igor,
&gt; 
&gt; I greatly appreciate the fact that you are looking at the algorithm.
&gt; You have the general idea but I do not believe that you have spent
&gt; enough time with it to understand what all is going on.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, be advised that all Bs and Cs are not random numbers 
&gt; at all, but rather they are randomly selected from a previously selected
&gt; set of values, so that there are no repeats and all Bs are less than the
&gt; smallest possible C, and the sum of B plus C is always &lt; 32761.
&gt; Furthermore, either B or C, one and sometimes both, are prime numbers.

See my another reply, your requirements to A, B, and C above are not
good to produce "good numbers".

If C is 2*B and B is prime as you require, the only output from the
triplet you will see is two numbers.

igor

&gt; You might have an A(i) value of zero, and will have it 1 in C(i)
&gt; iterations, but you can never have a b value of 0, or a C values or zero.
&gt; Nor can any set of:
&gt; 
&gt;           A(JV)=A(JV)+B(JV) MOD C(JV)
&gt; 
&gt; generate a partial set set of the possible C values because either the B
&gt; value or the C value is prime. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, initial A values are chosen so that A+ Bmax + Cmax is less
&gt; than 32761.
&gt; 
&gt; Accordingly the circumstances that you describe cannot occur. The
&gt; randomness referred to in the As, Bs, and Cs, result from the selection
&gt; process, not from the values themselves. It goes without saying that
&gt; using random values would not work, for the reason that you mention
&gt; plus other. 
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, there are no repeats between any of the As, Bs, and Cs which
&gt; is one indication that they are not random. To the contrary, the pool of
&gt; numbers are selected numbers, approximately 66% prime and 33% nonprime,
&gt; which maximizes the covariance, in a LP sense, with the modulos 4096 and
&gt; 256.
&gt; 
&gt; The selection process uses a key, generated by the user from the timing of
&gt; keystrokes, to select the which As, Bs and Cs will actually be used. I
&gt; tried to explain this in the detailed algorithm explanation. at the web
&gt; site.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was sort of tired of endless talk that "IPG algorithm was not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; peer-reviewed, blah blah blah, so we won't even look at it, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; blah blah blah", and decided to look at what Don Wood writes and
&gt; &gt; &gt; try to see how his program actually works. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I am not an expert in cryptography, and will appreciate all
&gt; &gt; &gt; corrections. The web page to look at is <A  HREF="http://www.netprivacy.com/algo.html">http://www.netprivacy.com/algo.html</A>,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it describes IPG algorithm in some detail.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, the description of the algorithm is extremely unclear. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand that this may be Don Wood's writing style, but it is certainly 
&gt; &gt; &gt; not the most efficient style for precise communications. I suggest that
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don tries to rewrite his description to be more structured.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Second, I seriously suspect that his algorithm of "trimming" is NOT
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to work right. Just to remind everyone, he generates pseudo-random
&gt; &gt; &gt; A(JV), B(JV), C(JV) such that
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	16384 &lt;  C &lt; 20361
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	         B &lt; 12227
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	A arbitrary (at least the web page contains no restrictions 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	  on the value of A).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then goes on to "trimming" -- a process that obtains a new value
&gt; &gt; &gt; of A that is LESS than 16384 through this algorithm: 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;        DO
&gt; &gt; &gt;          JV=JV+1
&gt; &gt; &gt;          IF JV=53 THEN JV=0
&gt; &gt; &gt;          A(JV)=(A(JV)+B(JV)) MOD C(JV)
&gt; &gt; &gt;        UNTIL A(JV)&lt;16384
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; We shall first note that THERE ARE CASES WHEN THIS ALGORITHM WILL NEVER
&gt; &gt; &gt; STOP! For example, if all A values are _initially_ 16385 and all C
&gt; &gt; &gt; values are 16386 and all B's are 0, it is obvious that the pseudocode 
&gt; &gt; &gt; above will be stuck in endless loop.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; No good for IPG algorithm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; in fact, if only some triplets of A, B, and C have B == 0 and 16384 &lt; A &lt; C,
&gt; &gt; &gt; these triplets will always be ignored (skipped) by his trimming process.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Note also that if B(K) == 1, his algorithm will need to make C passes
&gt; &gt; through the loop for JV == k, in order to generate a new value of A(JV).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is very inefficient and results in a bias for triplets with high
&gt; &gt; Bs -- because they will generate good A(JV) more frequently.
