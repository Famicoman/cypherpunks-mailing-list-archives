&gt;     you're not unusual, in the first place since many high performers
&gt;     just were not willing to waste time in a slow paced and probably
&gt;     parochial (not religion connotation) school.
&gt;     as for a the attitude, Dale has carried right on without taking
&gt;     a break.  as for being less wired and neurotic, I doubt it --Dale's
&gt;     into big time, including picking on anyone who he deems inferior
&gt;     and or maybe even "Children of a Lesser god."

Are you saying I've picked on everyone?  I didn't claim to be neurosis-
free, but at least I recognize neurosis and deal with it reasonably well.
If you think any specific point I've made connotes neurosis rather than
an attempt to help someone out or correct a serious fallacy, then feel
free to point it out, and please be specific.  It's not fair to blame
someone who is an active and somewhat feisty thinker for your own
inferiority complex.

&gt;     did logic preclude decorum. that's sort of follows the rule:
&gt;         "profanity is the refuge of inarticulate motherfuckers."
&gt;     when you blow you own logic by being profanely indecorus. And I'll
&gt;     say it again, and again:

Profanity?  I doubt I've been as profane as most of the long-term
subscribers (leaders?) on the list.  Maybe you should check those
posts more carefully.

&gt;         if the residents of cypherpunk land can not express themselves
&gt;     with respect for their colleages, even in disagreement, then cp is
&gt;     a has been and will be quoted in ridicule by the news organizations
&gt;     and the Congress as an anarchistic bunch of uncivilized and uncouth
&gt;     barbarians screaming "cryptography and anarchy for the masses."

I/we should seek respect from "news organizations" and/or "the Congress"??

You must have ate something really bad before you had that dream.
