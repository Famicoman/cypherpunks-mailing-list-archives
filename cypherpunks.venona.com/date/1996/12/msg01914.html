                 The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                              Presents
                           Rodney Thayer
                   Sable Technology Corporation

                  "Applying PGP To Digital Commerce"



                        Tuesday, January 7, 1997
                               12 - 2 PM
                   The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                     One Federal Street, Boston, MA


Rodney Thayer has 20 years experience in the software development business.
For the past 10 years he has been designing, implementing, deploying, and
troubleshooting networking software.  He currently is the Principal of a
consulting firm based in Newton, Massachusetts where he is involved in the
implementation of communications products for a variety of customers,
including software vendors, major end-user organizations, and several
governmental organizations both foreign and domestic.  He also writes and
lectures on the deployment, troubleshooting, and implementation of data
communications networks.


Mr. Thayer  will talk about how PGP can be used in the business world
today, for exchange of information, digitally identifying documents, and
other commerce applications.  In this presentation, we will discuss the
application of PGP, including mechanics, the cryptographic and legal
issues, and the infrastructure requirements for it's use.

The state of the art in digital message encryption is now at the point
where it has become practical to use encrypted and digitally signed
email for digital commerce.  Recently, one scheme, PGP, has emerged
from the realm of the cyberpunk as a legitimate tool for business.
Commercial products are now available that support PGP encryption in
electronic mail and for documents and digital storage.

PGP is no longer a cult tool for computer junkies and cyberpunks.  It
is a legitimate, sound cryptographic technology that can be used,
today, for digital commerce.  As an increasingly crypto-aware business
community searches for solutions, the question of how to use message
encryption tools such as PGP becomes germaine to the business community.



This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, January 7, 1997 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$27.50. This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch.
;-).  The Harvard Club *does* have dress code: jackets and ties for men,
and "appropriate business attire" for women.

We will attempt to record this meeting and put it on the web in RealAudio
format at some future date

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we *really*
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, January 4, or you won't be on the list for lunch.  Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.

Planned speakers for DCSB are:

 February   David Kaufman    1996 in Review / Predictions for 1997
 March      TBA
 April      Stewart Baker    Encryption Policy and Digital Commerce

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on
the first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a
presentation to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program
Commmittee, care of Robert Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .

For more information about the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, send
"info dcsb" in the body of a message to majordomo@ai.mit.edu .  If you
want to subscribe to the DCSB e-mail list, send "subscribe dcsb" in the

Looking forward to seeing you there!
