&gt; I don't mean to sound rude or insult you personally, but this is utterly
&gt; absurd.  If everyone is paying for the software then the company would be
&gt; making even MORE money.  Only a fool would want to make less money!!  If
&gt;money
&gt; wasn't important to these people they wouldn't be in the business of selling
&gt; software in the first place!

&gt; Aside from putting a gun to people's heads, the only thing that lowers
&gt;prices
&gt; is competition.

Yes, I was assuming a free market.  Sorry if that was not clear.

Not only would software companies face competition in the decrypting-processor
market, but they also face competition with other packages running on
other platforms.

Presumably customers would need some sort of reason to use the
decrypting-processor.  Some companies may choose lower price.

&gt; Only a fool would want to make less money!!

I agree completely!

&gt;&gt;  It is not out of the question for software vendors to sell
&gt;&gt;  two versions of the same software.  One is the piracy-free
&gt;&gt;  version and the other is the copy-as-much-as-you-can version.
&gt;&gt;  I would expect the piracy-free version to be substantially
&gt;&gt;  cheaper.

&gt; That would render the entire scheme pointless.  It only takes _____ONE_____
&gt; copy of the software to get out for the whole world to pirate it.

This was discussed a few posts back.

Let's say you manage to get the secret key out of the decrypting-processor.
That gives you the executable which could run on any decrypting-processor.
Since it is not authenticated (*) you can't run it on another
decrypting-processor.  You can run it in emulation someplace else,
but a heavy performance price is paid.  If the leading edge processors
are all decrypting-processors, a very heavy performance price is paid.
If the instruction set is kept secret, even writing an emulator could
become hard.

(* I am being inconsistent, incidentally.  At one point I said that software
would be authenticated once, but I now realize that to prevent multiple
uses it has to be authenticated for use on a particular processor, too.)
