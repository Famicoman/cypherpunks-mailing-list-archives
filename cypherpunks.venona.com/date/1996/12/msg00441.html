I heard an almost identical story from a security guard at DEFCON IV last
july in Las Vegas.  He said it happened in the hotel where he was working
(not the Monte Carlo, which had just opened) in 1995.  The management
managed to cover the event up and it never, according to him, appeared in
the local papers.


&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt;  A friend of mine from UT passed this story onto me from the "Daily
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt;  Texan" - the University of Texas newspaper. Apparently it occured
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt;  during Fall Premier -- a UT tradition that is a celebration of the
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt;  end of midterms.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"Reason to not party anymore"-
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This guy went out last Saturday night to a party.  He was having a
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;good time, had a couple  of beers and some girl seemed to like him
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and invited him to go to another party.  He quickly agreed and
&gt;| &gt;decided
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to go along with her.  She took him to a party in some apartment
&gt;| &gt;and
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;they continued to drink, and even got involved with some other
&gt;| &gt;drugs
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;(unknown which).
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The next thing he knew, he woke up completely naked in a bathtub
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;filled with ice.  He was still feeling the effects of the drugs,
&gt;| &gt;but
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;looked around to see he was alone.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;He looked down at his chest, which had "CALL 911 OR YOU WILL DIE"
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;written on it in lipstick.  He saw a phone was on a stand next to
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the tub, so he picked it up and dialed.  He explained to the EMS
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;operator what the situation was and that he didn't know where he
&gt;| &gt;was,
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;what he took, or why he was really calling.  She advised him to get
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;out of the tub.  He did, and she asked him to look himself over in
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the mirror.  He did, and appeared normal, so she told him to check
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;his back.  He did, only to find two 9 inch slits on his lower back.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;She told him to get back in the tub immediately, and they sent a
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;rescue team over.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Apparently, after being examined, he found out more of what had
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;happened.  His kidneys were stolen.  They are worth 10,000 dollars
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;each on the black market.  (I was unaware this even existed.)
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Several guesses are in order:
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The second party was a sham, the people involved had to be at least
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;medical students, and it was not just recreational drugs  he was
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;given.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Regardless, he is currently in the  hospital on life  support,
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;awaiting a spare kidney. The University of Texas in conjunction
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with Baylor University Medical Center is conducting tissue research
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to match the sophomore student with a donor.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Any information leading to the arrest of the individuals may be
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;forwarded to the University of Texas Campus police, or the Texas
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Rangers.
&gt;| &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
