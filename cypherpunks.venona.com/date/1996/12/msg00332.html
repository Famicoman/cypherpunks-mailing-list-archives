Even with a custom client, I suppose there's always a chance 
of pulling things out of RAM.

How about a slightly different question:

Is there a way to sign it such that it wouldn't work if the
signature was removed, so there would be no question 
of who created it?

I suppose this is analogous to: Is there a way to sign
plaintext such that the plaintext can't be seen without the
signature attached?  I suppose not..

Is there a way to embed the signature as part of the 
code so it can't be removed?

&gt; A graphic-designer friend of mine and I were talking
&gt; about VRML avatars, and custom design work, and

&gt; 
&gt; His worry is that since everyone in the same virtual
&gt; environment as his customer would see the designer 
&gt; avatar, wouldn't they also be able to easily rip off
&gt; his work?  (or his customer's property, take your pick.)
&gt; 
&gt; I wasn't sure...it seems to me that I read something vaguely
&gt; along these lines for a cryptography protocol of some sort..
&gt; The problem is this:  Is there a way for a user to "view" the client's
&gt; avatar (and in this sense, the user usually has to receive a copy 
&gt; of the code to render the avatar and render it on the local machine)
&gt; but not save a copy?  Assume that a client with no save feature
&gt; is not a viable option...too easy to work around.

Well, its concievable to write your own client, and make the code such
that it only works with that client...  I know, it kindof sucks, doesn't
it?

&gt; 
&gt; I suppose an analogy would be: Is there a way for a person to
&gt; see the plaintext, but not record it?  I think that question really
&gt; answers itself - no.  How about alternatives?  If the server
&gt; of the environment only renders "views" (say, certain angles, or
&gt; a bitmap) of the avatar, rather than sending the description file?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other thoughts?
