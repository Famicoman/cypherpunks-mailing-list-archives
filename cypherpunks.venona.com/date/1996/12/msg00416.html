&gt;If an entrepreneur wants to sell a new electrical gizmo and wants an
&gt;independent review of its safety, he pays $$$ for it. Apparently one of the
&gt;functions of the new brand of "cypher punks" is to provide a similar service
&gt;for free. Sorry, I'm not a part of it, and I'm not *that* interested in Don's
&gt;proposal. I have better use for my time.

However, I assume that you have no objection to others reviewing Don't
proposal for free (Actually for reputation).
&gt;
&gt;I also don't think that the ease of breaking the code should be the only
&gt;consideration in evaluating a low-end cryptographic product. ...
&gt;
&gt;... If someone wants to market (and support) a crypto package for
&gt;the masses and gets the masses to deploy it, I take my hat off to them. It
&gt;doesn't matter if the code itself can be cracked as easily as the codes used
&gt;in PKZIP or MS Excel or MS Word (reportedly). If the users discover that the
&gt;code isn't strong enough for their needs, they'll upgrade to stronger codes.
&gt;The path from weak crypto to strong crypto is much shorter than the path from
&gt;no crypto to some crypto.
&gt;
&gt;If the user interface and [did you mean "is" - bf] logical and transparent 
&gt;and provides hooks to
&gt;replace the weak (non-export-controlled) crypto being shipped with a stronger
&gt;one (say, by FTPing a DLL) then it's a Good Thing.

Good interfaces are definitely something needed for the widespread adoption
of crypto, either strong or weak.  However, the general opinion I have
heard is that UIs with easily replaced crypto are covered by ITAR.


&gt;Don is doing a Good Thing and the "cypher punks" are doing an evil thing.

If Don is contributing to better interfaces, then I agree he is doing a
good thing.  If all he is doing is proposing a new algorithm and describing
it with, to be charitable, non-standard uses of well defined terms, then I
disagree.

I strongly disagree that cypherpunks are doing an evil thing by exposing
the weaknesses in anyone's (including Don's) crypto system.  There are many
ways to contribute, and publicizing the facts about a system are one of
them.
