&gt;This isn't to start any arguments, it's just an FYI...I noticed that when I
&gt;worked for a bank, many banks would only allow other banks to call to verify
&gt;funds.  What this meant was, I'd have customers calling me who in turn had
&gt;customers who were growing *very* impatient because they had written a
&gt;personal check, who had to wait for the clerk to call to verify funds, spend
&gt;10 minutes on hold for bookkeeping only to find that the bank they were
&gt;calling only allows other banks to verify funds, who then had to wait for the
&gt;clerk to call the company's bank to call the other bank to sit on hold
&gt;another 10 minutes for bookkeeping only to have the bookkeeper try to weasel
&gt;his/her way out of doing any work by disputing the fact that you worked for a
&gt;bank, blah, blah, blah.
&gt;
&gt;What's the point?  Maybe some of us don't want to have to go into debt just
&gt;to buy groceries, and don't want to carry buttloads of cash on us all of the
&gt;time.  With banks charging ridiculous fees to keep *your* money in a checking
&gt;account, where's the big incentive?
&gt;
&gt;I say we go back to a barter system

&gt;
&gt;People on the list could probably come up with much better ways to
&gt;authenticate a reputation. Until then, for personal checks, you can
&gt;call any bank in the U.S., ask for bookkeeping, and ask them if there
&gt;are funds in the bank to cover the check you're holding. Any bank
&gt;should give you a yes or no on this. Some banks, like the First Banks
&gt;here in Minnesota, will do this through their automated telephone
&gt;banking services, 24 hours.
