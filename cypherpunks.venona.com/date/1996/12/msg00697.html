By the way, on this oftentimes off-topic issue of "bigotry" and "racism,"
here's a zinger some of you may not have thought much about. And it's
certainly related to the themes of Chaumian "credentials without identity,"
which is very much on-topic.

While it has been claimed by some that "crypto anarchy" means that race
won't matter, that cyberspace interactions will be color-blind, this is
misleading.

While many--probably most--users will care only for cyberspace personna
issues, and not meatspace personna issues of race, color, height, weight,
etc., this is not something built in to anonymous transactions.

Consider a "race credential" offered by some entity. Perhaps one goes down
to the local Aryan Nations office and gets one's genetic heritage stamped,
or down to the Kwanzaa Youth Center to be similarly stamped....

(Why some groups might want this is left as an exercise for the reader.
Perhaps a less-inflammatory example (to some of the sensitive amongst you)
might be that some women want to interact in "women only" forums--a clear
case of discrimination, no?--and may want a "gender bit" avaiable to
display as a credential.)

But, you may ask (if you are new here or haven't been following the work of
Chaum and others), won't display of such a race or gender bit compromise
one's identity or be easily forged? The simple answer is "No."

Hal Finney has written several good articles for this list about
"credentials without identity." And of course David Chaum wrote the
originals.

The canonical example is that of an "age field" in an unforgeable ID card,
granting one access to, say, a bar, without revealing identity. (This
become especially important in an age of smartcards and wide use of
cardreaders at entr points to various places...without a "credentials
without identity" system, every passage through such a portal provides too
much information to those compiling surveillance records, dossiers,
customer preference lists, etc.)

But a "race field" would allow those who wish to only communicate with
certain races to do so.

Just to set the record straight, and one reason ethnic separatist groups
are likely to become intensely interested in crypto anarchy.
