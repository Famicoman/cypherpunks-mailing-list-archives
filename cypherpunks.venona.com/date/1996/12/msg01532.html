See what jerk tcmay(fart) is: he sends crypto discussions to the "cypher
punks" mailing list, where crypto is off-topic now.

"Timothy C. May" &lt;tcmay@got.net&gt; writes:
&gt; I've noticed a few references in the press, and maybe on this list, to the
&gt; idea that because some bad things may be done with untraceable payments
&gt; (true Chaumian digicash, not the watered down version offering only
&gt; one-sided untraceability), that governments will "not allow" such
&gt; untraceable payments.

Fuck the gubmint. Fuck the patent law. Patent law, copyright law, libel
law - none of that shit has any relevance in the cyberspace. Do I understand
right that David Chaum no longer runs ecash? Then I see no ethical reason
not to implement his original ideas with full anonymity *NOW*.

...
&gt; "Untraceable payments" refer to payer- and payee-untraceable Chaum-style
&gt; cash. Although for the discussions here of extortion, payee-untraceable
&gt; (the person being paid would not be traceable is my sense of this term)
&gt; digital cash would be sufficient; that the payment originated from XYZ
&gt; Corporation or some account at the Bank of Albania would not stop the acts.
&gt;
&gt; Chaum has in recent years attempted (I have to presume) to take the "edge"
&gt; of fully-intraceable digital cash by making it only partly untraceable.
&gt; Many of us hypothesized that "mixes" (as in remailers) could be used to
&gt; fully-untraceabalize (?) even partly-traceable systems. I recall Lucky
&gt; Green, Hal Finney, and others in such discussions. "Banks" were proposed to
&gt; do this. Recently, Ian Goldberg claims to have a system which formally
&gt; accomplishes this.

So instead of shooting your stupid mouth, issue some ecash and promise to
exchange it for real US$ upon bearer's demand. Do you have the balls for it?

&gt; Suppose there exists a supplier of fully-untraceable (or payee-untraceable
&gt; at least) cash *somewhere* in the world. It could be a physical bank, a la
&gt; the Bank of Albania, or it could be an underground payment system, a la the
&gt; Mafia, the Tongs, the Triads, whatever. A reputation-reliant system which
&gt; says "Present us with the proper set of numbers and we will provide money
&gt; to the bearer, or follow instructions, and so on." (I'm informally
&gt; describing the process of "redeeming" a digital bearer instrument,
&gt; converting the set of numbers into some other form of specie, or item of
&gt; value, whatever. Maybe gold, maybe dollars, maybe an entry into an account
&gt; somewhere. The "untraceability," via the blinding operation, means that the
&gt; bearer is not linked to the transaction made earlier, so there is not risk
&gt; at the bank or Triad. I'm also not distinguishing between offline and
&gt; online clearing here...my feeling for a long time has been that online
&gt; clearing has many advantages, but I suspect it does not work too well in
&gt; the extortion case described here, until something like PipeNet can be used
&gt; as part of the process.)

Translation: you don't have the balls to do this yourself.

See, "cypher punks" can only while and flame, and they don't have the
guts to issue ecash and to say: this token will be exchanged for $1 by
Lucky Green; and that token will be exchanged for $10 by Hall Filly.

&gt; This is why I look forward to this Brave New World of fully untraceable
&gt; communications and fully untraceable economic transactions.

But you don't have the balls to bring it any closer, you airbag parasite.
