&gt; Subject: Re: Reasons in support of crypto-anarchy WAS Re: Why am I
&gt;   wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; [Part 1]
&gt; I've been following the concepts of digital cash and encryption, since
&gt; I read the article in the August 1992 issue of Scientific American on
&gt; "encrypted signatures."  While I've only followed the Digitaliberty area
&gt; for a few weeks, I can already see a number of points that do (and
&gt; should!) strongly concern the average savvy individual:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  How can we translate the freedom afforded by the Internet to
&gt; ordinary life?
&gt; 

By realizing that freedom is freedom, the medium is irrelevant.

&gt; 2.  How can we keep the government from banning encryption, digital
&gt; cash, and other systems that will improve our freedom?
&gt; 

By making shure they don't have the authority to make the decision in the
first place.

&gt; A few months ago, I had a truly and quite literally "revolutionary"
&gt; idea, and I jokingly called it "Assassination Politics": I speculated on
&gt; the question of whether an organization could be set up to _legally_
&gt; announce either that it would be awarding a cash prize to somebody who
&gt; correctly "predicted" the death of one of a list of violators of
&gt; rights, usually either government employees, officeholders, or
&gt; appointees.  It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public,
&gt; and individuals would be able send those contributions using digital
&gt; cash.
&gt; 

If the intent is to motivate others to kill or otherwise harm others simply
because you don't agree with them or their actions is reprehensible and
moraly or ethicaly undefensible.

&gt; 
&gt; On the contrary; my speculation assumed that the "victim" is a
&gt; government employee, presumably one who is not merely taking a paycheck
&gt; of stolen tax dollars, but also is guilty of extra violations of rights
&gt; beyond this. (Government agents responsible for the Ruby Ridge incident
&gt; and Waco come to mind.)  In receiving such money and in his various
&gt; acts, he violates the "Non-aggression Principle" (NAP) and thus,
&gt; presumably, any acts against him are not the initiation of force under
&gt; libertarian principles.
&gt; 

Every citizen of this country is a 'government employee' in one sense or
another.

By resorting to violence you are no better than the ones you proport to
protect us against.
