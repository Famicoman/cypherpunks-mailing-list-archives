Two things are wrong with the law.

1) Parents still can turn the TV off.  They don't need any V-chip or 
   bills from congress to do that.   (This obvious fact seems
   to escape every bug-eyed person)

2) The v-chip would have already been deployed as an option
   if congress hadn't stepped into the ring.  The marketplace
   saw the demand and had already developed the technology.
   Congress got it's finger in the pie and it will probably be
   2 years now before its actually deployed.  Gee thanks Newt.

&gt; Tell me whats wrong with this section of the telecom bill.  I have a six
&gt; year old boy I am trying to raise
&gt; and it is hard enough to teach him respect and values without explaining why
&gt; Ned Beatty is being
&gt; bungholed in the woods by Billy Bob or why the Terminator splattered this
&gt; guys brains all over the
&gt; wall.  
&gt;         Tell me why parents should not be able to censor their OWN
&gt; television so that they may raise their children the way THEY see
&gt; fit...................Did your dad give you his old
&gt; playboys?.........NOOOOO............
&gt; Did he take you down to your grandmothers autopsy before her
&gt; funeral?...................I Don't Think So.....
&gt;         Honestly, don't you believe that what a child is exposed to effects
&gt; his judgement, perception,
&gt;  attitude,and character??
&gt; 
&gt; All I'm saying is it's tough to raise a child these days without the added
&gt; distortion of modern 
&gt; programing and parents need not be denied any tool that can help them
&gt; achieve success.
&gt;          
&gt;  SEC. 551. PARENTAL CHOICE IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING.
&gt;             (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
&gt;                 (1) Television influences children's perception of the values
&gt;               and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.
&gt;                 (2) Television station operators, cable television system
&gt;               operators, and video programmers should follow practices in
&gt;               connection with video programming that take into consideration
&gt;               that television broadcast and cable programming has established
&gt;               a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of American children.
&gt;                 (3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of
&gt;               television each week and some children are exposed to as much 
&gt;               as 11 hours of television a day.
&gt;                 (4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video
&gt;               programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent
&gt;               and aggressive behavior later in life than children not so
&gt;               exposed, and that children exposed to violent video programming
&gt;               are prone to assume that acts of violence are acceptable
&gt;               behavior.
&gt;                 (5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to
&gt;               an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on
&gt;               television by the time the child completes elementary school.
&gt;                 (6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the
&gt;               pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on
&gt;               television, eroding the ability of parents to develop
&gt;               responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.
&gt;                 (7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual
&gt;               video programming and strongly support technology that would
&gt;               give them greater control to block video programming in the 
&gt;               home that they consider harmful to their children.
&gt;                 (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering
&gt;               parents to limit the negative influences of video programming
&gt;               that is harmful to children.
&gt;                 (9) Providing parents with timely information about the 
&gt;               nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological
&gt;               tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other
&gt;               programming that they believe harmful to their children is a
&gt;               nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that
&gt;               compelling governmental interest.

&gt; ||The government  is my shepherd I need not work. It alloweth me to lie
&gt;  down on a good job. It leadeth me beside stilled factories. It destroyeth
&gt;  my initiative. It leadeth me in the path of a parasite for politics sake. YEA,
&gt;  though I walk through the valley of laziness and deficet spending I shall
&gt;  fear no evil, for the government is with me. It prepareth an economic utopia
&gt;  for me by appropriating the earnings of my grandchildren. It filleth my head
&gt;  with false security. My inefficiency runeth over. Surely, the government 
&gt; should care for me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in a fools paradise
&gt; forever.................AMEN!   || nuke'm if ya got'em||
