&gt;&gt;    Earlier, I mentioned that two and a half protocols survived the 
&gt;&gt; day. The remaining one is MSP. It's actually not a bad protocol. It 
&gt;&gt; has two features that none of the others have: the ability to label 
&gt;&gt; classified messages, and a cryptographically strong signed receipt.
&gt;&gt; Both of these functions are highly important for government users. It 
&gt;&gt; looks like government suppliers are going to go ahead and implement
&gt;&gt; it, and the government is going to use it.

&gt;Although these benefits are present in the current MSP, I
&gt;don't see anything inherent in MSP that makes it necessarily superior in these 
&gt;areas.  If you were doing normal MIME-type receipts (whatever that means, since
&gt;I think there are three different drafts under way currently), and you simply 
&gt;added the ability to cryptographically sign a timestamp in the "proper" MIME 
&gt;receipt type, then MSP would lose this advantage.

FIF.  I guess this could be said about any of the protocols.  With enough 
changes they all have the same feature set. :-)  MSP just has it now and it 
works.

&gt;I think labeling could potentially be done by follow-on
&gt;versions of other packages as well, since I think we all agree that generic 
&gt;labeling which can be used both for standard gov't-style classification levels 
&gt;and compartments, as well as for business-style sensitivity labeling.  In fact,
&gt;I'd almost be inclined to say that it would likely be as easy (or easier) to 
&gt;create a new general-purpose labeling system for use with any of the 
&gt;competitors than it would be to modify MSP to support business-style labels in 
&gt;addition to the gov't-style labels I'm sure it has today (maybe it already has 
&gt;labels, but I don't think that this is that tough of a problem to solve in any 
&gt;event).

Well, read MSP first before assuming.  And of course, see above comment.

                                                                -Peter
