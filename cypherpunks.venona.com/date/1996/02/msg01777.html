&gt; CompuScam, Inc., an unwholly-owned invention of InventiData, is pleased to
&gt; announce its latest offering in the growingly lucrative Internet Security
&gt; market.  Called "Secure Users Everywhere", SUE is "guaranteed privacy
&gt; protection for citizen-units everywhere," according to Ed Carp, Chief
&gt; Scientist, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Everything Else for
&gt; CompuScam.  In today's press release, Carp said that "SUE is destined to
&gt; become the dominant market leader in a field full of inferior products."
&gt; 
&gt; SUE is designed to work in any environment, and provides "Fort Knox"
&gt; security for Internet users who wish to transact business over the "net".
&gt; "Up until now, the Internet has been totally exposed, totally wide open to
&gt; every 12-year-old wannabe cracker with a cheap PC and a modem," said Carp,
&gt; "but with SUE, all that has changed overnight.  Now SUE users can safely
&gt; and securely exchange the most sensitive of documents, including credit
&gt; card and checking account numbers, SSN, employee information, credit
&gt; reports, gold bars - virtually anything that is of value can now be safely
&gt; transported across the Internet."
&gt; 
&gt; No details were immediately available on the technical foundations of SUE,
&gt; but Carp indicated that this is to provide enhanced security for its
&gt; customers, adding that "you wouldn't want everyone to see your data, would
&gt; you?  Then why would you want everyone to know about how this software
&gt; works?"  According to CompuScam, SUE is composed of a small software "TSR"
&gt; that is loaded into memory when a computer is first powered up, and a
&gt; proprietary hardware device, known as a CUD ("compulsive exteriorization
&gt; device") that provides "total security" for the software.  Carp indicated
&gt; that the software TSR is "completely ITAR/RNG/SHA/RC4/BBS/RSA/MD5
&gt; compliant, and meets all government standards for the very highest levels
&gt; of cryptographic software, including FIPS-180, SESAME, and STU-III."  The
&gt; hardware device is reportedly PRNG/RNG compliant.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, the SUE product is reportedly backwards-compatible with most
&gt; other manufacturer's "inferior" cryptographic products, including products
&gt; from Digital Pathworks, AT&amp;T, VeriSign, IBM, and others.  Asked whether or
&gt; not SUE is compatible with electronic cash offerings from First Virtual
&gt; and others, Carp said, "Our total solution is so comprehensive, we're
&gt; fixed problems that even the National Security Agency hasn't thought of
&gt; yet.  We've also totally addressed the major problems that First Virtual
&gt; brought to light last month in their press release," adding that no other
&gt; cryptographic software maker had even responded to First Virtual's
&gt; announcement, "let alone done anything about it.  We are acting now to
&gt; protect our customers and children on the Internet by providing total
&gt; coverage of the market."
&gt; 
&gt; Carp denied rumors that the CompuScam was nothing but a mailbox located in
&gt; a Mailboxes Etc., branch office in Garland.  "I believe you will find that
&gt; a reporter obtained an early press release which contained an
&gt; typographical error in our suite number," adding that the company is
&gt; expecting to move soon to new offices near Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto,
&gt; adding that "the proximity to so many Silicon Valley companies will no
&gt; doubt enhance the value of our
&gt; stock^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hquality of our software."
&gt; 
&gt; When asked about the timing of the release, noting that it was only a few
&gt; days before the company was scheduled to go public, Carp said, "this is an
&gt; absolutely wonderful opportunity for investors to get in on the ground
&gt; floor of this new technology" adding something about a new Porsche which
&gt; the reporters didn't quite catch.
&gt; 
&gt; SUE is available for PCs running all versions of Microsoft Windows,
&gt; Windows 95, Windows NT and MS-DOS, as well as all UNIX and UNIX-like
&gt; platforms, and MVS.  The CUD hardware device is available in .357, .45,
&gt; .44 Magnum, and 9MM versions.  Pricing was not immediately available.

	And of course, export license has been granted to Iraq, Iran
	and the rest of the "non-hostile challenged" (?) world.
	Wonderful!
