Hey, I resent the implication, here!  Three months ago I wouldn't have known 
what you meant by that, but "comparatively" long ago I learned that "LD" is 
Detweiler, who apparently has a long and established history of using 
aliases.  It sounds like you're trying to imply that I am either a Detweiler 
"tentacle" (yet another term of art that I learned in the last couple of 
months) or am somehow in league with him.  Right?!?

Well, "It ain't so."  Now, I realize how difficult it is for me to prove 
that I'm not some other particular person, but from the snippets I've 
managed to see over the last few months on Internet, this Detweiler 
character appears to know FAR more about the use of Internet than I do. (He 
apparently is a sleazy bastard, but then you probably know much more about 
that than I do...)  Hell, it was only a couple of months ago that I even 
learned how to use PGP with Eudora.  I've only had a full SLIP account for a 
few months before that.

In fact, so far (luckily for me, I guess) my only contact with LD is that I 
was flamed by him, actually under the Detweiler name, when I first posted 
"Assassination Politics" to various USENET areas.  At that point, I had no 
idea of his checkered history (still don't know much; I'd appreciate hearing 
more) and he apparently assumed that I was some Tim May clone.  He even 
referred to May as "TCM," a set of initials that mystified me for a week, 
until some kind soul sent me a small snippet of the Cybernomicon, the part 
dealing with "net-killings."

At that point, he ignored me, probably classifying me as a clueless newbie.  
His flaming ceased when he discovered that I was not only not "in the TCM 
camp," but I hadn't even heard of May and Cypherpunks.

In any case, as I understand it from vague commentary, some of you people 
"out there" know a lot more about LD, and it should be possible for me to 
show my history in enough detail to convince anybody that I'm not Detweiler. 
 Hell, somebody posted my correct address just a few hours ago (it was no 
secret; I am well aware of USENET indexing, and I've freely published my 
address and the correct, current phone number in a USENET area within the 
last couple of months, and I've never had an unlisted telephone number.
