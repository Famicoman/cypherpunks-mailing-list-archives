Came across this little gem on the web the other day.

I thought I'd post it - it's as sensible as most of the crap here.

Yours conspiratorially,
Noddy.

Summary: How the NSA has got help from extraterrtestrials

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing that the NSA will not reveal is the magnitude of their advancement
in theoretical mathematics and cryptography. It is estimated that the NSA is
about 200 years ahead of the rest of the world in mathematical theory. This
not only allows them to break any code devised outside of the NSA, but to
devise codes which cannot be broken.

A tiny part of this advancement is due to an intensive mathematics research
program commenced in the 1960s. Fermat's Last Theorem was proven
conclusively in 1964, but only those in the NSA know of it. Some 2,000
theorems and lemmas, all numbered and classified, have arisen. At least a
dozen branches of theoretical mathematics such as flag theory, superspace
theory, interstice theory, match theory and quantum logic have been
developed, and yet not only has the outside world never heard of them, but
the NSA has been deliberately inserting disinformation into textbooks,
research papers, et cetera to keep everybody else off the trail.

Most of this advancement has been achieved with outside help. In 1973,
during the Nixon Administration, the NSA hooked up fith the Jason Society,
the top-secret body that liaises with the extraterrestrial beings known as
the Grays. This gave them an immediate infusion of mathematical theory, as
the grays have developed mathematics to a level which we cannot completely
comprehend. In return, the grays were given two more bases in New Mexico and
a 15% increase in the number of people that they may abduct per year for
analysis and extraction of vital fluids.

The Grays have renegged on their abduction quota agreement, and are
abducting many more people than before. Most of these are returned, after
being implanted with a device which allows the grays to have total control
over their thoughts and actions. Approximately 40% of Americans now carry
one of these devices, which are impossible to remove without killing the
host.
