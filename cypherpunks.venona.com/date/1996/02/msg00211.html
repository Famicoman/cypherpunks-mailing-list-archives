The USG offers a $500,000 reward for stopping:

   Perception management and active measures activities.

The FBI DECA terms it one of seven "foreign intelligence 
activities that are deemed to be significant threats to  
U.S. national security interests."

_______________________________________________________
   
DECA (pronounced "DECK-UH") is the FBI's program for the
Development of Espionage, Counterintelligence and
Counterterrorism Awareness. The DECA program disseminates
information concerning national security matters.
   
The FBI is the lead counterintelligence agency in the
United States. It has the principal authority to conduct
and coordinate counterintelligence and counterterrorism
investigations and operations within the United States.
The FBI, supported by other U.S. agencies as needed,
conducts espionage investigations when the subject of the 
investigation is not under the jurisdiction of the
Department of Defense, Uniform Code of Military Justice.
_______________________________________________________
   
NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT LIST
   
The FBI's foreign counterintelligence mission is set out
in a strategy known as the National Security Threat List
(NSTL). The NSTL combines two elements:

*  First, it includes national security threat issues
   regardless of the country of origin.

*  Second, it includes a classified list of foreign
   powers that pose a strategic intelligence threat to
   U.S. security interests.

The issue threat portion of the NSTL was developed in
concert with the U.S. Intelligence Community and key
elements of the U.S. Government. As a result, the FBI
identified seven categories of foreign intelligence
activity that were deemed to be significant threats to 
U.S. national security interests. The FBI will
investigate the intelligence activities of any country
that are related to any of these seven issues. They are:

1. Proliferation of special weapons of mass destruction
   to include chemical, biological, nuclear, and delivery
   systems of those weapons of mass destruction.

2. Collection of information relating to defense
   establishments and related activities of national
   preparedness.

3. U.S. critical technologies as identified by the
   National Critical Technologies Panel.

4. Targeting of U.S. intelligence and foreign affairs
   information and U.S. Government officials.

5. Collection of U.S. industrial proprietary economic
   information and technology, the loss of which would
   undermine the U.S. strategic industrial position.

6. Clandestine foreign intelligence activity in the
   United States.

7. Perception management and active measures activities.

_______________________________________________________
    
NATIONAL CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES
   
Foreign intelligence activities directed at U.S. critical
technologies are of specific interest to the FBI. These
critical technologies are listed as follows:

   *  Materials:

      +  Materials synthesis and processing
      +  Electronic and photonic materials
      +  Ceramics
      +  Composites
      +  High-performance metals and alloys

   *  Manufacturing:

      +  Flexible computer-integrated manufacturing
      +  Intelligence processing equipment
      +  Micro- and nanofabrication
      +  Systems management technologies

   *  Information and communications:

      +  Software
      +  Micro and optoelectronics
      +  High-performance computing and networking
      +  High-definition imaging and displays
      +  Sensors and signal processing
      +  Data storage and peripherals
      +  Computer simulation and modeling

   *  Biotechnology and life sciences:

      +  Applied molecular biology
      +  Medical technology

   *  Aeronautics and surface transportation:

      +  Aeronautics
      +  Surface transportation technologies

   *  Energy and environment:

      +  Energy technologies
      +  Pollution minimization, remediation, and waste
         management

_______________________________________________________
   
National Security Begins With You
  
You may be the target of foreign intelligence activity if
you or your company are associated in any of the critical
technologies listed above. Foreign powers may also seek
to collect U.S. industrial proprietary economic
information and technology, the loss of which would
undermine the U.S. strategic industrial position. Foreign
intelligence collectors target corporate marketing
information in support of their nation's firms. Overseas
travel, foreign contact, and joint ventures may further
increase your exposure to the efforts of foreign
intelligence collectors. If you suspect possible foreign
intelligence activity, or have questions concerning the
National Security Threat List strategy, please contact
the FBI DECA Coordinator at the FBI Field Office nearest
you.

Up to $500,000 Reward for Stopping Espionage
  
An amendment to title 18 U.S.C. Section 3071, recently
enacted, authorizes the Attorney General to make payment
for information of espionage activity in any country
which leads to the arrest and conviction of any
person(s):

1. ...for commission of an act of espionage against the
   United States;

2. ...for conspiring or attempting to commit an act of
   espionage against the United States;

3. or which leads to the prevention or frustration of an
   act of espionage against the United States.

Specifics of this amendment can be obtained from any FBI
DECA Coordinator.

_______________________________________________________

FBI Contact Numbers:
   
To report suspected illegal intelligence or terrorism
activity against the interest of the United States,
telephone the DECA Coordinator at the FBI Field Office
nearest you.
