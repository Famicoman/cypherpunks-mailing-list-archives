I just sent this to the remailer operators' list, but it may be of interest
here too. I think Tim or Lucky or someone suggested something like GAI
(Government Access to Identities) here a while back....

&gt; &gt; Is it just me, or does this guy make a convincing case for the need for
&gt; &gt; remailers without ever showing one shred of evidence to back up his fear
&gt; &gt; mongering?
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. Ted Byfield mentioned on cpunks that it reads like a free
&gt; association session. I find the piece quite schizophrenic. (IANA 
&gt; psychologist :)  They alternate between fairly eloquent arguments for the
&gt; roots of remailers in fundamental principles of freedom and privacy, and 
&gt; the bizarre "anonymity as a disease" analogy. 
&gt; 
&gt; I hypothesize that the Strassmann &amp; Marlow paper is meant to lay the 
&gt; groundwork for some sort of eventual Government Access to Identities proposal
&gt; (which would more likely be termed "identity escrow" by the Feds). It's 
&gt; about the only way I can reconcile statements like the following 
&gt; (juxtaposed by me, not them):
&gt; 
&gt; 	"...it becomes politically unacceptable to suppress remailers
&gt; 	as potential sources of criminal acts. Such absolute 
&gt; 	prohibitions would never pass through a legislative process...."
&gt; 
&gt; 	"As in the case of [various diseases] it will take disasters
&gt; 	before the public may accept that some forms of restrictions
&gt; 	on the electronic freedom of speech and privacy may be
&gt; 	worthwhile."
&gt; 
&gt; 	"We trust that this will be seen as a useful contribution to an
&gt; 	already raging debate of how to find a balance between the
&gt; 	desirable and the dangerous."
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect the key phrases there are "absolute prohibitions", "some forms of
&gt; restrictions", and "find a balance". 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still surprised that the paper takes such a conciliatory stance towards
&gt; anonymity and pseudonymity. Strong crypto and GAK-free crypto have big 
&gt; corporate constituencies, but I see strong and GAI-free anonymity/pseudonymity
&gt; as much more vulnerable. I'm tempted to declare this a guarded preliminary
&gt; success of the cpunks remailer community -- we are seen as a viable player
&gt; in "the game", potentially capable of forcing at least a compromise on
&gt; nymity issues.
