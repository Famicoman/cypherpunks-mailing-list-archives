Sshhh!  You are not supposed to tell them that!

&gt;&gt; The "V-Chip" debate is a mirror of the one that occured when the cable

Yeah, I know it can be hacked.  I also know that if they are that interested
in sex, NOTHING I do is going to stop them.  (Which is as it should be.  If
they have no exposure to any sexual material as a youth, some rather nasty
problems tend to crop up as adults. (Take a look at the studies of sexual
predators.) But that is a point avoided by the moralists...)

&gt;&gt; You have to remember that most of the people arguing for TV filters are

&gt;A very good point.  One that makes me wary of V-Chips...

It makes me very wary of them.  What gets me are all the people here who
talk about them as if they will have useful features.  They will be about as
useful as the ratings on video games.  ("Hey, theres a cool one!  This one
has flying mangled bodies!  Its OK though.  No sex!")
