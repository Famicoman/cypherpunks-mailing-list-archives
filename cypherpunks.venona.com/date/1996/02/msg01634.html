&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Optical
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeaters have to pass your signal through an intermediate electronic
&gt; &gt; &gt; stage anyway, since we have no purely optical valve/transistor
&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalents (bosons don't interact with each other at all).
&gt; 
&gt; Dave Emery responds:
&gt; &gt; 	This is not true.   There is now a whole technology of optical
&gt; &gt; amplifiers for fiber communications systems that used Ettrium doped
&gt; &gt; fibers pumped with strong light from a laser at a slightly shorter
&gt; &gt; wavelength. These fiber optical amplifiers have gains in the order of
&gt; &gt; 10-12 db in a section of special doped fiber only about 10 feet long.
&gt; 
&gt; You're right, I do remember reading about these somewhere... didn't
&gt; realize they were already in use.

Optical amplifiers -  they are in use all right.  Want to buy one?
My employer sells them.  (get out a big checkbook though -
gotta cover my salary ;-)

&gt; Even so, I still don't think such a repeater would pass quantum-crypto
&gt; signals, excepting any photons that happened to just "leak" directly
&gt; through.  Your useful quantum state information resides in the
&gt; individual photons originally sent, and any even the optical repeaters
&gt; you describe achieve gain by by gating in *more* photons under the
&gt; incoming signal's control.  In so doing it will collapse the
&gt; wavefunctions of these incoming photons.
&gt; 
&gt; Not to say repeaters on the line aren't possible, but they'll have to
&gt; decode your data using a copy of the "secret" key, then re-encode for
&gt; transmission... so this will be a potential break-in point and need
&gt; good physical security.

This is essentially true for the purpose of quantum-crypto. 
The cascade of phontons triggered from the incoming photons would
mask most of your original phontons - necesitating a secure "repeater".


&gt; &gt; 	The current generation of undersea cables from the US to Europe
&gt; &gt; use these amplifiers instead of the more traditional regenerating
&gt; &gt; repeaters that convert the light to electronic signals, reclock the data
&gt; &gt; stream and convert it back to light with another laser diode.   There is
&gt; &gt; no conversion from light to digital electronic signals all the way from
&gt; &gt; Rhode Island to England - the same light pulses that go into the fiber
&gt; &gt; on one side of the Atlantic come out on the other end without ever
&gt; &gt; having been converted to electronic form in between.
&gt; 
&gt; You said power for the amps comes from a high-intensity,
&gt; shorter-wavelength beam... can this be superimposed on the original
&gt; signal at the point of origin, as with in-line coax-cable amplifiers?

Power for the amps must be electrical.  So, a seperate power cable must
be run seperate with the optical-fiber.  This normally isn't a problem
since the casing/etc of the fibers has lots of metal for protection anyways.

&gt; &gt; 	 These amplfiers have enourmous bandwidth, and can be used to
&gt; &gt; amplify several slightly different wavelengths of light allowing
&gt; &gt; wavelength division multiplexing of multiple streams of light flashes of
&gt; &gt; slightly different "colors" (all the current technology works at around
&gt; &gt; 1500 nm which is well into the infrared).   This can expand the capacity
&gt; &gt; of a single fiber to four to six times the 5 Gb/sec that is the current
&gt; &gt; state of the art.
&gt; 
&gt; Nice... :)
&gt; 
Very nice! ;-)  Flouride based amplifiers should be able to handle up
to 16 channels.  Using state of the art time-multiplex stuff of 10 Gb/sec
gives a total throughput of 160 Gb/Sec.... smoking!

Of course the parts for all of this will set you pack a sizeable 
chunk of change.

If you want to see some further reading about optical amplifiers
as applied in a telephone network - find a copy of "Telephony" 
a trade rag.  There is an article by John Moss and ??? here at Alcatel
that explains stuff in high level terms.  (little to no physics stuff)
