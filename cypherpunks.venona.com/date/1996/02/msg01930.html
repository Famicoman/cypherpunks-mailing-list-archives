Looks like Java might have some competition.  Perry and others who are
concerned that Java has inherent security flaws might want to get a word
in with the Bell Labs folks while the project is still in development.

&gt;BELL LABS, RITCHIE "DO SIMPLER RIVAL TO JAVA"
&gt;(February 20th 1995) AT&amp;T Corp's Bell Laboratories is working
&gt;feverishly on a rival to Sun Microsystems Inc's Java, according to
&gt;the San Jose Mercury News. The paper reckons that the project has
&gt;been accorded such a high priority that most of the 10 or so software
&gt;engineers working on the Plan 9 OS have been pulled off that to get
&gt;the new language, code-named Inferno, finished. 
&gt;
&gt;According to Silicon Valley's local paper, Dennis Ritchie, credited
&gt;with creating both Unix and C, made a brief reference to Inferno in a
&gt;speech last Tuesday night at UniForum and was reluctantly persuaded
&gt;to enlarge on it a little later. He said that while Java has been the
&gt;beneficiary of a lot of hype, the underlying idea behind it was
&gt;compelling, but he was worried that Java had become too large and
&gt;complex; he also suggested that any Bell Labs version would be useful
&gt;in a wider variety of machines, including future television sets.
&gt;"Java does not go far enough," he said. 
&gt;
&gt;Ritchie did not say how far along Inferno was, and implied that no
&gt;decision had been made about whether it would ever be brought to
&gt;market as a product. Bell Labs is of course in the early stages of
&gt;moving - not physically but in its allegiance - from AT&amp;T to the
&gt;$20,000m-a-year fledgling Lucent Technologies Inc.
