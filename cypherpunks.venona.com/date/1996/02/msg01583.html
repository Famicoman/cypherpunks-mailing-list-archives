Forwarded from alt.politics.datahighway, sorry I didn't
get the Message-ID when it was fowarded to me.

This is possibly old news to some, but I think it needs
to be spread widely.

 
&gt; Article 1706 of alt.politics.datahighway:
&gt; Date: Tue, 16 Jan 1996
&gt; Subject: NSA SHORTCIRCUITING FUTURE CRYPTO CAPABILITIES
&gt;
&gt; from Global Net News
&gt; ===
&gt; [Want to know the easiest way... Puzzle Palace coauthor Wayne
&gt; Madsen, in an article written for the June 1995 issue of Computer
&gt; Fraud &amp; Security Bulletin (Elsevier Advanced Technology Publications),
&gt; wrote that "according to well-placed sources within the Federal
&gt; Government and the Internet service provider industry, the National
&gt; Security Agency (NSA) is actively sniffing several key Internet router
&gt; and gateway hosts."
&gt;
&gt; Madsen says the NSA concentrates its surveillance on destination and
&gt; origination hosts, as well as "sniffing" for specific key words and
&gt; phrases.  He claims his sources have confirmed that the NSA has
&gt; contracted with an unnamed private company to develop the software
&gt; needed to capture Internet data of interest to the agency.
&gt;
&gt; According to Madsen, the NSA monitors traffic primarily at two Internet
&gt; routers controlled by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
&gt; (NASA), one in College Park, MD (dubbed "Fix East") and another at NASA
&gt; Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, CA ("Fix West").
&gt;
&gt; Other NSA Internet sniffers, he said, operate at busy routers knows as
&gt; Mae East (an East Coast hub), Mae West (a West Coast hub), CIX
&gt; (reportedly based in San Jose), and SWAB (a northern Virginia router
&gt; operated by Bell Atlantic).
&gt;
&gt; Madsen says the NSA may also be monitoring traffic at network access
&gt; points, the large Internet gateways operated by regional and
&gt; long-distance service providers. The NAPs allegedly under surveillance
&gt; are in Pennsauken, NJ (operated by Sprint), Chicago (run by AmeriTech
&gt; and Bell Communications Research), and San Francisco (Pacific Bell).
&gt;
&gt;    [Quote]
&gt;    "Madsen claims the NSA has deals with Microsoft, Lotus, and Netscape
&gt; to prevent anonymous email."
&gt;    [quote]
&gt;
&gt; "One senior Federal Government source has reported that NSA has been
&gt; particularly successful in convincing key members of the US software
&gt; industry to cooperate with it in producing software that makes Internet
&gt; messages easier for NSA to intercept, and if they are encrypted, to
&gt; decode," Madsen wrote. "A knowledgeable government source claims that
&gt; the NSA has concluded agreements with Microsoft, Lotus and Netscape to
&gt; permit the introduction of the means to prevent the anonymity of
&gt; Internet electronic mail, the use of cryptographic key-escrow, as well
&gt; as software industry acceptance of the NSA-developed Digital Signature
&gt; Standard (DSS)."
&gt;
&gt; Is the NSA really snooping on the Net? And if they are, would that
&gt; violate the agency's charter, which specifically prohibits it from
&gt; spying within the US?
&gt;
&gt; "Well, Net traffic is routed from God knows where to God knows where
&gt; around the world," says George Washington University Professor Lance
&gt; Hoffman, a professor of Communications and Telecommunications Systems
&gt; Policy at George Washington University. "So if the NSA is doing this,
&gt; they could say they are not violating their charter not to spy in the
&gt; US. That's the thing. Intelligent routers send stuff any which way."
