Now I have a firmer grasp on the dynamics of escalation. ;)
        A couple of notes. (1) The people Mr. Strassman CCed in his first
response remained CCed throughout; one of them is his co-author, William
Marlow (Senior Vice President, Science Applications International
Corporation [SAIC]). (2) He hasn't responded to my last mail, and probably
won't, at least in private; obviously, he's free to respond to it on
Cypherpunks. (3) I find his claims to understand and properly represent the
arguments for remailers to be, er, lacking: claims like "remailing
capabilities are operated [...] as a public service, almost always at no
charge because it costs so little to set one up," the absence of the
standard penet-type arguments--about support-group discussion re sexual
abuse etc.--speak for themselves, imo.
        Anyway:

&gt;
&gt;Greetings.
&gt;        Your article on remailers &lt;<A  HREF="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/">http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/</A>
&gt;anon-remail.html&gt; was fascinating.
&gt;        The "connection" you draw between disease and techniques of
&gt;anonymity is arbitrary and tendentious: in place of a careful, sustained
&gt;analysis of anonymous remailers _as such_, your article relies on a
&gt;bizarre rhetorical substitution of disease for anonymity--"Information
&gt;terrorism poses a threat; anonymity prevents punishment; the fact that
&gt;legislative and policy bodies aren't dealing with the issue reminds me of
&gt;the history of public medicine; therefore anonymity is a disease like
&gt;AIDS; Russian criminals are using remailers; this is how remailers
&gt;work..." This isn't an argument--it's a hodgepodge of free-associations
&gt;and very peculiar allegations. What evidence is there that "the Russian
&gt;(ex-KGB) criminal element" (whatever that is) constitutes a *statistically
&gt;significant* segment of remailer-users? If they aren't statisticaly
&gt;significant, why mention them? In the absence of any specific evidence, I
&gt;can only assume that this claim is pure fantasy--like the confusing
&gt;association between "AIDS" and "terrorism." Certainly, both are bad for
&gt;society, but so are many other things--littering, starvation, and poor
&gt;workmanship.
&gt;        If you plan to develop your work on remailers further and present
&gt;it to governmental agencies and NGOs, please take the time to *understand*
&gt;the arguments of remailer advocates, rather than merely quoting them at
&gt;length. You'll be doing yourself a favor--because, really, the only
&gt;sections of your article that seem to make much sense are the quotations
&gt;from people who develop and maintain remailers.

&gt;
&gt; Dear Mr. Byfield:
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your comments about our remailer paper. I believe a few points
&gt;are in order in response to your observations:
&gt;
&gt;1. It does not seem that you have finished reading the paper. There is a
&gt;long section in the end captioned &lt;Why Remailers?&gt; which summarizes a wide
&gt;spectrum of opinions and beliefs of those who develop and offer remailer
&gt;services. I am satisfied that I have represented fairly the views of those
&gt;who see in remailers the defense of privacy and civil liberties. I also
&gt;conclude that remailers are here to stay.
&gt;
&gt;2. With regard to the evidence of that remailers are used by the criminal
&gt;element, and particularly by the Russian (ex-KGB), I am satisfied with the
&gt;evidence I have seen so far. As court proceedings become unsealed, everyone
&gt;will have an opportunity to examine that evidence. Meanwhile, you may wish
&gt;to browse for recent stories with the keywords &lt;Citicorp&gt; and &lt;Cybercrime&gt;
&gt;for such disclosures.
&gt;
&gt;3. In your letter you employ a technique which is not appropriate for the
&gt;conduct of a civilized discourse. You start by  attributing to me
&gt;statements which I did not make. Then, you proceed to debunk them. Let me
&gt;illustrate:
&gt;
&gt;I did not use the expression "statistically significant" in describing the
&gt;use of remailers by the criminal element. Therefore, your argument "...if
&gt;they aren't statistically significant why mention them?" is both false as
&gt;well as logically inconsistent.
&gt;
&gt;Your debating style shows similar flaws by avoiding facts and arguing your
&gt;own constructs of what you attribute as my views. It is only because of the
&gt;importance of this subject matter that I have decided to respond to your
&gt;"flame".
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;Paul Strassmann

&gt;
&gt;Mr. Strassmann--
&gt;        Since you may not wish to pursue any further discussion with
&gt;someone you don't know, I'll cut to the chase: may I submit your response
&gt;(unabridged) to the Cypherpunks mailing list? I notice that you've CCed my
&gt;mail to three people unknown to me without my permission. (Hi,
&gt;everyone...)
&gt;        Here are a few further remarks, if you're interested; I hope you are.
&gt;I've reproduced your remarks out of their original order for purposes of
&gt;brevity.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;3. In your letter you employ a technique which is not appropriate for the
&gt;&gt;conduct of a civilized discourse. You start by  attributing to me
&gt;&gt;statements which I did not make. Then, you proceed to debunk them. Let me
&gt;&gt;illustrate:
&gt;
&gt;        You are, I trust, familiar with the phenomenon commonly called
&gt;"asking a question"? That is what I did when I asked you whether Russian
&gt;criminal elements constitute a statistically significant segment of
&gt;remailer users: I asked you a question. This process can sometimes be
&gt;confusing--for example, when the criteria that questioner and questionee
&gt;judge to be important differ. I feel that, in matters of public policy,
&gt;relative numbers are important: thus, if tens or hundreds of thousands of
&gt;people use remailers for benign purposes while only a handful of Russian
&gt;criminals do so for nefarious purposes, then public policy decisions on
&gt;remailers should not be founded primarily on the latter fact. By analogy,
&gt;it seems likely that someone, somewhere, has taught a monkey to drive a
&gt;car--there might even be a documented instance of it; should we then take
&gt;this into consideration in debating national automotive policy? After all,
&gt;if it weren't illegalized, the chaos that could be caused by pet
&gt;chimpanzees tooling around on public roads can't be understated...
&gt;        Obviously, you're free to differ on the subject of relative
&gt;numbers and their bearing on policy, just as you're free to persevere
&gt;under the belief that a question can be "false."
&gt;        I can't, however, resist pointing out that asking c[are]fully
&gt;worded questions that conform to established scientific criteria is
&gt;considered "appropriate for the conduct of a civilized discourse." Again,
&gt;you're free to disagree, of course. [brackets in 1st line = spelling
&gt;correction]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;2. With regard to the evidence of that remailers are used by the criminal
&gt;&gt;element, and particularly by the Russian (ex-KGB), I am satisfied with the
&gt;&gt;evidence I have seen so far. As court proceedings become unsealed, everyone
&gt;&gt;will have an opportunity to examine that evidence. Meanwhile, you may wish
&gt;&gt;to browse for recent stories with the keywords &lt;Citicorp&gt; and &lt;Cybercrime&gt;
&gt;&gt;for such disclosures.
&gt;
&gt;        "If you knew what I knew" arguments have needlessly become a
&gt;staple of the national security establishment; but in all but the rarest
&gt;instances are they a valid basis for policy decisions. I understand full
&gt;well that the Russian "mafia" and former apparatchiks throughout the
&gt;former Soviet bloc are serious problems that we ignore only at our peril;
&gt;and, also, that invoking them increases one's chance of funding in the
&gt;security establishment. But I also understand that certain segments of the
&gt;USG would ultimately be better off distinguishing between its citizenry
&gt;and the Russian mob, rather than continually invoking the latter in
&gt;advocating legislation that pertains primarily to the former.
&gt;
&gt;        In any case, I cannot wish you well in your endeavors in this
&gt;regard, since I disagree with most of what you say; I can, however, wish
&gt;you well in other regards, and I do.
&gt;        Please take a moment to answer my original question regarding the
&gt;Cypherpunks mailing list.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
&gt;Ted Byfield

&gt;
&gt;I have no problem with your posting my messages. Thanks for asking except
&gt;you should do so only after you include the text of all messages, including
&gt;this one.
&gt;
&gt;You have totally  misunderstood my response to your points about the
&gt;relevance of whether ex-KGB criminals ( or monkeys)  are a statistically
&gt;significant number. The problem with your communications has been that you
&gt;have continued to disregard my conclusions where I stated that anonymous
&gt;remailers are here to stay for good reasons. Whether the number of abusers
&gt;is or is not statistically significant has therefore no bearing on our
&gt;exchanges. For that reason I did not read your text at all as "asking a
&gt;question", but as your own assertion. This makes it unacceptable as an
&gt;argument.
&gt;
&gt;I disagree with  your assertion that you have "...asked a carefully worded
&gt; questions that conform to established scientific criteria." My experience
&gt; as editor of several scientific journals prevents me from acknowledging
&gt; your messages as conforming to any scientific criteria. You have
&gt; selectively picked arguments from the front of my paper, while totally
&gt; disregarding what I said at the end. What you have is not scientific, but
&gt; extractions to support  your arguments.
&gt;
&gt;You are using inference (such as "chance of funding the security
&gt;establishment", "advocating legislation" etc.) for attributing to me what
&gt;you see as reprehensible views. You do that by saying that I have used the
&gt;"if you knew what I knew" arguments as a cover. Again, you are exhibiting a
&gt;debating technique where you assign to me a position I have not taken and
&gt;then proceed to argue against it.
&gt;
&gt;Let me repeat again, your allegation that I have not taken into
&gt;consideration the arguments of remailer advocates is not only  false but
&gt;totally misleading. If you would  bother to read the entire paper, you
&gt;would  find that the  views or remailer advocates are not only represented,
&gt;but found to be of sufficient weight and importance to warrant my
&gt;conclusion that anonymous remailers are here to stay. I also say  that in a
&gt;democratic society it "...becomes politically unacceptable  to designate
&gt;remailers as a potential source of criminal actions. Such absolute
&gt;prohibitions would never pass through a legislative process in a free
&gt;society."
&gt;
&gt;If you are looking for some totalitarian monster, you better look somewhere
&gt;else to vent your apprehensions.

&gt;&gt;question", but as your own assertion. This makes it unacceptable as an
&gt;&gt;argument.
&gt;
&gt;        You seem quite adamant that your repeated assertion that
&gt;"remailers are here to stay" somehow serves to stave off any criticism (or
&gt;at least any criticism from your struly) of your article. I read your
&gt;article in its entirety and understood it quite well, and I agree with
&gt;*some* of it--for example, with your conclusion that remailers are here to
&gt;stay. I could just as easily read some lngthy tome full of rubbish whose
&gt;conclusion is that "stuff exists" and agree with its conclusion while
&gt;remaining skeptical about the bulk of the book.
&gt;        I would submit to you that your article would be much improved if
&gt;you edited out this pathological-biological metaphor.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I disagree with  your assertion that you have "...asked a carefully worded
&gt;&gt; questions that conform to established scientific criteria." My experience
&gt;&gt; as editor of several scientific journals prevents me from acknowledging
&gt;&gt; your messages as conforming to any scientific criteria. You have
&gt;&gt; selectively picked arguments from the front of my paper, while totally
&gt;&gt; disregarding what I said at the end. What you have is not scientific, but
&gt;&gt; extractions to support  your arguments.
&gt;
&gt;        Of course I've selectively picked arguments from your paper--I
&gt;even addressed some from the *middle*! (As for the end, see my remarks
&gt;above.) Unfortunately, try as you might, my remarks aren't really what's
&gt;at issue here. You published an article that made extensive use of dubious
&gt;metaphor and made unsubstantiated allegations that, even if they were
&gt;substantiated, are of doubtful significance; when I pointed out that this
&gt;method of argumentation is generally inappropriate for a democratic
&gt;society, you redouble your efforts to assess my reading comprehension as
&gt;low and my remarks as utterly without merit.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;You are using inference (such as "chance of funding the security
&gt;&gt;establishment", "advocating legislation" etc.) for attributing to me what
&gt;&gt;you see as reprehensible views. You do that by saying that I have used the
&gt;&gt;"if you knew what I knew" arguments as a cover. Again, you are exhibiting a
&gt;&gt;debating technique where you assign to me a position I have not taken and
&gt;&gt;then proceed to argue against it.
&gt;
&gt;        I've said nothing of "reprehensible views," nor need I do so; I'm
&gt;quite content with merely _disagreeing_ with some of what you have
&gt;written. As for "assign[ing] to you a position [you] have not taken": (1)
&gt;in your article you mentioned that "the Russian (ex-KGB) element" uses
&gt;remailers; (2) I questioned the truth and noteworthiness of this claim;
&gt;(3) you responded...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;2. With regard to the evidence of that remailers are used by the criminal
&gt;&gt;element, and particularly by the Russian (ex-KGB), I am satisfied with the
&gt;&gt;evidence I have seen so far. As court proceedings become unsealed, everyone
&gt;&gt;will have an opportunity to examine that evidence. Meanwhile, you may wish
&gt;&gt;to browse for recent stories with the keywords &lt;Citicorp&gt; and &lt;Cybercrime&gt;
&gt;&gt;for such disclosures.
&gt;
&gt;        ...very clearly asserting that you have seen evidence that is not
&gt;publicly availlable because it remains sealed: "if you knew what I knew,"
&gt;in shorthand. (4) I said that, imo, by and large this is not a valid basis
&gt;for policy decisions. And now you tell me that I'm arguing against a
&gt;position you haven't taken?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Let me repeat again, your allegation that I have not taken into
&gt;&gt;consideration the arguments of remailer advocates is not only  false but
&gt;&gt;totally misleading. If you would  bother to read the entire paper, you
&gt;&gt;would  find that the  views or remailer advocates are not only represented,
&gt;&gt;but found to be of sufficient weight and importance to warrant my
&gt;&gt;conclusion that anonymous remailers are here to stay. I also say  that in a
&gt;&gt;democratic society it "...becomes politically unacceptable  to designate
&gt;&gt;remailers as a potential source of criminal actions. Such absolute
&gt;&gt;prohibitions would never pass through a legislative process in a free
&gt;&gt;society."
&gt;
&gt;        To be sure, you "represent" the views of remailer advocates,
&gt;though for the most part through extensive quotation--extensive enough,
&gt;indeed, that one of the authors quoted has publicly expressed misgivings
&gt;about the fact that you never sought permissions. Editor of several
&gt;scientific journals, you say? Perhaps your extensive experience with
&gt;classified documents, which of course quote material beyond fair use
&gt;without permission, has shaped your editorial sensibilities?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you are looking for some totalitarian monster, you better look somewhere
&gt;&gt;else to vent your apprehensions.
&gt;
&gt;        I think maybe you've strayed a bit from the subject. This is, I
&gt;think, a strange way to respond to my closing:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;        In any case, I cannot wish you well in your endeavors in this regard,
&gt;&gt;since I disagree with most of what you say; I can, however, wish you well in
&gt;&gt;other regards, and I do.
&gt;
&gt;        You're rather keen to pathologize things, aren't you? First it's
&gt;remailers, which "remind" you of diseases; and now you've doubly
&gt;pathologized me, as someone positively bent on finding "totalitarian
&gt;monsters" where there are none. Please rest assured that I don't think
&gt;you're anything of the sort.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Ted
