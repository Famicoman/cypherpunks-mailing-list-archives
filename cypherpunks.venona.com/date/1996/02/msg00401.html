    attila sez:

	well, I take it as assumed correct that illegally violating the
    credit and personal information of member os Congress (might as well 
    include the Clintons and the Gores) would get a response on privacy.

	but you would be a targt of an incredible manhunt. For example,
    I can give you the name of an online information provider (if I was
    so disposed --which I am _not_, as I do not wish to be labelled as a 
    conspirator) who would provide the credit, medical, and background 
    reports of 500+ individuals for $20-25 a pop.  then you take out an 
    account on a system with a false id and does not require credit cards 
    (pay cash, not cheque)  --mail each one to the target rep/sen/bubba 
    after mailing the whole set to Geraldo, or some other slimball.

	but, I think I would put my money on further laws to really 
    clamp down on free speech. and, if you ever were caught, don't 
    expect all of us to donate one day a month for 10-50 years to visit
    you in the slammer.

	more laws, more political police, more prisons  --that's their 
    motto. 

	enjoy

&gt; It is impossible to get changes in the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the
&gt; traditional way. Credit reporting agencies have far too much personal
&gt; information that is passed out with incrediable ease at the consumers expense. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a suggestion! 
&gt; 
&gt; Today, with TRW, Equifax and TransUnion's vast network, it is easy to obtain
&gt; anyone's credit report from various sources. Do you think if someone,
&gt; outside of the USA, obtained the credit reports on half, maybe all, of the
&gt; US Senators, congressmen, judges, etc, and published them in their entirity,
&gt; on the internet, from outside the US, would get their attention? Then there
&gt; would be changes, overnight, protecting the right of privacy! Let them
&gt; become the victim of credit reporting agencies once and shit will happen
&gt; overnight. 
&gt; 
&gt; If someone who is not a US citizen does this from outside the US, I don't
&gt; think that they can be held accountable under US law? I am new to the
&gt; internet and don't have a clue how to do it, but someone out there does and
&gt; probably has a friend in Bankok that will help him. Put the word out!
