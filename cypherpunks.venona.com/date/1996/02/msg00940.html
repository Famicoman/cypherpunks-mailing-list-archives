I deeply appreciate your quandary.

Needless to say, _I_ know which I am, and what my motivations are.  But 
there are a few clues which might assist you:

1.  Most "government sponsored provocateurism" is given substantially more 
publicity than the meager amount I've managed to acquire on FIDOnet, USENET, 
and CP.  You can well imagine that if the government were trying to use an 
"Assassination Politics"-type scenario to drum up support for Clipper-type 
and FBI-wiretap ideas, they'd do a better job getting the word out.

2.  I think I've tried to make it clear that I believe that this idea is 
technically inevitable; it will occur REGARDLESS of the efforts which 
attempt to resist it.  If this were "government-sponsored provocateurism,"  
I would have added something to the effect that "This is going to happen 
unless [fill in the blank with something the government wants to do to 
us...]". 

3.  "Watch this space"   If you still have any residual doubts, and think I 
might be in league with the government on this, wait a few months.  You'll 
be astonished.


&gt;However, it takes guts and thick skin to advocate overthrow of 
&gt;authority, knowing that reasonable people will think you're a 
&gt;nut seeking celebrity martyrdom.

Well, it's not like I'm SEEKING martyrdom, but the possibilities have 
certainly crossed my mind. Some people have suggested, and only partially in 
jest, that I may be one of the system's first victims.  They may be right.  
Nevertheless, I was undeterred, as evidenced by the fact that I published 
the essay anyway.


&gt;Happily for the careers of agent-and-anarchist back-stabbing 
&gt;back-scratchers, there is no easy way to know for sure which is 
&gt;which, or even if there's any difference when the media 
&gt;juggernauts are provocateuring both roles for melodramatic 
&gt;infotainment.

My idea has already resulted in an article in the Asahi Evening News 
newspaper, an English-language newspaper for residents of Japan.  A copy of 
this article was mailed to me a couple days ago.  It may also result in a (I 
hope positive) screenplay.  FAR more exciting that "The Net."
