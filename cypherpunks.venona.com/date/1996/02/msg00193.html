-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I wrote a Java program to analyze the the PGP web of trust and I've
documented it on some web pages.  They include information on the
strongly connected components (the largest has 1291 keys in it), the
longest "shortest-path" (21 signatures long), the 'central trustee'
and 'central truster', the mean path length (6.4, by one definition), etc.

(For those who saw the earlier version, I've fixed some small bugs.)

There is a lot of useful information here for folks who want to
improve the connectivity of the public PGP web of trust.

Cheers,

                           PGP Keyserver Statistics
                                       
   This is an analysis of the web of trust among users of the leading
   technology in the world of secure email communications, Pretty Good
   Privacy (PGP). See the [1]PGP Frequently Asked Questions for more
   information on PGP itself and other related tools.
   
   There is a set of public key servers around the world which allow PGP
   users to register their keys and publicly sign each other's keys via
   [2]email and [3]WWW interfaces. This analysis is based on the public
   keyring obtained from
   [4]<A  HREF="ftp://ftp.uit.no/pub/crypto/pgp/keys/pubring.pgp">ftp://ftp.uit.no/pub/crypto/pgp/keys/pubring.pgp</A> on _1 Jan 1996_.
   For comparative analysis, here is the [5]Jan 1 version (7,976,108
   bytes long). I could also provide a shorter and simpler file format
   which just lists which keyIDs signed which keyIDs. If there is
   interest, updates can be provided.
   
Overall Statistics


Public keys submitted ('pub'):          19124
Signatures ('sig'):                     28031
Total number of unique keys referenced: 21107
Revoked keys:                           839

Self-signed keyIDs:                     7300
Other unique keyID-signs-keyID pairs:   17908

   Note that less than half of the keys are signed by themselves. People
   should _always sign their own UserID_ on their own key! Otherwise,
   someone else can surreptitiously change the email address in order to
   encourage correspondents to send email to the wrong place.
   
   Only about 1/3 of the keys are signed by at least one another key, and
   only 1/6 have 2 signatures.
   
     To be a "good PGP-citizen", you should
     * Be very careful about signing keys. Have first-hand knowledge
       based on hard-to-forge communications that the key's fingerprint
       (pgp -kvc) in your keyring matches the user's real fingerprint.
     * Sign the keys of at least two other people
     * Get at least two signatures on your own key.
     * Extra credit: Sponsor a [6]key-signing party
       
Strongly-Connected Components

   A 'strongly-connected' set of keys is defined as a set in which every
   key leads to every other key via some chain of signatures (aka
   signature path). Note that we are not incorporating any PGP-specific
   rules for establishing trust (e.g. the default CERT_DEPTH of 4, the
   default requirement for two 'marginally trusted' introducers to
   establish trust, etc.).
   
   After running pgp -kc on the keyring (with MIT PGP 2.6.2, for almost 2
   days...) the number of signatures dropped from 28031 to 25810,
   presumably because some old signatures where thrown out. The analysis
   here was done with the original keyring, so all versions of PGP will
   not recognize all the signatures which are accepted here.
   
   Note that the program used for this analysis (pgpstat.java) so far
   only deals with keyID-keyID relationships, rather than dealing
   separately with each keyID/UserID pair. It does properly ignore
   revoked keys.

Size of 'strong': largest strongly-connected component: 1291
Size of 'signees': keys signed by 'strong':             2775
Size of 'signers': keys which sign 'strong':            2001

   The [7]largest strongly-connected component of this keyring (the set
   names 'strong') has 1291 keys in it. The [8]next-largest
   strongly-connected component has only 16 keys in it. There are another
   1484 keys which are directly or indirectly signed by at least one key
   in 'strong' but which do not sign any key in 'strong' and are thus not
   in the strongly-connected component, for a total of 2775 keys in the
   'signees' set that can be reached from the 'strong' set. Similarly,
   there are a total of 2001 keys in the 'signers' set which directly or
   indirectly sign at least one key in the strong component.
   
Shortest-Path Distances

   Using a breadth-first search of the keyspace, we can calculate the
   shortest path from one keyID to other keyIDs it has directly or
   indirectly signed.

Mean distance from strong keyIDs to signees:    6.41189
Mean distance to strong keyIDs from signers:    6.70961

Maximum shortest-path distance:                 21

   First, for each key in 'strong', we compute the mean length of the
   shortest path necessary to reach each key in 'signees': 6.41189. Next
   we do the converse, following paths of signatures into the strong
   component rather than out of it. The mean distances are different
   because a different set of keys is involved: signers vs signees.
   
   Finally, we note that there are several pairs of keys which have a
   shortest path distance of 21 between them. Here is the [9]example
   path, between these two keys:

6CB05C95 Karl F. Scheibner &lt;scheibner@llnl.gov&gt;
82996935 Brett Dubroy &lt;1:225/357@fidonet.org&gt;

   Anyone who is along this path can improve the tightness of the web of
   trust by finding someone they know further along the path and
   carefully signing their key.
   
Centers of Trust: the Central Trustee and Central Truster

   By examining the shortest-path data more closely we can identify the
   keys which are closest to the 'center' of the web of trust. The
   'central trustee' is the key which is signed most directly by others:
   the key which has the shortest mean distance from all of the
   'signers'. Here is the current "top 10":

Mean    Max     KeyID           UserID

4.48426 12      8E0A49D1        Wolfgang Ley, DFN-CERT &lt;ley@cert.dfn.de&gt;

   You can also get the [10]full list by mean distance.
   
   Here is the [11]distance to the cental trustee from the each of the
   signers along with info on how many keys sign and are signed by each
   key.
   
   The converse of this is the 'central truster', the key which trusts
   other keys most directly:

   You can also get the [12]full list by mean distance.
   
   Here is the [13]distance to each of the 'signees' from the central
   truster, along with info on how many keys sign and are signed by each
   key.
   
Further Questions

   Many other aspects of the web of trust could be explored.
     * It is important that the web be multiply-connected. p Good
       software to do bi-connectivity (or tri-connectivity, etc.) for
       directed graphs would be useful, especially if it identifies the
       most significant articulation points (keys which are critical for
       the connection of big pieces of the web).
     * Identification of large cliques or near-cliques (sets of keys
       which all sign each other, related to coloring problem, very
       hard.)
     * Software to generate a high-level graphical view would be useful.
       For example, a directed-acyclic-graph of the connectivity of the
       larger strongly-connected components would be interesting.
     * It shouldn't be too hard to make pgpstat.java into a server which
       could answer custom queries (shortest path from x to y, size of
       component that x is in, suggestions for who might be able to sign
       your key (e.g. other keys from the strongly-connected component
       which are in your domain), etc.)
       
Tools

   The analysis tool, pgpstat.java, is an application written in the very
   nice new language [14]Java (Perl just doesn't have any decent
   hierarchical data structure support...). Source code will probably be
   made available after some cleaning-up for others who want to explore
   different keyrings or other avenues of analysis.
   
   Performance note: the algorithms used here mostly scale linearly in
   time complexity, based on the sum of the numbers of keys and
   signatures. In particular this is true for the code that finds the
   strongly-connected components (thanks to a favorite professor of mine,
   Bob Sedgewick, and his "Algorithms" book!)
   
   The one notable exception is finding the centers of trust and the
   longest shortest-path, which is quadratic in the size of the connected
   set, but doesn't have to be computed nearly as often, as a practical
   matter. The full analysis took less than 30 minutes using one
   processor on a Sun Sparc 1000 (50 Mhz?). There are lots of
   opportunities for optimization, and hopefully non-quadratic algorithms
   for at least approximating the center/longest path problems.
   
   Please let me know if you have any feedback on this analysis.
