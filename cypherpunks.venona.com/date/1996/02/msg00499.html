MESSAGE FROM ZIMMERMANN DEFENSE TEAM

FOR IMMEDIATE WIDE DISTRIBUTION WITHOUT MODIFICATION

I write on behalf of Philip Zimmermann and his legal defense team 
for two reasons:  to offer thanks and to make an announcement.  

First, we offer our thanks to all the generous souls who donated 
money and services to the Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund.  Without 
you, we could not have mounted the defense that we did, and we 
would not have achieved the result that we did.  Your contributions
were made from a commitment to the causes of privacy and justice,
and we are grateful.

The announcement:  as you may know, I am the only lawyer who 
was not working pro bono, i.e., without expectation of being 
paid.  Three of our lawyers-- Ken Bass in D.C., Eben Moglen in New 
York, and Curt Karnow in San Francisco-- devoted hundreds of 
hours of time and substantial expenses for which they've not been 
paid.  Tom Nolan in Palo Alto and Bob Corn-Revere in D.C. also 
spent a great deal of time on this case for which they were not 
paid.  And, of course, Joe Burton in San Francisco toiled in 
obscurity on behalf of the other person who was also targeted by
the federal investigation.

I agreed up front not to bill for all my time, and judging from 
the rate of current contributions, it now appears that the Defense 
Fund will cover the fees and costs that I billed.  I would like to 
see these other lawyers receive some compensation for their efforts.
Accordingly, all donations to the Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund 
mailed, authorized, or generally "made" (as opposed to "received") 
after midnight local time on 14 February 1996 will be distributed
among these other lawyers to defray their costs and, if possible, 
to compensate them for a little of their time.

I make this announcement because people contributing to the Fund 
have a right to know that Mr. Zimmermann's actual defense costs 
are now covered and that additional donations will go to lawyers 
who agreed to work for free and who were absolutely essential to 
the defense.

Again, my thanks.
