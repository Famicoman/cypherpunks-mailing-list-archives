&gt;You probably had no problem with manditory airbags, public building smoke
&gt;alarms, unleaded
&gt;fuel, restaurant health codes,etc....Because they protected you and or
&gt;people you care about,
&gt;even though they cost YOU more money.

You are your child's seat belt for the internet.  There are plenty of tools
at your disposal that do not require govt. intervention.  As for the
television, I'm sure you already have my email on that.  I also don't have
problems with eviornmental regulations, labor codes, electronic safety
standards for computers and such even though those cost me money as well.
All of those laws, however, do not restrict my freedom of speech.  If not
wearing a seat is your idea of free speech, I personally can't vouch for
your intelegence (I can't do that anyway:-)), but you still have the right
to speak your mind on the matter, as you are now.  People talking about gay
rights, abortion options, better sex (a la Dr. Ruth) can no longer do that
on the net without wondering whether they are in violation of the bill or
not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; All I'm saying is it's tough to raise a child these days without the added
&gt;&gt; &gt; distortion of modern programing ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; ... and parents need not be denied any tool that can help them
&gt;&gt; &gt; achieve success.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Oh, OK then.  Parents should be given access to incendiary equipment
&gt;&gt;as a tool to destroy the studios that produce offensive material.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;It's obvious that you watch a lot television your an excellent sensationalist.
&gt;Besides, we both no that the cost of the chip is insignificant. This device
&gt;hurts no one!

I "no" no such thing.  The price of the chip has been estimated to be
higher than was stated tonight on the news, that's for sure.  (Anyone got a
figure?  I'd like to hear how much the TV makers will think it will cost.)

On the meridian of time there is no injustice, only the poetry of motion
creating the illusion of truth and drama.
