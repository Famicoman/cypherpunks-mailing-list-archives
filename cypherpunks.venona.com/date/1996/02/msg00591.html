&gt;        I had been working on a series of questions/problems with the
&gt;Assasination Politics idea as initially presented, to be sent to Jim and to
&gt;people on the NWLIBERTARIANS list, as he requested, but you've kind of
&gt;preempted one of them.
&gt;
&gt;From:   IN%"lunaslide@loop.com"  7-FEB-1996 06:57:58.30

&lt;rm&gt;

&gt;&gt;Organization B would thrive, make no mistake.  And the people who would be
&gt;getting in on all the action are the rich.  All the politicians who oppose
&gt;their interests would be hit immediately.  Anyone trying to change the
&gt;status quo would be eliminated.  Why do you think we are still using
&gt;combustion engines in the last decade of the 20th century?  We could have
&gt;had better alternatives 20 years ago, but the oil companies would loose out
&gt;so they have either bought out these ideas or had killed the inventors and
&gt;bought their patents and are sitting on them.  A capitalist economy does
&gt;not always breed competition that brings out the best and most desireable
&gt;products because some advancements are bad for all the businesses involved
&gt;in that market.   Big business and the rich would benifit the most from the
&gt;Assination Politics model.
&gt;------------------------
&gt;        Umm.... as much as it seems otherwise, this is not ConspiracyPunks.
&gt;Actually, the involvement of wealth instead of votes (the first can be lost,
&gt;the second cannot) is an argument in _favor_ of Assasination Politics. I
&gt;generally have the objection to most anarcho-capitalist systems that the
&gt;average person does not have enough foresight to do the kind of banding
&gt;together most of them require. This one has the advantage of increased power to
&gt;the wealthy, who have enough foresight to gain their wealth (or at least
&gt;keep it, in the case of inheritance).

:-)  That's exactly what I was afraid of (ConspiricyPunks).  My point is
not to drag out conspiricy arguments.  I am trying to state that the
balance of power would remain lopsided in the direction it has been, even
with the new system; the power would remain with the rich.  Are you saying
that just because the average person is not rich, they do not deserve the
same voting power as the rich?  I must remind *you* that this is not
alt.elitism either ;-)

&gt;&gt;But what if OrgB stops taking donations for "predictions" for
&gt;"Non-Initiation Of Force Principle" (NIOFP) offenders?  Some other
&gt;organization will crop up to take their place AND the people operating OrgB
&gt;could be hit for their "ethical" action.  There is simply too much
&gt;opportunity offered by OrgB type organizations for people to pass up.  They
&gt;will not let the higher prices stop them.
&gt;
&gt;If the answer to that problem is to regulate the lists of "victims", then
&gt;the next question is who are these people who are regulating and what
&gt;guidelines are they following?  Who decides who gets to be the moderators?
&gt;Could there be exceptions to the (NIOFP)-offender standard?  Who would they
&gt;be and why?    Could the organizations be anonymous as well?  How would the
&gt;money be transmitted to them in that case?  How can we trust or redress
&gt;grivances with an organization?  There are still many concerns regarding
&gt;the organizations.  If the organizations fail, the whole system fails.
&gt;---------------------
&gt;        The organizations themselves can be perfectly anonymous, especially
&gt;with some improvements onto the basic system that I am considering (and
&gt;researching). One idea to keep things more honest would be a "deathstamping"
&gt;organization, which would be above-board and have the "legitimate" function of
&gt;ecash life insurance (I'll explain further later).

That "deathstamping" organization would then become the new govt. and would
be just as vunerable to corruption as any other govt, except that now we
don't even know who the unjust leaders are!  I await your further
explainations.

Respectfully,
Jeff Conn

On the meridian of time there is no injustice, only the poetry of motion
creating the illusion of truth and drama.
