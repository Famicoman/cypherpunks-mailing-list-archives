&gt;The first paragraph here bothered me.  If a user (or an organization)

This is my perception, too, though I haven't been in Corporate America for
almost a decade. Still, I would encourage people to take this position,
that "we don't need no steenking key escrow!" (to borrow again the B.
Traven phrase I used yesterday)

&gt;hall Bob has some, too.  If I get hit by the bus, they can get my company
&gt;related data back.  We don't need any "service" or "licensee" or "trusted
&gt;third party" or any of that, thank you very much.  And we don't need any
&gt;one developing OTPs for us either, and we don't need government agencies
&gt;keeping copies of any of our keys.

Bravo!

And we should all remember, again, that basic observation: even if "key
escrow" is needed to recover *stored* files, it sure ain't needed for
*communications*!!

The only entity that really has a compelling need for "key escrow" for
_communications_ is Big Bro himself, nto companies or individuals. Think
about it.

TIS is just playing the shill role for Big Brother and the Holding Company.

Russell, American Reporter Correspondent....You motherfuckers in Congress
have dropped over the edge of the earth this time... "the sorriest bunch
of cocksuckers ever to sell out the First Amendment" or suggesting that
"the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists'
dicks and fuck the people who sent you there," ....any more than I care
for the language you shitheads have forced me to use in this
essay...Let's talk about this fucking indecent language bullshit.
