&gt;&gt;What is described is not self-defence by any stretch of the imagination. It
&gt;is a pre-meditated act which causes any plea of self-defence to fail.
&gt;------------------
&gt;	If someone has comitted serious enough violations of rights in the
&gt;past, then I would call killing that person justified. First, it prevents any
&gt;future violations of rights by that person. Second, it serves to discourage
&gt;people if they know they can get killed if they do so. (I realize that
&gt;capital punishment by governments doesn't appear to do much good, but the
&gt;people in question- government agents, etcetera- are generally a bit different
&gt;than the gang members who so regularly ignore prison sentences and the death
&gt;penalty.) Third, and getting away from the self-defense argument, it is
&gt;justice. The job of a government, if it has one, is to defend individual
&gt;liberties. It is given privileges in order to enforce that. The abuse of such
&gt;privileges should be met by death. (Yes, I would be in favor of changing
&gt;current laws to remove sovereign immunity and institute a death penalty for
&gt;governmental rights violations. Unfortunately, among the people subject to 
such
&gt;a law are the ones making the laws.)

Thank you for such a well-written defense of my philosophy.

Clearly, the government is now out of effective control of the citizenry; it 
is hard for me to understand how anybody could fail to see this.  The system 
I describe, while it may appear to some to be extreme, is a sincere attempt 
to return control to the populace.


&gt;------------------------
&gt;
&gt;&gt;How many people have to decide that another should be killed for it to be
&gt;ethical? In short, how many people does it take to decide it is a legitimate
&gt;act to take your own life?
&gt;----------------------
&gt;	Why should "how many people" make a difference? If I violate someone's
&gt;rights enough to justify such a course of action, then I should be dead 
even if
&gt;everyone except the victim is cheering. Yes, I realize that Jim Bell's system
&gt;does depend on a group of people. But so, in the end, do all such systems-
&gt;whether they call themselves governments or anarcho-capitalist societies. If
&gt;the Christian Coalition got too many people with guns in the latter, they'd
&gt;rule.
&gt;	Any further discussion would appear to belong in private email; I
&gt;suspect that Jim Bell would appreciate a cc.
&gt;	-Allen


Yes, please.  Frankly, Allen, it's a pleasure to see people really 
UNDERSTAND what I'm talking about!  You obviously do, better than mos
t.
