A few months back, some winos took most of Minnesota off the net
for a couple days. Upset with being kicked out from under a bridge,
they started a fire that took out the main fiber cable from 
downtown to MRNet + the U of M. Backup? Due to a mistake at a CO,
the backup link was routed thru the same area, and was also burned.
Interesting scrambling as nameservers puked and died.

&gt; Interesting. My ISP was shut down for a day this week because of a
&gt; "problem with a router upstream from us". &lt;insert emoticon here&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; It would be nice to see ISPs maintain multiple paths or at least have
&gt; a set of backup connections to keep outages like this from happening.

&gt; &gt; As a matter of interest, I wonder how much of the internet could be
&gt; &gt; shut down by concerted effort; obviously individual services can be
&gt; &gt; trivially disabled by jamming listen queues (not really stoppable by
&gt; &gt; anything short of IPSEC w/photuris). The BGP backbone could probably be
&gt; &gt; disabled from within by a traitor planted in one of big companies, and a
&gt; &gt; confused backhoe around the MAEs could probably do a lot more damage than
&gt; &gt; people would like to admit. It seems that the internet is getting pretty
&gt; &gt; brittle- I wonder if it would be worthwhile having some sort of infranet
&gt; &gt; with a bunch of backups links using dial-up lines or spare transponders
&gt; &gt; (with a filter to block port 80 :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's probably not possible with  todays routing technology
&gt; &gt; (slow, flappy links with nightmarish convergence times), plus it's not
&gt; &gt; sexy like a nice OC-12 SONET. This is the sort of thing the NCSC should
&gt; &gt; be working on- something to keep the essential services flowing in the
&gt; &gt; early stages of an info-war, or an info truck-bomb
