&gt;&gt;Tell me whats wrong with this section of the telecom bill.  I have a six
&gt;&gt;year old boy I am trying to raise
&gt;&gt;and it is hard enough to teach him respect and values without explaining why
&gt;&gt;Ned Beatty is being
&gt;&gt;bungholed in the woods by Billy Bob or why the Terminator splattered this
&gt;&gt;guys brains all over the
&gt;&gt;wall.  
&gt;&gt;        Tell me why parents should not be able to censor their OWN
&gt;&gt;television so that they may raise their children the way THEY see
&gt;&gt;fit...................Did your dad give you his old
&gt;&gt;playboys?.........NOOOOO............
&gt;&gt;Did he take you down to your grandmothers autopsy before her
&gt;&gt;funeral?...................I Don't Think So.....
&gt;
&gt;Agreed. And the government didn't have to force him.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;        Honestly, don't you believe that what a child is exposed to effects
&gt;&gt;his judgement, perception,
&gt;&gt; attitude,and character??
&gt;
&gt;Yes.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;All I'm saying is it's tough to raise a child these days without the added
&gt;&gt;distortion of modern 
&gt;&gt;programing and parents need not be denied any tool that can help them
&gt;&gt;achieve success.
&gt;
&gt;Agreed, the question is, should the "V." chip be forced in, by government,
&gt;or should free-market demand, like your very eloquent demand above, be the
&gt;engine. I choose the free market. I might think differently about child-
&gt;rearing than you. I may want my kid to see violence or sex, or I may just
&gt;not want him/her to see both together. I may want him/her to see the truth
&gt;about history and hemp, and you may not. That's the point of a free society,
&gt;I don't get to affect your kid's upbringing, and you don't effect mine. The
&gt;problems come in when something is forced instead of being allowed to develop
&gt;naturally in the marketplace ecosystem. In the ecosystem, there would be 
&gt;multiple systems and multiple standards of what is "indecent." Filtering
&gt;services would flourish, without taxing me. In a coercive government system,
&gt;I am forced to buy a TV whith a goddam chip I will never use (no kid) and
&gt;there is one standard, and I get taxed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;                (3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of
&gt;&gt;              television each week and some children are exposed to as much 
&gt;&gt;              as 11 hours of television a day.
&gt;
&gt;My parents limited me to 1hr / day, after homework, I chose what to view.
&gt;[But I turned into a guy who is a cypherpunk, likes nice blowjobs, reads
&gt;Playboy, smokes cigars, etc., so what did they know? &lt;g&gt;

Nuff said, point taken. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;                (6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the
&gt;&gt;              pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on
&gt;&gt;              television, eroding the ability of parents to develop
&gt;&gt;              responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.
&gt;
&gt;So get rid of your TV altogether! [Some really do, with excellent results.]

Agreed.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;                (7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual
&gt;&gt;              video programming and strongly support technology that would
&gt;&gt;              give them greater control to block video programming in the 
&gt;&gt;              home that they consider harmful to their children.
&gt;
&gt;So obviously, the free-marketplace won't work here.

Your right again.

&gt;&gt;                (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering
&gt;&gt;              parents to limit the negative influences of video programming
&gt;&gt;              that is harmful to children.
&gt;
&gt;There is compelling individual interest in being left alone and taxed less.

And again.

&gt;&gt;                (9) Providing parents with timely information about the 
&gt;&gt;              nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological
&gt;&gt;              tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other
&gt;&gt;              programming that they believe harmful to their children is a
&gt;&gt;              nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that
&gt;&gt;              compelling governmental interest.
&gt;
&gt;And the marketplace will never do _that_!

Alright,  Alright already, I can admit
defeat..................................Which is more than I can say for
most of us.

&gt;[Sorry I must be as sarcastic as I am, it's a symptom of Libertarianism;)]
&gt;
&gt;PS -- Much better .sig.
THANX
&gt;Sighpsi.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your point of veiw.

||The government  is my shepherd I need not work. It alloweth me to lie
 down on a good job. It leadeth me beside stilled factories. It destroyeth
 my initiative. It leadeth me in the path of a parasite for politics sake. YEA,
 though I walk through the valley of laziness and deficet spending I shall
 fear no evil, for the government is with me. It prepareth an economic utopia
 for me by appropriating the earnings of my grandchildren. It filleth my head
 with false security. My inefficiency runeth over. Surely, the government 
should care for me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in a fools paradise
forever.................AMEN!   || nuke'm if ya got'em||
