   VICE PRESIDENT UNVEILS NEWEST ON-LINE SERVICE FOR U.S. BUSINESSES
  Gore Says U.S. Business Advisor Key To Governing In Information Age


    Vice President Gore today (2/13) unveiled the a new and improved
"customer-designed" version of the U.S. Business Advisor.  The
"Advisor", which was first presented at the 1995 White House
Conference on Small Business, underwent a six-month redesign that
addressed the specific needs of the business community.  The improved
"Advisor" will provide users with one-stop electronic access to more
than 60 different federal organizations that assist or regulate
businesses.

	This on-line service, which directly links American businesses
with the federal government, was originally developed by the Vice
President's National Performance Review in cooperation with federal
agencies and the business community.

	Today, at the annual convention of the Armed Forces
Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) in Tyson's Corner,
VA, the Vice President officially placed the new Advisor on the World
Wide Web (<A  HREF="http://www.business.gov">http://www.business.gov</A>).

	"By employing state-of-the-art information technology, the
Advisor is improving communication between American businesses and
their government," the Vice President said.  "Because this version was
developed with the support of the business community, the Advisor
serves our customers on their terms.  Both Fortune 500 companies and
start-up businesses will benefit from this improved service."

	The Advisor provides an interactive environment where
businesses can:  file documents electronically with the government;
retrieve documents, applications and other information; get answers to
commonly asked questions; obtain names and contact numbers of business
agencies; acquire news on specific business topics; and send feedback.

	The improved version of the U.S. Business Advisor was unveiled
today as the Vice President delivered the second of three speeches on
technology and the future of America.  The "Technology Trilogy" began
Monday (2/12), in Baltimore, MD, where the Vice President spoke to the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.  The final speech
is scheduled for tomorrow (2/14), in Philadelphia, PA, where the Vice
President will visit the first programmable computer, also known as the
ENIAC.
