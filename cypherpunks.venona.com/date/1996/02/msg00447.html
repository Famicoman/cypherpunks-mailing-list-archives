&gt;I think the first problem would be how to hide a sites true location.  &gt;For example, if I have a domain called xxx.offensivestuff.org, how would

&gt;looking for it, yet not allow a goverment agency to home in on the
&gt;geographical locations via trace route.

That's a problem... data havens come to mind, but that's another issue.
Keeping the data in a domain/country where it is not restricted, or where
laws are very laxly enforced is one start... then the issue is using
crypto so that one can get the material from a country that restricts
it.

[Off topic... DC Nets/Anonymous or encrypted IRC comes to mind too...]

&gt;Of course, this approch would result in a slower connection and more &gt;packet hops.

A price for maintaining security and anonyimity...

&gt;
&gt;I like this idea, but I am not sure how the laws work.  For example if a &gt;BBS had subscribers sign a voucher stating that they were not agent of a
&gt;goverment agency, would it hold up? would lying constitue entapment?

It wouldn't work, and would make them more interested in the material
that BBS has.  Any what about DMV/DOT employees, clerks, firemen, 
hospital employees, etc., who are non-enforcement people?

Encryption would restrict wiretapping.  If users send private encrypted
email to each other (Isn't there a PBBS program that allows users to
PGP-encrypt private mail to each other...?) that's another layer of
security.  Keeping the BBS on an encrypted partition also helps.

BBS's aren't as prone to snooping as networks are, but then again, why
should government employees be the only type of snooper?

The comm program could also implement a kind of zero-knowledge proof
or digital sig rather than the standard login, making the BBS secure
against someone hacking an account.

Just some suggestions to dilute the noise ratio...
