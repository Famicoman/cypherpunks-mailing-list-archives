&gt;
&gt;I'm a bit suprised this hasn't turned up yet on Cypherpunks.  A couple
&gt;of forwarded messages: first, an announcement made Fri Feb 16 by Gene
&gt;Spafford at COAST about an exploitable flaw they've found in Kerberos,
&gt;and then a comment on the www-security list that it is due to a bad
&gt;random number generator. Same old story!
&gt;
&gt;The message (lifted from the COAST web site)
&gt;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
&gt;
&gt;Personnel at the COAST Laboratory (Computer Operations, Audit, and
&gt;Security Technology) at Purdue University have discovered a
&gt;vulnerability in current versions of the Kerberos security system.
&gt;Graduate students Steve Lodin and Bryn Dole, working with Professor
&gt;Eugene Spafford, have discovered a method whereby someone without
&gt;privileged access to most implementations of a Kerberos 4 server can
&gt;nonetheless break secret session keys issued to users.  This means that
&gt;it is possible to gain unauthorized access to distributed services
&gt;available to a user without knowing that user's password. This method
&gt;has been demonstrated to work in under 1 minute, on average, using a
&gt;typical workstation, and sometimes as quickly as 1/5 second.
&gt;
&gt;The Kerberos system was developed at MIT in the mid-1980s, and has
&gt;been widely adopted for security in distributed systems worldwide.
&gt;Kerberos is most often used on UNIX platforms by various vendors, and
&gt;is often enhanced, sold and supported by 3rd-party vendors for use in
&gt;academic, government, and commercial environments.
&gt;
&gt;The same researchers at COAST have also found a small, theoretical
&gt;weakness in Kerberos version 5 that would allow similar access, given
&gt;some additional information and considerable preliminary computation.
&gt;Kerberos version 5 does not exhibit the same weakness as described
&gt;above for Kerberos version 4.
&gt;
&gt;The researchers at COAST had intended to release the specific details
&gt;of the problem to affected vendors and incident response teams during
&gt;the week of February 19, prior to making a public announcement of
&gt;their findings.  However, as rumors have begun to circulate and
&gt;several representatives of the news media have apparently received
&gt;indication of the problem, we are releasing this preliminary
&gt;announcement at this time.
&gt;
&gt;Government and industry sponsors of the COAST Laboratory were made
&gt;aware of the preliminary details of these findings in January (full
&gt;sponsors receive early notification of significant discoveries as a
&gt;result of COAST research).  Other affiliates of COAST as well as the
&gt;world-wide network of FIRST computer incident response teams were made
&gt;aware of the general nature of the findings during the week of
&gt;February 5.  The original plan at COAST was to release specific
&gt;details only to FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams)
&gt;teams and to MIT prior to announcement by affected vendors of a fix
&gt;for these weaknesses.  The flaw in Kerberos version 4 is significant
&gt;enough that disclosure of its details prior to a fix would allow
&gt;someone with moderate programming skills to exploit it; there is
&gt;currently no reason to believe that others know the details of the
&gt;flaw and are exploiting it, so there is no immediate danger to the
&gt;public that would warrant release of the details at this time.
&gt;
&gt;COAST personnel have been informed that MIT has already developed a
&gt;fix for the flaw in version 4 Kerberos and is preparing it for
&gt;release.  Additionally, COAST researchers are cooperating with MIT
&gt;personnel to identify what (if any) fixes are necessary for version 5
&gt;Kerberos. Users of either version of Kerberos should contact their
&gt;vendors for details of any fixes that may be made available; vendors
&gt;of products incorporating Kerberos should contact MIT directly for
&gt;details of the problems and fixes.
&gt;
&gt;COAST is a research group of faculty and students dedicated to
&gt;research into information security and computer crime investigation,
&gt;and education in computer and network security.  It is the largest
&gt;such university-based group in the United States.

&gt;
&gt;There will be a fix distributed by MIT later this week. The problem is that
&gt;the random number generator in V4 is worse then we thought! The fix is to
&gt;retrofit the V5 generator (which is decent) into the V4 KDC. Note: Only the
&gt;KDC needs to be updated, clients and servers are unaffected.
