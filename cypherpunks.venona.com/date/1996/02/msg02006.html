&gt;&gt; Might want to be careful calling Marianne a borderline liar. She's our host

&gt;&gt; also been coming to Cypherpunks meetings since the beginning, and posts

&gt;
&gt;I apologize for the remark, it was out of line.  I don't know who she is,
&gt;or what she actually said, for that matter.
&gt;
&gt;But the fact remains that these sorts of security problems were predicted
&gt;well before Java was widely deployed.  They're serious, and this isn't
&gt;going to be the last one.  An awful lot of people aren't going to patch
&gt;their copies of Netscape any time soon, either.

I agree these problems will continue to show up from time to time.  With a
large security kernel, you will have security bugs.  However, if the fixes
come out in a week, then the hacking potental is greatly reduced.

&gt;(A useful feature for Netscape might be a facility that checks
&gt;periodically to see if a security patch is in order, and displays a
&gt;warning if it is.)

A very good idea.  An advantage for web based products.

&gt;Problems with security are a fact of life.  I've made embarassing mistakes
&gt;that compromised security for some of my users.  When that happens you
&gt;have to come clean, tell the truth, and fix the problem.  Don't try to
&gt;convince people that you didn't screw up, that the problem isn't serious. 
&gt;Don't say things that will encourage users to put off installing a
&gt;security patch.  And don't underestimate the ability of your attackers.

This is all true.  However, from what I know, in this case you would need
to know the details of the flaw, and be able to generate a java bytecode
stream which takes advantage of the problem.  If the fixes come out
quickly, then your attackers don't have much time.  However if they
discover the flaw before you do you are in deep shit.
