&gt; Web900 -  The easiest way to charge users to access your web site!
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Dear WebMaster,
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to use this bandwidth to introduce you to a new service
&gt; called Web900. Simply put, Web900 is the easiest way to charge your
&gt; users for products, services, or accessing areas on your web site. The
&gt; net is finally becoming a place where all of us can make money and
&gt; Web900 is the easiest, most secure way that we've seen to collect that
&gt; money from people surfing the net.
&gt;
&gt; We'd also like to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about
&gt; our company. Logicom has been in the online industry since 1987. We
&gt; were one of the first developers for a BBS package called The Major BBS
&gt; (now called Worldgroup) by Galacticomm, Inc. Since then, we've grown
&gt; into a successful developer and Galacticomm's largest reseller.
&gt;
&gt; In 1994, we entered into the 900 access code business with a service
&gt; called "Quick Credit 900." Quick Credit 900 works strictly with The
&gt; Major BBS and Worldgroup systems by Galacticomm and it quickly grew
&gt; into one of the largest 900 billing services available for the online
&gt; industry. At the end of 1995, we bought out T.A.B.S. 900 in order to
&gt; expand our market beyond just Galacticomm systems. T.A.B.S. covers
&gt; other BBS packages such as Wildcat!, PCBoard, Searchlight, Mindwire and
&gt; TBBS. This buyout made us the largest 900 billing service for the
&gt; online industry.
&gt;
&gt; The next logical progression was to add Web900. Web900 enables Logicom
&gt; to completely blanket the entire online industry with an easy to use
&gt; 900 billing service. Our first few Web900 customers have been
&gt; resoundingly successful. Contrary to popular belief, people really are
&gt; spending money on the net! We have hundreds of clients using Quick
&gt; Credit 900 and T.A.B.S. already and hopefully you'll be one of our new
&gt; Web900 clients and help us grow Web900 into the success that our other
&gt; 900 services are enjoying, while at the same time increasing real
&gt; commerce on the web.
&gt;
&gt; Web900 is great for E-Zines, Adult Sites, Low cost product sales,
&gt; Nonprofit organizations collecting donations, Member based information
&gt; services, and virtually any web site that wants to charge for access.
&gt; If you or any of your customers currently charge for access (or even if
&gt; you're just thinking about it), we invite you to check out the
&gt; information on Web900. Our URL is <A  HREF="http://www.logicom.com">http://www.logicom.com</A> - we do offer
&gt; services other than Web900, so feel free to surf around while you're
&gt; visiting. Once you're at our site, to get to the Web900 information,
&gt; just click on the Web900 icon found on the clickable image map.
&gt;
&gt; Here's how it works: A web surfer gets to your site and wants to access
&gt; a restricted area. You will have a form (see our web site for a sample
&gt; form) that tells them to call a 900 number with their voice phone. They
&gt; will call the 900 number, enter your Web Site's System ID (referenced
&gt; on your form), and they will be given a redemption code. Then, they
&gt; simply enter the redemption code into the form and they're all done -
&gt; they have access. They will be billed on their phone bill and you (the
&gt; webmaster) will receive a check from us (Logicom) 45 days after the end
&gt; of the billing period for all codes obtained during that billing period.
&gt;
&gt; You'll find that Web900 is better than Cybercash, DigiCash, First
&gt; Virtual or any other electronic cash method because it's so easy to
&gt; use. Your customers don't have to fill out some sort of application ...
&gt; they don't have to deal with "wallets", "VirtualPINs", or "ecash" ...
&gt; they don't have to give ANYONE their credit card number or checking
&gt; account number ... and they don't have to figure out what the heck
&gt; "electronic cash" is. All this means that you don't have to sell them
&gt; on any new payment concepts - everyone pays their phone bill with real
&gt; money right now. They don't have to change their spending habits in any
&gt; way.
&gt;
&gt; It's also important to mention that Web900 is totally secure. Web
&gt; surfers don't have to give anyone their credit card number at any time.
&gt; In fact, they don't even need to have a credit card number. The
&gt; redemption code that they get from Web900 is only good on your system
&gt; and it's only good for one use. You, the Webmaster, will be downloading
&gt; a set of codes via a secure modem connection (not over the internet)
&gt; for redemption purposes. There's no need for encryption to be used -
&gt; everything can be done "in the clear" without any security concerns.
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, Web900 costs you absolutely nothing to setup, so you really
&gt; have nothing to lose. (There is a 20% fee taken out of each call to pay
&gt; the phone company and our administration fees.) In closing, we'd like
&gt; to ask you to please look at the information on Web900 located at
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.logicom.com">http://www.logicom.com</A> and compare them to the other options (URLs are
&gt; located at the bottom of this letter). If you have any questions,
&gt; please feel free to e-mail us at web900@logicom.com or give us a call
&gt; at (800) 764-4266 (international callers please use (954) 726-3868).
&gt; Thank you for the time you've taken to read this letter, we hope you've
&gt; find this knowledge useful.
