<PRE>

Thank you very much for your suggestion. I do not know if you have 
noticed or not,  but we have already done that, with the exception of 
private mail to a very few unspecified individuals, and this letter alone 
among all of the dozens of C'punk and other letters, we have suspended 
replying to the attacks. Please also note, that other than to four 
selected cypher lists, generic, we have made no postings to usenet, or 
listserve groups. We are eager for your cooperation, but there are problems
with complying to some of your requests. Give us a chance to explain that to a 
few of your people, and we will get back with you. Also, please read my 
revised response below,

I believe that the first priority is establish the strength, or lack 
thereof, of the algorithms, Everything else is irrelevant unless that 
can be established one way or the other. Accordingly, I am taking 
the necessary to initiate that effort. Please be patient, for a few days.


Appreciatively yours,


Ralph,   

That applies to even you Perry - the appreciative part that is

&gt; Suggestion: wait a week until the flames on the c'punks list die

&gt; of those issues. Much easier to deal with than attacks from several 
&gt; dozen directions all of the time.
&gt; 

The following has been revised:





&gt; &gt; Your point is well 
&gt; &gt; taken and greatly appreciated; I made a hasty reply to Derek - in 
&gt; &gt; making that hasty reply, I made a serious error; however, in fact, 
&gt; &gt; what I said has nothing to do with the facts. Derek's reply 
&gt; &gt; concerned me, I was afraid that I had gone too far.
&gt; &gt; At the time that  I composed that, I was trying to be vague 
&gt; &gt; in a deliberate act of obscrurantism; because Derek, alone among you 
&gt; &gt; seem to understand what was going on, and was very, very close to home - 
&gt; &gt; I acted rashly and made a stupid bluder -  I can do 
&gt; &gt; nothing about that except to apologize, admit it freely and take my
&gt; &gt; medicine from Perry and the others - 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can assure you that the quoted three 
&gt; &gt; lines are not a part of the algorithms, and have never been. I 
&gt; &gt; hope that you will forgive me for such a stupid blunder. I hope that 
&gt; &gt; such stupidity on my part does not close your mind to even looking at 
&gt; &gt; the actual algorithms - the question is to do justice for 
&gt; &gt; you and for me. I was only trying to decide what to do about 
&gt; &gt; releasing the algorithms, and how I could go about douing that as a 
&gt; &gt; result of some highly unusual problems in doing that. 
&gt; &gt; vague,  and trying to decide to what to do about releasing the algorithms - 
&gt; &gt; and some extremely difficult problems related to that -
