Subject: IEEE Symposium Program Announcement

I'm distributing a copy of this year's program to members of these
security-oriented WG mailing lists as a means of "getting the word out" to
individuals who may be interested in attending this sort of conference.  As
the chair of the former PEM WG, and current co-chair of the PKI WG, I feel
that this announcement is appropriate for these lists, and I hope my fellow
IPSEC WG members agree that it is appropriate for that list as well.  I
apologize in advance for those of you who, like me, will receive multiple
copies of this announcement.

Five-Minute Research Talks Session
==================================
At the 1995 Symposium a session of five-minute research talks was held for the
first time.  These proved very popular, so there will be another session this
year.  It is being held on Monday to give attendees more opportunities to
contact the presenters during the rest of the conference.  If you are interested
in presenting a five-minute talk, please submit a one-page abstract in ASCII
format by email to mchugh@cs.pdx.edu no later than 2 April 1996.  See
<A  HREF="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/SP96/">http://www.cs.pdx.edu/SP96/</A> for more information.  Abstracts to be distributed
at the conference.  Please note that the five-minute time limit will be strictly
enforced.


Evening Sessions
================
The 1996 IEEE Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy will accommodate
poster sessions and evening discussions.  There will be rooms with blackboards
and bulletin boards for interested parties to post presentations on work in
progress, recent research results, and innovative proposals, or to lead
discussions on topics of current interest.  These rooms will be available Monday
and Tuesday, May 6 and 7, from 8 p.m. to midnight.  If you are interested in
posting a presentation or organizing a discussion on a particular topic, please
indicate so on the registration form.
