If you're so concerned about secrecy and patents, why encourage anyone
to reverse engineer it?  If it's as secure as you say (and it's not)
and yet unpatented, then you sure as hell don't want anyone reverse
engineering it... you don't even want to publish the compiled binary
either (if that were true).

You mean like Enigma machines? (chuckle)

&gt; Thus we can eliminate the need to have the length of the OTP to be equal

erased from the cosmos after decryption and never seen again. Anything
else just isn't a one time pad.

Gee. It sure looks random. Must be secure. [Sarcarm mode off]

&gt; Someone, will decompile it and discover that it is truly random, at least
&gt; from the practical usage basis. But we need that time to file patents,
&gt; cvopyrights and the like.

Truly random? If it's based on an algorithm and not an unpredictable
source of external randomness, it just ain't random.

If it's fed the same seed, will it produce the same output? If so,
'taint random. Don't call it that. Just don't.

Interesting that you quote Plato, who believed in such fairy tales
as essential orbs of "truth", "beauty", etc. floating around in
some neuminal hyperspace.  Faith was rather important, and the western
religions were really damn peachy about it.

Oh, I get it... OTP stands for Onto-Theological Platonism. Philisophical 
snake oil...
