&gt;	   CRE Transforms,
&gt;          trademark IPG, are the only acknowledged unbreakable method
&gt;          of so transforming digitized information. There are no
&gt;          passwords, encryption keys, or anything like that to conjure
&gt;          up, remember, and perhaps forget. 

Neat trick, unless they're using biometrics, which doesn't appear to be the
case :}

I think they just said it best themselves, but I'll comment a bit more....

[...]
&gt;          Every informed expert of the
&gt;          technology will confirm, without reservation, that the IPG
&gt;          system is not breakable, as many already have!  

All under NDA, I suppose. Note that they don't even name an "informed expert of
the technology"; at least the POTP people gave some names.

[...]
&gt;          A fully
&gt;          operational integrated multi-user system costs approximately
&gt;          $140.00 per user, ready to load and go, with thousands, or
&gt;          millions of Nvelopes and Nvelopeners. IPG also offers full
&gt;          turnkey leases at $15.00 per user, per network, per
&gt;          month, which includes all software, upgrades, administration,
&gt;          and unlimited Nvelopes and Nvelopeners.
&gt;
&gt;          As a reference to its unbreakability, we refer you to an
&gt;          article by Paul Leyland on Internet at:
&gt; 
&gt;              <A  HREF="http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/otp.html">http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/otp.html</A>

Clearly they (claim to) offer some sort of system using One Time Pads.
Notice the price quote of "$15.00 per user, per network, per month" including
"unlimited Nvelopes and Nvelopeners". I suspect this means that they're
basically selling chunks of (pseudo- ?)random data for as much as $15/person 
each month !  I guess it's nice work if you can get it. At that price, one
would hope that they're at least generating truly random bits from a hardware
source. But their skimpy details on their proprietary processes don't
inspire confidence....

&gt;          For more information visit our Web Site at:
&gt; 
&gt;              <A  HREF="http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg">http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg</A>

In case you didn't get enough hyperbole from the press release, they have
extra helpings on the Web. This site has numerous pages containing precious
little real information. I found a few tidbits in unlikely places, though:

In <A  HREF="http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg/mlmplan.html">http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg/mlmplan.html</A>, which incidentally promises
that they "can help you to make some big bucks through the PCX Nvelopes
Multi - Level - Marketing Plan", it says:

&gt; With our manufacturing process it is relatively easy for us
&gt; to manufacture a ready to go system, for 25 users, or for
&gt; 2,500 users.  All the user has to do is to prepare a
&gt; DIR.LST, a Directory Listing of the users. We use that as
&gt; the template and manufacture the system. 

This is actually a little scary. According to one of their other web pages, 
the DIR.LST file is a numbered list of user names and email addresses. So it
appears that a customer hands over a list of names and addresses, and IPG
assigns a set of one-time pads (or something) to each pair of users on the 
list. (Holy combinatorial explosion.) And now IPG knows the one-time pads that
will be used between any pair of email addresses on the list it has !  
The EES is starting to look attractive by comparison. 

&gt; It becomes a load
&gt; and go installation at each of the user sites. 

Gee, why are we all so worried about key management ?  It's just a load and
go installation at each of the user sites !  ;)

&gt; We will even prepare, or help prepare, the DIR.LST for users.
&gt;
&gt; While we have the software and manufacturing facility to do
&gt; that quickly, it is not easily transportable, to say the
&gt; least, and certain aspects of it, we consider highly proprietary.

"not easily transportable, to say the least" ???  
Any ideas to what this might refer ?

OK, I saved (IMHO) the best for last. I suppose this could be taken as a claim
about their proprietary, immobile RNG methods:
(from <A  HREF="http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg/comp.html">http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg/comp.html</A>)

&gt;         How do we Achieve such High Standards?
&gt;                  First Class Quality Control!
&gt;
&gt; We achieve unusually high standards of excellence because
&gt; of the manufacturing process. Over 30%, sometimes as high as 
&gt; 50% or more of our Nvelopes, Nvelopeners, are discarded 
&gt; because they cannot meet our rigid standards. Also our 
&gt; Nvelopes and Nvelopeners are subjected to a battery of 
&gt; performance tests to insure that when used, they will meet the 
&gt; high standards that you would expect.

&lt;sigh&gt; It's a jungle out there....
