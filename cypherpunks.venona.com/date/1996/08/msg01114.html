I would be happy to distribute it from my site, along side Mixmaster.

&gt;
&gt;The first alpha release of the WinSock Remailer is now available via
&gt;e-mail.  Due to problems setting up user authentication on my homepage
&gt;at
&gt;
&gt;  <A  HREF="http://www.c2.net/~winsock/">http://www.c2.net/~winsock/</A>
&gt;
&gt;I have decided to distribute it via e-mail until I can get user
&gt;authentication working.
&gt;
&gt;In order for you to receive the WinSock Remailer, I have to be reasonably
&gt;sure that you are a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
&gt;Therefore, you will need to review a copy of the License Agreement and
&gt;fill out the required information.  Then clear-sign the agreement with PGP
&gt;and mail it to me at jgrasty@gate.net.  Don't forget to tell me where I can
&gt;find your PGP public key so that I can check the signature.  No signed
&gt;license agreement, no remailer.
&gt;
&gt;In order for me to have a good feeling that you are not a foreign national,
&gt;I need to have the following information check out:
&gt;
&gt;a.  Verify that your address is within the boundaries of the US or Canada.
&gt;    I will do this by checking if you are in a public address database such
&gt;    as "88 Million Households Phone Book".
&gt;b.  Verify that your name and e-mail address is the same as in your public
&gt;    key.
&gt;
&gt;This is basically the same method that Netscape is using at:
&gt;
&gt;  <A  HREF="http://wwwus.netscape.com/eng/US-Current/">http://wwwus.netscape.com/eng/US-Current/</A>
&gt;
&gt;to verify citizenship or permanent residency, but the process is not
&gt;automated.
&gt;
&gt;I don't like having to enforce clearly unconstitutional ITAR regulations,
&gt;but I'm not ready for an extended stay at Club Fed.

&gt;the Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you are
&gt;representing and warranting that you are not located in, under control
&gt;of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.
&gt;
&gt;8. JOEY GRASTY OR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR (a) INCIDENTAL,
&gt;CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY SORT, WHETHER ARISING IN
&gt;TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF JOEY GRASTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE

&gt;INJURY TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. FURTHERMORE,
&gt;SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
&gt;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO

&gt;as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or

&gt;disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk
&gt;Activities.
