&gt; [ To: sci.crypt ## Date: 08/24/96 03:11 am ##
&gt;   Subject: IDEA and Timing Attacks ]
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still kind-of recovering from this year's Crypto conference, but
&gt; I told several people I would post this.  At the rump session this
&gt; year, I presented an arguably practical timing attack on many
&gt; implementations of IDEA.  There are actually two attacks available,
&gt; but one requires extremely fine timing results.  After I gave the
&gt; presentation, Willi Meier told me he had independently found the
&gt; same results, and had implemented the full attack (which I hadn't
&gt; yet done).
&gt; 
&gt; There are two different attacks.  The most practical is an
&gt; adaptive chosen-plaintext attack, which requires about 5*n*2^{16}
&gt; chosen plaintexts (read ``five n times two to the sixteenth''),
&gt; where the parameter n depends on the precision of timings available
&gt; and the timing variability of the implementation.  The second attack
&gt; is ciphertext-only, but requires timing measurements precise enough
&gt; to detect the difference between a single multiply of a zero vs.
&gt; nonzero value.  It requires about 5*n*2^{16} values, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The basic idea behind the attack is as follows:  in many
&gt; implementations, a zero input into the multiply operation is handled
&gt; by an if statement, and so does not cause a multiply instruction to
&gt; actually be executed.  The result on a 486 is that it is
&gt; significantly faster to multiply by a zero rather than a nonzero
&gt; value.  This timing difference gives us a really nice way to learn
&gt; information about the internal values of the cipher.
&gt; 
&gt; This presentation is necessarily not very good, since I can't embed
&gt; a diagram here.  If you have a copy of _Applied Cryptography_, then
&gt; turn to the section on IDEA (page 321 in the hardback version of the
&gt; second edition).  The diagram shows one round of IDEA, and then
&gt; (after the ellipses) the output transformation.
&gt; 
&gt; The chosen plaintext attack works as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.   Build a run of n*2^{16} chosen plaintexts, by choosing a
&gt; single value for X_1, and choosing n of each possible value for X_3,
&gt; with X_2 and X_4 taking on values at random.  Time the encryption of
&gt; each batch of n plaintexts with the same X_3 value.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.   Choose a new value for X_1, and then build another run of
&gt; chosen plaintexts exactly as above.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.   For each of these two runs, if the value of Z_5 is not zero,
&gt; there should be a different value for X_3 that gives the lowest
&gt; encryption time.  (These are the values that force the input to the
&gt; multiply with Z_5 to be zero.)  Call these X_3 and X_3'.  This gives
&gt; us two equations in two unknowns, and we can solve for it with a
&gt; 32-bit brute-force search.  (There may be faster ways, as well.)
&gt; 
&gt;      (X_1 (*) Z_1) = (X_3 + Z_3)
&gt;      (X_1'(*) Z_1) = (X_3'+ Z_3)
&gt; 
&gt; We now have recovered Z_1 and Z_3.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.   Let's call the input to the multiply with Z_5 A.  We can use
&gt; knowledge of Z_1 and Z_3 to force A to keep the same value.  We then
&gt; choose three new runs of chosen plaintexts, each containing 2^{16}
&gt; batches of n plaintexts apiece.  Each of these ensures that A and
&gt; X_2 are kept constant, so that we wind up three difference values
&gt; for A, X_2 and X_4 which correspond to zero inputs into the multiply
&gt; with Z_6.  This means that we wind up with three equations in three
&gt; unknowns.
&gt; 
&gt;      (A  (*) Z_5) + ((Z_2 + X_2  ) XOR (Z_4 (*) X_4  )) = 0
&gt;      (A' (*) Z_5) + ((Z_2 + X_2' ) XOR (Z_4 (*) X_4' )) = 0
&gt;      (A''(*) Z_5) + ((Z_2 + X_2'') XOR (Z_4 (*) X_4'')) = 0.
&gt; 
&gt; This can be solved with a 48-bit brute force search (there are
&gt; probably faster ways).  We now have 80 bits of IDEA's key, and can
&gt; brute-force search the remaining 48 bits.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that this is actually an adaptive chosen-plaintext attack as
&gt; described.  I'm pretty sure this can be turned into a proper
&gt; chosen-plaintext attack with some work, and I'll probably be hacking
&gt; on this in the next few weeks, as time allows.
&gt; 
&gt; The ciphertext only attack is simpler in some ways.  The first 32
&gt; bits are extremely easy to recover--find the average time to encrypt
&gt; blocks with each value in their first and last 16 bits, and then
&gt; solve for the subkey values that would be necessary for those
&gt; multiplies to have zeros as their inputs.  Next, we look for a
&gt; correlation between low encryption times and the values for Z_3 in
&gt; the output transformation that would result in zero inputs into the
&gt; previous round's MA box multiply.  Finally, we attack the second
&gt; multiply in that MA box, using all four output values.  The
&gt; approximate computational difficulty is 2^{48}, as before.
&gt; 
&gt; There are other timing attacks on IDEA.  We gave one in our paper at
&gt; Crypto this year (the one on related-key cryptanalysis of several
&gt; ciphers, by Bruce Schneier, David Wagner, and me), and the
&gt; related-key timing attack is where I got the idea to try a timing
&gt; attack on the whole cipher.
&gt; 
&gt; All timing attacks are implementation-dependent to some extent.  On
&gt; a Pentium, I suspect the timing attack will be considerably harder.
&gt; (One person I discussed the attack with said he thought it would
&gt; take longer to do the conditional branch for the if statement than
&gt; to do the multiply, so we might have zero multiplies taking more
&gt; rather than less time.)
&gt; 
&gt; Most applications aren't really susceptible to timing attacks,
&gt; because of the way they're used.  In addition, chosen-plaintext
&gt; attacks on block ciphers are pretty nicely thwarted by using CBC or
&gt; CFB modes.  It is probably also possible to implement IDEA so that
&gt; it executes in constant time.  I should point out that it is *NOT*
&gt; enough either to add random delays (which fall out if you add more
&gt; samples), nor to just get rid of the big timing difference with zero
&gt; inputs (though that will make timing attacks somewhat more
&gt; difficult).  As long as internal (secret) information is being
&gt; leaked by timing, the cipher is probably vulnerable to some kind of
&gt; timing attack.
