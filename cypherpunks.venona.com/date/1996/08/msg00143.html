&gt;&gt;As long as they have a license to operate a food dispencing facility (in
&gt;&gt;other words they are certifying they are aware of the correct processes for
&gt;&gt;such operations) then nobody should have the right to interfere with their
&gt;&gt;operation unless with probable cause (ie proof of danger such as bad weenies
&gt;&gt;in their hot dogs). This would not apply to individuals or families making
&gt;&gt;such food in the same place for their own and NOT public consumption.
&gt;
&gt;I believe the issue with Food Not Bombs is they didn't get the appropriate
&gt;permits, etc, or were denied them, or something.  However, I disagree with
&gt;you on this point.  I think they shouldn't be required to obtain a license,
&gt;but everyone whom they serve food to should know that they don't have such a
&gt;license.  This would equal informed consent.  Also, with Food Not Bombs, many
&gt;of the people that the food is being served to is also involved in cooking,
&gt;distributing food, and cleaning up.  I've been told it's exactly like a big
&gt;picnic, except for anyone is invited to help and/or eat.

It was in fact "Food Not Bombs" which I was referring to in my post a few
days ago.

My point to the City Council was one of inconsistency (picnic groups not
similarly hassled). Also, the use of "permits" to harass/muzzle a group.

"Permits" are often used to stop speech and acts which are not considered
acceptable. Drawing on my own community for an example, Santa Cruz tried to
regulate palm readers, astrologers, mystics, and seers. This eventually
fell apart, possibly when the implications became clear to the bureaucrats
(the future was already clear to the Cassandras, but nobody believed them).

My "Licensed Ontologist" line in my .sig was added during one of the
debates about the claimed need to license and regulate persons in various
professions.

(There are of course the usual other examples, where job unions and cartels
stop "outsiders" from participating. Often for ostensibly good reasons, but
"guilds" nonetheless. The implications of crypto anarchy for these guilds
are left as exercises for the student.)
