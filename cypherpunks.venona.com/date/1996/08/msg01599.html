mpd@netcom.com (Mike Duvos) writes:
&gt; One of the nice things about IRC is that if the Empire State
&gt; Building suddenly blows up, you can tune to #bomb and generally
&gt; find several hundred people interested in discussing it without
&gt; having to go through some complicated newgroup/rmgroup/discussion
&gt; procedure.

Unfortunately, there's no easy way to rmgroup a usenet newsgroup once it
gets created. Many sites ignore all rmgroups. In fact, many large sites
now ignore all newgroups unless a user specifically asks to carry a new
newsgroup.

I believe the main reason why most newsadmins seem to want to have some
restrictions on newgrouping is the lack of efficient rmgrouping.

If we could newgroup misc.news.current-events.empire-state-bombing
and then have it disappear quetly and automatically once the non-spam
traffic is gone, I'm sure a lot fewer people would object to its creation.

&gt; The real data base of Usenet is the totality of messages, indexed
&gt; by message ID, and there are so many newsgroups now that allowing
&gt; the Newsgroups: line to have arbitrary contents in the message
&gt; header would do little to increase the confusion. Entering each
&gt; arbitrary entry in the Newsgroups: line into a secondary
&gt; searchable index would provide the same functionality as we have
&gt; now with the conventional arrangement of newsgroups.

Assuming that this is done, why bother with newgroup/rmgroup at all?
If you think comp.language.algol is a worthwhile newsgroup (as I do),
just put it in your header and see if anyone sees your article.
Well-named keywords in Newsgroups: will act as these Snelling(?)
points senile Tim ranted about.

&gt; With governments creating lists of "banned" newsgroups, and an
&gt; official creation process managed by the "Cabal", Usenet is much
&gt; more vulnerable to state control than it would be if newsgroups
&gt; were simply arbitrary strings which existed somewhere in the
&gt; current window into the history file.  A newsgroup would then
&gt; exist if there were messages in it, and wouldn't exist if it had
&gt; remained unused for some reasonable period of time.

The reason for Cabal's existence is twofold. First, it is a bunch
of control freaks who want to be in charge and get a kick out of
telling users "you can't do this". Second, sysadmins are willing
to put up with this shit because they think they need some means
to control newsgrouping.

&gt; Now that search engines are becoming the best way to read Usenet
&gt; anyway, and the Newsgroups: line is just another field in a set
&gt; of search specifications, there is no reasonable reason to limit
&gt; what may be placed there to some list of "20,000" pre-defined
&gt; strings, or some government controlled subset of the above.

Absolutely.

&gt; If Singapore bans alt.sex.hooters, you could simply post to
&gt; alt.culture.singapore.i.got.your.hooters.right.here. This
&gt; would effectly jerk the rug out from under the "banned
&gt; newsgroups" gestapo, and create a namespace so large you would
&gt; always be able to construct an appropriately suggestive new entry
&gt; in the compliment of any part that was blocked.

Yes.

&gt; It would also send the correct message that "newsgroups" are
&gt; simply one of many labels on an article, and are not cyberspacial
&gt; tearooms where bad people congregate and there is guilt by
&gt; association.
&gt;
&gt; The alternative to doing something reasonable like this is
&gt; probably to see mass migration from "banned newsgroups" to
&gt; off-topic groups, like Lolita pictures in rec.pets.cats, when the
&gt; inevitable crackdown comes. As long as people can post
&gt; anonymously, they will simply switch to another existing
&gt; newsgroup when the one they are posting to becomes blocked. Once
&gt; the inevitable reciprocal pissing contest between posters and
&gt; censors gets going, Usenet as we know it will likely be
&gt; destroyed.

Usenet as I knew it 1- years ago has already been destroyed.
