&gt;&gt;I fail to see why/how the initial swap of  TrustBucks(Alice) for
&gt;&gt;TrustBucks(Bob) followed by Alice returning the TrustBucks(Bob) [as
&gt;&gt;supposed payment] differs from her just paying with the TrustBucks(Alice)
&gt;&gt;in the first place [ie: He is willing to accept the TrustBucks(Alice) as
&gt;&gt;payment for the TrustBucks(Bob) that she will use to pay off her debt]. The
&gt;&gt;net result is the same - Bob has the same amount of TrustBucks(Bob) in
&gt;&gt; circulation and has an amount of TrustBucks(Alice) equal to Alice's payment
&gt;&gt; [the back and forth of the TrustBucks(Bob) is just playing "Right
&gt;&gt; Pocket/Left Pocket"].
&gt;
&gt;I admit, my analysis is probably flawed and I appreciate you challenging
&gt;me on it. But I think it's more complex than the net result of single
&gt;transactions.
&gt;
&gt;The way I figure it, if Bob could accept / not accept any variety of
&gt;TrustBucks, then he can manipulate what varieties he reports being able
&gt;to give in order to escape debts or manipulate what varieties he reports
&gt;being able to accept in order to keep debts unpaid (for interest,
&gt;foreclosure, etc.)
&gt;
&gt;    For instance, Alice is paying off her credit card, which pays Bob a
&gt;    big 17% interest. Bob would rather not let her off early. "Nope, we
&gt;    aren't accepting TrustBucks( Carol ) this week. TrustBucks( Dave )?
&gt;    Let me see.... hmm... nope, sorry ma'am."
&gt;
&gt;    For instance, Alice has just eaten at Le Cafe Bob, and is about to
&gt;    leave. Presented with the cybercheck, she "discovers" that she
&gt;    hasn't got anything Bob is willing to accept. "Sorry 'bout that,
&gt;    Bob. Ooh, hafta run! Bye bye."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So it seems to me that the simplest course is to allow payment in
&gt;exactly one variety, the payee's own. Bob can't credibly claim to not
&gt;trust himself.
&gt;
&gt;You might object that the same problem is incurred anyways in
&gt;TrustBucks. If Bob refuses to trade TrustBucks( Bob ) for TrustBucks(
&gt;Carol ), isn't it the same thing as refusing TrustBucks( Carol )?
&gt;
&gt;I think it's subtly different, though. If Bob can accept other people's
&gt;currency, he need not issue any himself. He can credibly refuse early
&gt;payment, since no TrustBucks( Bob ) even exist. If Bob can only accept
&gt;TrustBucks( Bob ), then Alice, who reports having no TrustBucks( Bob ),
&gt;can't "innocently" incur debts she finds she cannot pay.

I admit that Bob can play games by altering the list of which currencies
(other than his own and Alice's) he is willing to accept from Alice. All I
was attempting to point out was that in the simple example you stated
(Alice does not have enough TrustBucks( Bob ) to pay off a debt to Bob so
she "Buys" the amount she needs by using TrustBucks( Alice ) and then
immediately returns the TrustBucks( Bob ) as her payment), the initial
transfer of TrustBucks( Bob ) is all smoke &amp; mirrors (and a bookkeeping
trick) since he is still accepting payment in TrustBucks( Alice) not
TrustBucks( Bob ). The net result is that he is canceling some debt by
accepting the TrustBucks( Alice ) which he might later use to pay Alice for
something.
