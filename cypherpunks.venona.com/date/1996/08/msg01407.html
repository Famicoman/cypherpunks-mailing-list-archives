                Communication Security Corporation
            CS8191 Triple-DES Telephone Privacy Device

With the growing number of tools available to assist in wiretapping,
anyone using a telephone in the '90's is vulnerable to unwanted
eavesdropping. With many of today's standard technologies, anyone can
gain access to our most private of conversations. As a result, the
telecommunications industry has an increasing need for private, secure
voice communication devices. The Communication Security Corporation
has dedicated its resources to addressing this need by designing the
CS8191, our flagship product and the most secure telephone privacy
protection available.


Unsurpassed Security 
 
Truly open, encryption technology is at the heart of the CS8191
telephone security unit. With the press of a button, the CS8191 is
activated. Within seconds your conversation is kept secure from the
intrusion of any type of wiretapping.


Open-Standard Encryption  

How are you assured that your tele-security unit is really working to
protect your telecommunications? In truth, the "trust-us" proprietary
solutions used by competing products are an indication of weak privacy
protection. They "hide" from the user, the ability to verify proper
functioning of the unit.

Communication Security provides users with the best privacy protection
by incorporating leading-edge encryption technology that utilizes the
power of truly open standards. Our commitment to an open specification
allows sophisticated users the ability to "check under the hood" and
evaluate the security attributes of the system. 


Portable And Easy To Use 
 
The CS8191 has been designed to work with conventional analog
telephone systems (POTS). The unit connects between your telephone and
the wall, much like a telephone answering machine. Plug in the power,
and that's it. In "clear mode" your telephone continues to work as it
normally does. To begin an encrypted conversation, simply press the
'go secure' button and wait for the green light to come on. The system
is easy to use and compact, making it the perfect telephone security
solution for home, travel or office use.

 
Superior Performance 
 
* As a standard component, Communication Security has incorporated a
  leading-edge speech coder for clarity unsurpassed in secure telephone
  devices, to date.

* Voice clarity is virtually undisturbed whether the system is in secure
  or clear mode.   

* LED indicators on the unit let you know instantly that your call is being
  transmitted securely.   

 
Service And Support

The Communication Security Corporation provides a one year warranty for all
parts and labor. Upgrades are included in the price of the CS8191 and are
available under the terms of the warranty.
