&gt;	 FRANKFURT, Aug 28 (Reuter) - German private bank Gries &amp;  
&gt;Heissel Bankiers on Wednesday launched an Internet banking 
&gt;service -- the first comprehensive service of its kind in a 
&gt;country where online bank options are gradually taking off. 
&gt;	 The small Berlin-based bank linked up with U.S. computer  
&gt;firm Hewlett Packard Co to develop the system, which Internet 
&gt;users can access using a high-security personal code. 
&gt;	 Clients will be able to view detailed balances on their  
&gt;deposit, current and securities accounts and transact all normal 
&gt;banking business on the World Wide Web. 
&gt;	 Although online banking is a developing trend on the German  
&gt;financial services market, larger banks with far broader 
&gt;customer bases are working on more selective Internet packages. 
&gt;	 Thomas Gries, one of Gries &amp; Heissel's personally-liable  
&gt;directors, said he regarded Internet banking as a logical 
&gt;supplement to the bank's existing services. 
&gt;	 ``We have had an Internet home page since October 1995. This  
&gt;move from a pure information medium to an interactive one was a 
&gt;logical one,'' Gries said. 
&gt;	 Banking officials attending the CEBIT electronics conference  
&gt;in Hanover this week said German online banking business was 
&gt;poised to grow dramatically. 
&gt;   ``In the next six months, five to ten German banks will be on  
&gt;the Internet,'' said Stefan Schoeller, board member at Bayerische 
&gt;Vereinsbank AG unit Vereins- und West Bank. 
&gt;	 Vereinsbank plans to launch Internet services within about  
&gt;six months via its Advance Bank direct unit, pending a review of 
&gt;security options. 
&gt;	 Rival discount broker Direkt Anlage Bank, a unit of  
&gt;Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel Bank AG, on Tuesday launched 
&gt;an Internet service for its securities account holders at half 
&gt;the cost of its telephone banking service. 
&gt;	 Meanwhile market leader Deutsche Bank AG is to test  
&gt;electronic cash on the Internet this autumn in a joint 
&gt;initiative with Dutch electronic payments group Digicash NV. 
&gt;	 Vereinsbank officials at CEBIT said they planned a steady  
&gt;expansion of the bank's online options over the coming years, 
&gt;predicting 10 to 15 percent of its current account clients would 
&gt;be online by the year 2000. Around 12 million Germans would rely 
&gt;on home banking by that date, the bank predicted. 
&gt;	 At the moment, around 3.7 percent of the bank's clients, or  
&gt;45,000 individuals, handle their banking via PC alone, Stefan 
&gt;Schoeller said. 
&gt;	 Hewlett-Packard's German sales manager Michael Lindner said  
&gt;his company, which last year helped set up the world's first 
&gt;Internet bank, Security First Network Bank, had spoken to 
&gt;several other German banks about some kind of Internet venture. 
&gt;	 ``We certainly do not plan to limit our involvement to a  
&gt;small exclusive bank,'' he said. 
&gt;	 Lindner said there were about two million Internet users in  
&gt;Germany and 35 million worldwide. He admitted that the amount of 
&gt;bank business transacted on the Net -- about $200 million -- was 
&gt;``very limited'' but predicted a dramatic rise in volume. 
&gt;	 Vereinsbank's Schoeller said the cost advantage alone made  
&gt;it worthwhile for customers to go online. A normal current 
&gt;account incurred charges of 8.40 marks a month, while the same 
&gt;account online would cost just 5.40 marks, he said. 
&gt;	 All banks are stressing the security of the Internet.  
&gt;
