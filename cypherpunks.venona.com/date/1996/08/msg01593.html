&gt; &gt; &gt;    Trouble in Paradise
&gt; &gt; &gt;    by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Washington, DC, 18 August
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Indonesian democracy activists have taken their fight for freedom
&gt; &gt; &gt;    to the Net, and the government doesn't approve.
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;    After distributing email messages about riots in Jakarta last month to
&gt; &gt; &gt;    an international Indonesian-politics mailing list, Prihadi Beny
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Waluyo, a lecturer at Duta Wacana Christian University, was arrested
&gt; &gt; &gt;    and interrogated by the military. Since then, the mailing list has
&gt; &gt; &gt;    been banned from the country and Waluyo has returned to his house,
&gt; &gt; &gt;    where he remains under surveillance.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [dan lain-lain...]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Exactly which mailing list was "banned from the country"? All the
&gt; &gt; Indonesian mailing lists I'm on, including apakabar@clark.net, are
&gt; &gt; functioning normally, with no unusual complaints or interruptions.
&gt; 
&gt; Never mind the details. What's important is that this is yet another example
&gt; of net censorship, like the Berkeley administration's reading student email
&gt; and the FBI's monitoring and disrupting patriot email. 
&gt; 
&gt; It's really sad, the difference between HRW/AI and Wired. You know, Amnesty
&gt; has some outstanding policies regarding accuracy, objectivity, and
&gt; universality. That's why they're accorded such respect. Human Rights Watch,
&gt; which has only been around since the late 70's and committed a few major
&gt; faux pas in Central America, is still learning. Wired decided that it had
&gt; all the answers years ago.


Rich is frothing again. Time to killfile him again. Note he contributes
nothing of substance except a vapid anti-Wired rant that has been done
better elsewhere, like www.howtired.com. (Personally, I don't even read
Wired much anymore. To each his own.)

As for UCB and the FBI threads, Rich is talking about back
fight-censorship discussions. He seems to think that I endorse every
message I forward to a mailing list. He is incorrect. (Rather, I offer the
information to the list, as Judge Sloviter took Olsen's testimony, "for
what it's worth.")

Back to Indonesia -- my column should have said the Indonesian military is
*trying* to ban the mailing list from the country. They haven't succeeded
yet. Time will tell.

I have more information on Indonesia at <A  HREF="http://www2.eff.org/~declan/global/">http://www2.eff.org/~declan/global/</A> -- 
right now, use the www2 address since not all directories seem to be 
updating on the mirror servers properly right now.
