&gt;
&gt;I believe the answer to preserving the purity of digital commerce is to
&gt;form it in such a way so as to make regulation impossible, because in my
&gt;view the constitution no longer provides citizens with the protection or
&gt;freedom to progress.  I feel the same way about privacy.  All the
&gt;constitutional arguments in the world mean little today.  A systematic
&gt;approach which makes violations of personal rights impossible whether
&gt;constitutional or not is the answer.
&gt;.....................................................
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I, like others on the list, have often misunderstood your references to court
&gt;cases and other legal stuff as indicators that you were being pessimistic,
&gt;discouraging, and presenting obstacles to free-thinking, imaginative ideas.
&gt;
&gt;The way in which you expressed yourself left out your true inclinations on
&gt;the subjects, and it would only be someone who had read a large number of
&gt;your posts who would realize what side of the issues you are really on.
&gt;
&gt;I agree very much with what you say in the above paragraph about the
&gt;constitutional arguments [by jove, I think he's got it :&gt;)]   So many times
&gt;people (especially libertarian types) will present their protests in
&gt;reference to constitutional issues.  Yet there are some contradictions within
&gt;the Constitution, or areas which sound that way, and which are therefore too
&gt;easily misconstrued by present thinkers (judges, lawyers, etc.).
&gt;
&gt;So often the document is referred to like a magic mantra which is going to
&gt;take away the ills and boogeymen by waving it in front of their faces.  But
&gt;the document is not so well read, understood, nor respected by those in
&gt;public office.  It isn't used as a guide to move towards more self-reliance
&gt;rather than less.  I have heard from one political potentiate that his
&gt;opponent (already in office) had not ever even read it.
&gt;
&gt;You can't depend upon adherence to the Constitution to create the reality
&gt;you're after (although, like a dart-shoot, you can always try and it does,
&gt;after all, supply the basics for the established legal procedures and it's
&gt;possible to set the fear of it upon government types by setting their feet to
&gt;its fire -  if you can pay for it).
&gt;
&gt;(This gives me a sense of deja-vu:  I think you and I had a long argument
&gt;about this on the list, once.)
&gt;
