	The usual governmental rhetoric. Again, I'm not seeing achnowledgement
from anyone except maybe the ACLU that there's no evidence that such tactics
would have stopped the TWA bombing - not that they would be justified even if
it would have. Legalized drugs, etcetera would free up quite enough law
enforcement to take care of the problem.

&gt;           FBI DIRECTOR: WIRETAP PROPOSALS WON'T THREATEN LIBERTIES

&gt;   WASHINGTON (Aug 1, 1996 1:41 p.m. EDT) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh
&gt;   said today Americans are under increasing attack by terrorists and
&gt;   proposed new wiretapping authority would not greatly expand
&gt;   government's powers.
   
&gt;   "The country and the American people have been experiencing an
&gt;   increasing war against them by terrorists and terrorist-supported
&gt;   activities," Freeh told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
&gt;   Americans "are clearly under attack and we are the prime targets for
&gt;   this kind of terrorism."
   
[...]

&gt;   Freeh said the wiretap proposals do not involve "expansive powers" for
&gt;   the government and would not lead to "an avalanche of new electronic
&gt;   surveillance."
   
&gt;   A leading GOP opponent of an earlier, more sweeping anti-terrorism
&gt;   bill said today he didn't believe Congress could enact a new package
&gt;   before its recess this weekend.
   
&gt;   "I think it would be very difficult to do in light of the logistics
&gt;   and the opposition," Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., told reporters. "The
&gt;   (anti-terrorism) funding is there. No new laws are needed."
   
&gt;   Asked about Barr's comments, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, head of a
&gt;   bipartisan task force that has been negotiating with administration
&gt;   officials on the anti-terrorism proposals, said, "That's part of the
&gt;   obstacle. It's what we have to deal with. What we do has to reach the
&gt;   level of consensus."
   
&gt;   The negotiators, led by Craig and White House chief of staff Leon
&gt;   Panetta, said they hoped to have a package ready for a vote by week's
&gt;   end before Congress leaves for its August recess.
