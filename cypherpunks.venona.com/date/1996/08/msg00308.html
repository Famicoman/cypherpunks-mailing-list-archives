&gt;Such materials will be easy to defeat.  Find an indoor shooting range, 
&gt;vacuum up the powder residue that falls  in front of the shooting stalls, 
&gt;and you'll have a concentrated mixture of literally hundreds of types of 
&gt;taggants.  Add to bomb.  Laughing, at this point, is optional.

In addition to powder residue, collect all the spent shell casings you can, 
especially ones that are of the same caliber as weapons you own. In addition to 
the possibility of reloading them (and saving a bundle on ammo costs) you can 
sprinkle them around liberally in the aftermath of an encounter (assuming you 
survive) and give the crime scene people a bunch of red herrings to deal with. 
Of course, you should never touch them, (the FBI got DNA samples from stamps the 
Unabomber licked on his mailbombs, so even tiny droplets of sweat can bust you) 
and you should collect the actual brass fired and sandblast it.

Incidentally, one of the interesting traits of a shotgun is that buckshot is not 
subject to the ballistics matching techniques used on rifle and pistol bullets. 
The plastic wads (which prevent the shot from touching the barrel) do not take 
the microscopically detailed impressions from the barrel that copper or lead 
bullets do. The heat from firing always melts the plastic slightly--enough to 
defeat this.  Of course, if you leave the fired shells lying around, the primer 
and ejector marks can bite you...

&gt;     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt;
&gt;     MICRON COMMUNICATIONS, INC., ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL
&gt;     AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
&gt;
&gt;     Boise, Idaho, August 2, 1996 - Micron Communications, Inc., today
&gt;     announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRDA)
&gt;     with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop a model
&gt;     Positive Passenger Baggage Matching (PPBM) system. The objective
&gt;     of this PPBM system is to automatically recognize when baggage has
&gt;     been placed on an aircraft without an associated passenger.

Of course, this means that every time they lose your luggage, you will be 
detained for "suspected terrorist activity", and the plane your luggage was 
wrongly sent to will be evacuated while the bomb squad takes it to a remote area 
and blows it up... (the luggage, not the plane)

gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the 
world will follow our lead in the future!"

"46.  The U.S. government declares a ban on the possession, sale, 
transportation, and transfer of all non-sporting firearms. ...Consider the 
following statement:  I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist 
confiscation of firearms banned by the U.S. government."
