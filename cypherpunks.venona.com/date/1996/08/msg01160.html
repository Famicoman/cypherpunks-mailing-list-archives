At least we didn't sue every ISP
ala CoS.  Also, I don't think he was "blaming"
the Internet neccessarily... It's been published 
in books before.

Subject: Another thing the Net is being blamed for...

Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.  

FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was 
first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept 
secret for only a short time before notorious former members got 
ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea 
of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make 
it on to the Net until about 1994.

This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a 
year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the 
Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.

=====

&gt;From this morning's Rolley&amp;Wells column in the Salt Lake Tribune (without
permission):

   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
homes.
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."
