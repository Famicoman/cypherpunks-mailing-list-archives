&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not even shure I accept the legal premise of corporations.
&gt;  - Jim Choate
&gt; 
&gt;     This is NOT a drill.

Right, petty harrasment would better describe it.

&gt; This is an actual pop quiz, in which Jim Choate 
&gt; is directed to tell us about the legal premise of incorporation. Jim, do 
&gt; you know anything about what you are talking about. Looking it up is not 
&gt; allowed.

Why should I be prohibited from looking it up? You had to in order to grasp
the concept originaly? Doesn't really matter since I already have done it
with LSD Labs. The concept behind incorporation is to create a commercial
entity whereby the  persons &amp; possessions of the principles can be
protected from most legal actions against the corporation. The fictional
rights given the corporation is intended to create a framework whereby the
existing legal structure can be applied fairly to the business that the
corporation carries out. In the case of a single proprietorship such as
CyberTects it is possible for me to loose everything I own if the right
conditions arise (eg I got sued and lose) in order to pay the judgement.
It is much harder for me to loose monies and physical property being
involved in a incorporated venture.

The reason that I oppose this is the same reason that I oppose the laws that
prevent suing the government without their permission. It creates an
atmosphere of isolation that gives petty non-elected government prols the
feeling of invincibility and isolation. It's just their job, never mind they
are fucking peoples lives over. It is the reason that big companies screw up
time and time again and still manage to survive and do it to us again.

So what do I win other than a hard time?

&gt; P.S.  could you humor me on one tiny little thing?  Can we agree that 
&gt; that the word shall be spelled "sure", not "shure", on this list?  I 
&gt; don't want to trample on your artistic vision or anything like that, but 
&gt; could we just agree on this one tiny little thing

So fucking sue me for learning to read/write phoneticaly. Geesh what a petty
attitude. Do you feel better now? Is your sense of superiority restored?
If the only criticism you have is my spelling then shut the fuck up. If it
makes you feel any better I am very hyper-active and dyslexic as well. But
that is ok, there are people that love me anyway.


                                                Jim Choate
