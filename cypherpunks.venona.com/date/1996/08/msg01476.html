&gt;&gt;CNN online (<A  HREF="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</A>) is reporting a "breakin" by "hackers"
&gt;&gt;to the DOJ web site.  They don't elaborate exactly how thy did it.

Well the DOJ site still is down, but here's some details I pulled out of a
USENET newsgroup this morning (hopefully L.G. Shirley won't mind the
forward).  All in all, it sounds like a fairly childish stunt...

From: "L. G. Shirley" &lt;lgshirley@mail.worldnet.att.net&gt;

Subject: DOJ homepage hacked!!!

About 10PM last night I clicked on my bookmark for the Federal Gov't and 
then selected, by random, the Dept of Justice.


                      <A  HREF="http://justice2.usdoj.gov/">http://justice2.usdoj.gov/</A>


SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!! Someone had made a few changes, For one it is now 
called the Department of Injustice. You are immediately greeted by the 
Nazi swastika all over your screen's background.

A flag w/the symbol is apparent. George Washington's picture is captioned 
with his words, "Move my grave to a free country! This rolling is making 
me an insomniac".

Janet Reno's portrait has been replaced by Hitler's. And a flag now bears 
the Nazi symbol. She is now called Attorney General Furher.

There is plenty of nudity and the many links will take you to places you 
may never have been before. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore Toto!

I have no clues how it was done or when. My guess is someone changed all 
the links to the DOJ page to another one, the one you see when you click 
on the DOJ's homepage.

I worked today and when I came home and tried to get back to the DOJ's 
page, no luck. Must be a major overload &lt;grin&gt; of people trying to get to 
the link of women clad in, well, next to nothing and tied with rope!

I don't think the author will make any brownie points w/women. He hacked 
the homepage they have w/the DOJ on violence against women. I'm not 
condoning such action and violence is a very serious issue but whoever did 
the hack was also very serious.

He changed a Clinton speech on affirmative action and insulted blacks with 
his choice of words. There is a lot of rambling about the internet and the 
Gov't taking away our rights on it.

The author has a interesting slant on things. This should be enough of a 
warning if you're easily offended by racism, hate, foul language, porn on 
the net, and general crudeness. Don't go there.

I would like to know just how this was done, any ideas? Is it that easy to 
hack someones homepage?

I wonder how long it'll be before this homepage link is removed and can 
they find who did the evil deed? Two months on the Net and just when I 
think I'd seen it all, wow.
