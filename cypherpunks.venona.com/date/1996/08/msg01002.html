Since metal blocks the waves and stands out on the screen one could affectively
block its use by putting up a fine metal mesh on the interior of all walls 
that are exterior to the house.  The same could be said for clothing that 
looks normal but has a metal mesh liner, like say a trench coat.

&gt;	I would wonder if a jamming device (preferably area-effect with a 
&gt;slowly randomly varying swathe of area, to avoid figuring out who was carrying
&gt;it) would be possible, or some variety of shielding (i.e., emitting waves
&gt;looking similar to flesh).

&gt;&gt;      Copyright &amp;copy 1996 Nando.net

&gt;
&gt;&gt;   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Aug 12, 1996 09:47 a.m. EDT) -- The latest
&gt;&gt;   weapon against terrorism can see right through you.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   The Passive Millimeter Wave Imager can X-ray through clothing to "see"
&gt;&gt;   a concealed weapon, plastic explosives or drugs. A police officer can
&gt;&gt;   surreptitiously aim it into a crowd from as far away as 90 feet.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   The new X-ray gun is becoming a symbol for an unlikely alliance of
&gt;&gt;   civil libertarians and gun owners who fear the fight against crime and
&gt;&gt;   terrorism may be waged at the expense of personal freedoms.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   "I'm incredibly concerned," said John Henry Hingson, a past president
&gt;&gt;   of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, meeting here
&gt;&gt;   this past week. "The entire nation could become a victim of illegal
&gt;&gt;   searches and seizures and the law is powerless to protect them from
&gt;&gt;   these police abuses."
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   But in these nervous times following the the crash of TWA Fight 800
&gt;&gt;   and bombings at the Olympics, Oklahoma City and the World Trade
&gt;&gt;   Center, many Americans are now willing to trade some of their privacy
&gt;&gt;   and civil liberties for greater security.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   A poll last week by the Los Angeles Times found that a majority of
&gt;&gt;   people -- 58 percent -- said they would curtail some civil liberties
&gt;&gt;   if it would help thwart terrorism. Thirteen percent said it would
&gt;&gt;   depend on what rights were at stake. The poll didn't ask people to
&gt;&gt;   single out any rights.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   The Clinton administration has proposed increased wiretapping and
&gt;&gt;   other anti-terrorism steps, and is doling out research grants for
&gt;&gt;   cutting edge anti-crime technology that once may have been intended
&gt;&gt;   for only military use.
&gt;   
&gt;[...]
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Two models are being developed of the Passive Millimeter Wave Imager,
&gt;&gt;   a creation of Massachusetts-based Millimetrix Corp.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   The larger one, about the size of a shoebox, is mounted on a patrol
&gt;&gt;   car and pointed at the unsuspecting person. The gadget doesn't send
&gt;&gt;   out X-rays; instead, it picks up electromagnetic waves emitted by
&gt;&gt;   human flesh.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Anything that stands in the way of those waves -- like a gun -- or
&gt;&gt;   anything that emits weaker waves -- like a bag of cocaine or a plastic
&gt;&gt;   explosive -- will show up on a little screen in the patrol car.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Clothes emit no waves. Neither do walls, allowing the device to be
&gt;&gt;   used from even outside a room.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   A second model is a smaller, battery-operated version that an officer
&gt;&gt;   can operate by hand, like a radar gun.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Millimetrix hopes to field test the larger model soon at a police
&gt;&gt;   agency.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Hingson argues the device runs roughshod over bans against illegal
&gt;&gt;   searches and seizures. The law says police can stop and frisk a person
&gt;&gt;   only when an officer has a "reasonable suspicion" the person is armed
&gt;&gt;   or involved in a crime.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Millimetrix points out that while the imager can see through clothing,
&gt;&gt;   it still leaves people some privacy. The device's display screen, the
&gt;&gt;   company says, "does not reveal intimate anatomical details of the
&gt;&gt;   person."
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Chip Walker, spokesman for the National Rifle Association, noted that
&gt;&gt;   devices like the imager threaten the legal rights of people in 31
&gt;&gt;   states who are allowed to carry concealed weapons with proper
&gt;&gt;   licenses.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   "We certainly support efforts to disarm criminals, but we need to be
&gt;&gt;   careful that we're not painting with too broad a brush here," he said.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   Walker said that as troubling as terrorism is, people may be playing
&gt;&gt;   into terrorists' hands by giving up their privacy.
&gt;   
&gt;&gt;   "One of the broader issues is that if we start giving up certain civil
&gt;&gt;   liberties, that essentially means that the terrorists are starting to
&gt;&gt;   accomplish one of their goals," he said.
