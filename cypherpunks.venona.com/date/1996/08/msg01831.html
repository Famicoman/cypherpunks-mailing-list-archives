&gt; 
&gt; ! &gt; I do not believe that freedom of speech in the U.S.A. extends to actively
&gt; ! &gt; agitating for secession or the overthrow of the federal government.
&gt; ! 
&gt; ! The right to discuss revolt or secession or the overthrow of the federal
&gt; ! government, it seems to me, is given below:
&gt; ! 
&gt; ! "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
&gt; ! equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
&gt; ! Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of 
&gt; ! Happiness - That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted
&gt; ! among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the
&gt; ! Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
&gt; ! these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
&gt; ! and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such
&gt; ! Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall
&gt; ! seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  ... "
&gt; ! 
&gt; ! Now this is the Declaration of Independence, and not the Constitution, but
&gt; ! it seems to me that the right to discuss "agitating for secession or the
&gt; ! overthrow of the federal government" is protected.
&gt; 
&gt; Correct, if government is not protecting our rights as a people, we are 
&gt; responsible for forcing the government to do so, even if that means 
&gt; changing of the guard, ie, successful radicalism.
&gt; 

Might I add:

			AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION 
 
	Articles in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the 
United States of America, proposed by Congress, and ratified by the 
Legislatures of the several States, pursuant to the fifth Article of the 
original Constitution. 
 
 
 
				ARTICLE IX. 
 
	The enumeration of the Constitution, of certain rights, shall 
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 
 
 
 
				ARTICLE X. 
 
	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, 
or to the people.
