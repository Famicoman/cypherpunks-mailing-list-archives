There is a new book on privacy due out momentarily.  The publisher's
announcement follows.

Bob

The Michie Company Introduces Data Privacy Law: A Study of United
States Data Protection by  Paul M. Schwartz and Joel R. Reidenberg

Data Privacy Law: A Study of United States Data Protection is the first
book to analyze comprehensively U.S. fair information practices law as
it pertains to data protection issues in both the public and private
sectors.

Data Privacy Law was underwritten by the European Commission in
preparation for the issuance of its Directive 95/46/EC (October 24,
1995) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data.   The book
compares coherently the fair information practices of the United States
with principles common to divergent legal systems.

Data Privacy Law has important practical applications and will help
companies that employ transborder telecommunications, conduct
interjurisdictional financial transactions, or advertise across borders
to define their own data protection strategies to ensure that
expectations of fair information practices are met.  The book will
assist lawyers, government regulators and scholars to understand data
flows in both the public and private sectors.

Author Paul M. Schwartz, Professor of Law at the University of Arkansas
School of Law (Fayetteville), has been a guest professor at the
University of Nantes, a Fulbright Senior Lecturer at the Goethe
University?s Research Center for Data Protection, and a Research Fellow
of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and of the Harry Guggenheim
Foundation.  He has provided advice and testimony to governmental
bodies in the United States and Europe.
 At present, he serves as Special Advisor to a study of health care
applications of the National Information Infrastructure carried out by
the National Academy of Science's National Research Council.

Author Joel R. Reidenberg is Associate Professor of Law at Fordham
University School of Law.  He serves as chair of the Section on
Computers and Law of the Association of American Law Schools and is a
Fellow of the Cyberspace Law Institute.  Formerly, he practiced in the
Washington, D.C. office of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, where he worked with
the international telecommunications group on European
telecommunications liberalization and competition law issues, data
protection regulation, and intellectual property issues.  Professor
Reidenberg served as an advisor to the U.S. Congress Office of
Technology Assessment and has testified on information privacy before
various government bodies.

Both authors have written and lectured extensively on privacy and
information technology law.

Priced at $90.00, this book will be a welcome resource for policy
makers, legal practitioners and scholars grappling with data protection
issues.
