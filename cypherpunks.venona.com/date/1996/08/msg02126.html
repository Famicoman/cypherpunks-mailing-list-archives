	Good luck. Overall a positive article, although I've noted one definite 
goof. I wonder if it would be possible to sue this FBI idiot as well as The
Observer?

&gt;                    FINN REJECTS INTERNET CHILD PORN CLAIMS
   __________________________________________________________________________

&gt;      Copyright &amp;copy 1996 Reuter Information Service
      
&gt;   HELSINKI (Aug 26, 1996 10:53 a.m. EDT) - On the eve of a major
&gt;   conference on child sex abuse, a Finnish Internet specialist on Monday
&gt;   angrily dismissed allegations in a British newspaper that his system
&gt;   handled up to 90 percent of child pornography on the Net.
   
[...]
   
&gt;   The newspaper reported the charges, by a U.S. policeman and FBI
&gt;   adviser, in the run-up to an international conference in Stockholm on
&gt;   the commercial sexual exploitation of children starting on Tuesday.
   
&gt;   Finnish police also said they had found no evidence in areas they can
&gt;   investigate that Helsingius's system is now being used to forward
&gt;   child pornography on a large scale.
   
&gt;   "We are working very closely with the authorities and the child
&gt;   protection agencies -- I am always encouraging people to report any
&gt;   incidence of child pornography they see on the Internet to police, so
&gt;   that they can investigate and act," Helsingius told Reuters by
&gt;   telephone.
   
&gt;   The Observer quoted Toby Tyler, a Federal Bureau of Investigation
&gt;   adviser on child abuse and pornography, as saying 75-90 percent of the
&gt;   child pornography he saw on the Internet was forwarded through
&gt;   Helsingius' system.
   
&gt;   Internet remailers are computers which receive and forward messages
&gt;   with a pseudonym or anonymous source.
   
&gt;   There are about five in the world, and they exist to enable anonymous
&gt;   discussion of sensitive subjects -- for instance by victims of child
&gt;   abuse, potential suicides or people in politically repressed
&gt;   societies.

	Five? Someone's miscounted...
   
&gt;   Helsingius said one key reason his system would not be used for
&gt;   pornorgaphy was that it has built-in capacity limitations which make
&gt;   it impossible to send large pictures through it -- only small amounts
&gt;   of text.
   
&gt;   "Also the groups where pictures are carried...are not supported in my
&gt;   server," he said.
   
&gt;   It could be possible to compress and chop up picture material for use
&gt;   through the server but this would involve using "tens or hundreds of
&gt;   separate messages," he said.
   
&gt;   Kai Malmberg, a Helsinki police specialist in Internet affairs, said
&gt;   he had in the past found child pornography remailed through the server
&gt;   but it had stopped since police started investigating.
   
&gt;   "I've found really no evidence of the Finnish remailer being used for
&gt;   child pornography," he said. "But we can't -- we don't want to --
&gt;   check people's mail. That would be like going into the post office and
&gt;   opening all the letters.
   
&gt;   "I believe that he's quite sincere in trying to protect his server for
&gt;   people to discuss sensitive issues," he said.
   
&gt;   Asked if his system could be used to carry child pornography through
&gt;   individual e-mail messages, Helsingius said this was possible but not
&gt;   on a large scale as it does not support e-mail systems which
&gt;   simultaneously send to many recipients.
   
&gt;   But he said it was possible for Internet experts to imitate his
&gt;   remailer address to make it seem as if messages were coming through
&gt;   his system.
   
&gt;   "In a prevous case roughly a year ago we could find a couple of cases
&gt;   of child porn," he said. "It was actually posted in the UK to the UK
&gt;   -- it didn't come to Finland at all but it was being made to look like
&gt;   it came from my server. Anyone can alter the origination information."
   
&gt;   He said all the allegations about his remailer seemed to stem from
&gt;   Tyler, yet he had been unable to contact him. Tyler was travelling to
&gt;   the Stockholm conference on Monday and unavailable for comment.
   
&gt;   "The fact that he's claiming 90 percent of the child porn goes through
&gt;   my remailer is pretty far from the truth. There might be the
&gt;   occasional instance and we are actively working against that,"
&gt;   Helsingius said.
   
&gt;   "My reputation has been tarnished all over Europe. We will take legal
&gt;   action, but we are not quite sure in what country."
