&gt; Sales droids are subservient to market droids...sort of like R2D2, a sales
&gt; droid, getting his marching orders from C3PO, a market droid.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As for spamming, I get enough of it via snail-mail, I don't want to see
&gt; &gt;it in my Inbox too. And, for the record, there are lots of people out
&gt; &gt;there who pay on the bulk charge, not by time. Sending advertising or
&gt; &gt;junk mail to these folks costs them money, maybe not much for the one
&gt; &gt;message you sent, but several thousand over a month of a quarter add up
&gt; &gt;to real money.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There is a time and place for legitimate advertising. I am sure that
&gt; &gt;given time and impetus, a number of clear channel venues will open up to
&gt; &gt;allow precision marketing and sales to happen electronicly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At the moment, it's bad nettiquette...
&gt; 
&gt; The basic problem is that, unlike paper mail, it costs a sender essentially
&gt; nothing to send nearly any size file to as many people as he wishes. This
&gt; is the basic economic fact of the Net at this time. Until this eventually
&gt; changes, spamming will be with us.
&gt; 
&gt; (I understand experts in the field of "spamming" have various names for
&gt; various flavors: spam, velveeta, jerky, etc. I'll call them all "unwanted
&gt; messages.")
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is one of economics and allocation of costs. Other industries
&gt; have the same issues:
&gt; 
&gt; * fax machines: costs of paper are borne by receiver, leading to high bills
&gt; when "junk faxes" are received (and hence some laws restricting such faxes)
&gt; 
&gt; * cellular phones: receiver of calls usually is charged air time. Thus,
&gt; "junk calls" cost money.
&gt; 
&gt; (My physical mailbox probably gets about $1 a day of junk mail, in terms of
&gt; postage paid. More, in terms of costs to print catalogs, fliers, freebies,
&gt; etc. It takes me about 20 seconds, tops, to decide what to discard
&gt; immediately and what to save, so at this point "their costs" &gt; "my costs.")
&gt; 
&gt; In my view, attempting to legislate what is "junk" and what is not junk is
&gt; misguided. (And I suspect it rarely works in halting junk mail.) Junk is in
&gt; the eye of the beholder.
&gt; 
&gt; There are technological fixes which I would favor over attempts to ban
&gt; unwanted messages.
&gt; 
&gt; --Tim May
&gt; 

I agree about the technological fixes. When enough people figure out or 
are shown how to block unwanted messages, the economics of scale 
disappear real fast. Unfortunately, there will always be a ready supply 
of the unwitting, and government's reaction is to legislate rather than 
educate.

Practically, it would be better to allow and promote a technological 
outlet for all of this, as it will never go away, so long as the medium 
exists.
