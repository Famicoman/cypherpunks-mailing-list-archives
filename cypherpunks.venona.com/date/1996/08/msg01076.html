INFORMATION WARFARE: CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONIC CIVIL DEFENSE
September 4-5-6, 1996
Crystal Gateway Marriott Hotel
1700 Jeferson Davis Highway
Arlington, VA 22202

August 14, 1996; Carlisle, PA.  International security experts,
including military general officers responsible for C3I, intelligence
and security professionals from government agencies, and corporate
information assurance and security executives will review
state-of-the-art techniques in countermeasures necessary to combat
information warfare attacks against the information infrastructures of
the United States and allied nations.  Leaders from industry,
government and the international scene will also discuss policy options
for defense as well as response to attacks.

Information Warfare is likely to influence both military operations
other than war (OOTW), and the violent peace with which both law
enforcement and corporate security professionals must concern
themselves. Electronic Civil Defense for the 21st Century is the focus
of this conference.

Information Warfare represents a direct threat to governments,
financial and business information systems of corporations and private
businesses, and the personal privacy of ordinary citizens.  Information
Warfare is a relatively low cost method for less- developed
nation-states or underground organizations and trans-national gangs to
acquire technology, along with tactical and strategic economic
information, from more-developed nations, governments,
corporate/business entities, and individuals.  

Information Warfare is also a means for terrorists, criminals, or
politically-motivated splinter groups to attack their enemies.  Methods
for launching Information Warfare attacks can be done anonymously and
remotely, circumvent laws and detection, and employ an array of
clandestine electronic and human intelligence techniques.
 
Electronic Civil Defense is the guiding concept which unites all
aspects of a nation’s information infrastructure into a unified
mindset.  It’s purpose is to prepare for, and where necessary,
counteract the effects of organized and unorganized attempts on the
part of individuals, terrorist elements, criminal enterprises, or rouge
nations to subvert friendly nations, commercial institutions, and armed
forces through malicious destruction of critical information systems
assets such as banking, medical, or defense-related systems. 

The conference is sponsored by two internationally known experts: Mr.
Winn Schwartau (author of INFORMATION WARFARE: Chaos on the Electronic
Superhighway); and, Mr. Robert Steele (author of various works which
focus on the common theme of "Smart People, Dumb Nations: Bad
Business"), and by the National Computer Security Association (NCSA),
Carlisle, PA.

Speakers include: Dr. Peter Tippett, President, NCSA; Steve Katz, CISO,
Citibank; Sally Katzen, Administrator for Information and Regulatory
Affairs, OMB; Drs. Anders Eriksson and Peter Wallstroem, National
Defense Research Establishment, Dept. of Defense Analysis, Sweden; Dr.
Leroy Pearce, Canada; General Jim McCarthy, USAF (Ret); Capt. Gregory
Blackburn, Director of Information Warfare, OSD/C3I; Air Vice Marshall
Brendon O’Loughlin, Australian Defense Attaché; Ron Eward, Martech,
