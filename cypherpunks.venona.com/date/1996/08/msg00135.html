i, for one, and perhaps others on the list as well, would be interested in hearing
what you mean when you say, "At&amp;t, Microsoft, etc) who are ripping people off on a 
daily basis". 

for example, in what way is AT&amp;T ripping people off? and what about
microsoft? 

i have no use at all for microsoft, and, being a unix person i don't even
use their stuff, but, i wonder how many people use word, excel, powerpoint, etc
that they ripped-off from someone else, without paying microsoft what they are
due for having developed the products. 

in general, i suspect that the rip-off is going the other way. after all, 
no one forces anyone buy from microsoft, AT&amp;T, etc., but people do steal from
them, whenever they have the opportunity. not everyone, of course, but certainly
some do.  

these companies provide products and/or services that you are free to 
purchase or not, as you see fit or can afford.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Okay, so their boss is part of the law making process, subject to the checks
&gt; &gt;&gt; and balances that exist between the three branches of US government. They
&gt; &gt;&gt; are in a position to supply their boss with data and I am personally
&gt; &gt;&gt; impressed with their grasp of some of that data (it sounds to me like they
&gt; &gt;&gt; are telling their boss that hackers like the ones at Defcon are not the
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem).
&gt; 
&gt; It was interesting how the Agent made the point that the FBI was there to 
&gt; enforce laws, not make policy.  Then his Boss's role in the law making process
&gt; was brought up, the Agent said "but any of you can do the same thing, you
&gt; all have a voice" etc etc.  Then he refused to answer political questions 
&gt; based on the fact that he was there as a representative of the FBI, failing
&gt; to see that his Boss is also a representative of the FBI when recommending
&gt; legislation.  (Again, I realize he was "under orders" not to discuss it, I 
&gt; wish he wouldn't try to justify it with obviously faulty logic.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    I think what they are really saying is that they would love to
&gt; &gt;bust most hackers, but since they can't they might as well use some of
&gt; &gt;them to catch the bigger fish.  If they truly did believe in the laws they
&gt; &gt;are supposed to uphold they wouldn't associate with hackers (who commit
&gt; &gt;computer crimes) at all.
&gt; 
&gt; A more cynical view is that they are there to protect some of the biggest
&gt; institutions of "organized crime" (ie: Congress, At&amp;t, Microsoft, etc) who
&gt; are ripping people off on a daily basis from the other organizations who
&gt; refuse to play by their rules.
