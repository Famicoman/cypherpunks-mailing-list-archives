    &gt; Which explains why in the  U.S. the tax authorities take the money first
    &gt; and then require the citizen to be the "accuser" in Tax Court, pleading to
    &gt; get his seized assets back.

    &gt; (To outsiders, the U.S. tax authorities have broad powers to seize
    &gt; properties without any court process, to attach wages, to deputize
    &gt; employers and banks as unpaid tax collectors, and to harass citizens.
    &gt; Citizen-units may sue, of course, but the burden of proof is on them to
    &gt; prove that they are owed a refund. A man who saves money and puts it in his
    &gt; mattress can have it seized and taken from him. He must produce proof that
    &gt; it is his money, never mind that he already paid taxes on it and never mind
    &gt; that there is no way someone who saves currency can have a proper paper
    &gt; trail. So much for "burdens of proof.")

This relates to something I have been wondering about:  If one could
get one's company to pay one in electronic cash, what is to stop one
from piling the coins in a Datahaven somewhere (assuming one existed
that would be usable for these purposes) and say to the IRS: Money?
What money?  Can you find any of my money?  I, uhh... lost it!  Yeah,
that's it!!
