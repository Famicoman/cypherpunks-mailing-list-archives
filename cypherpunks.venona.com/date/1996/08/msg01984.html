<center><h1>Spam (Not the Hormel product)</h1></center>

Anyone familiar with the usenet has seen it.  It's the vile stuff that
brain-dead get-rick-quick scheme promoters and professionsal advertisers
foist upon us all with increasing regularity.  There are (to date) two 
species of spam, differentiated by the mechanism by which they are 
delivered.  Each has its own defining charateristics, each has its own 
sub-species, but both have two things in common: they're made possible by 
the workings of the internet, and they're both examples of the same type 
of 'cost-shifting' that made junk faxes illegal.  Contrary to postal junk 
mail, where the sender bears the full cost of delivery, the spammer bears 
only a fraction of the cost of delivery; the remainder of the costs are 
borne by us, the recipients.  It's a waste of your bandwidth, your disk 
space, and your time.

<dl>
<dt><b>email spam</b>
<dd>Messages delivered by electronic mail to large numbers of recipients 
who <b>did not</b> ask for or otherwise solicit the messages.  It's the 
junk mail of the 21st century, only worse.

<p><dt><b>usenet spam</b>
<dd>Messages delivered by usenet to large numbers of newsgroups whose 
chartered topics are unrelated to (and may even explicitly forbid) the 
topic of the message.
</dl>

<p>
Not enough people seem to
realize that there are constructive ways to deal with it, and to reduce
the chance that you'll have to deal with it again in the future.

  <h2>What NOT to do</h2>

<tr><td>
  The most effective is to <a href = "http://www.metareality.com/~nathan/visit.cgi/html.StopIt">write some 
  polite email</a> to the administrator of the site from which the spam 
  originated.

  <p>You'll soon learn that most system administrators are very unhappy 
  about users who spam the net.  It's 
  always gratifying when they write back to tell you that the offending 
  account has been <a href="http://www.metareality.com/~nathan/visit.cgi/html.Spam.Results">terminated.</a>

  <p>Start reading <a 
  href="usenet://news.admin.net-abuse.misc">news.admin.net-abuse.misc</a> 
  to learn more about how to deal with spammers.

  <p>If there's a 1-800 number, call it to express your displeasure.  
  It might please you to note that 1-800 numbers typically cost them a 
  small amount of money with each call.  How much do you pay for your disk 
  space and bandwidth with each unsolicited bit of email?  It's only fair, 
  right?

  <p>Grab your telephone, or even pay them a visit in person.  You 
  generally have to have access to a unix command line to find the phone 
  numbers and addresses, unless you're dealing with the same <a 
  href="http://www.metareality.com/~nathan/visit.cgi/spam/html.Offenders">spammers that have been 
  bothering me</a>.  Why stick to email?  If they're in your area, tell 
  them face-to-face that you object to their tactics.

</td><td>

  Don't post a follow-up message in the same newsgroup.  Do you 
  <b>really</b> think that the spammer is going to re-visit thousands of 
  newsgroups to see what people had to say?

  <p>The same goes for mailing lists.  If you get spammed via a mailing 
  list, <b>never</b> reply to the list.  Your words will just get 
  re-broadcast to everyone else on the list, thus doubling the nuisance 
  created by the spammer.

been severely questioned in light of their (mis)handling of the 
Moneyworld/CHAG spammer.  30 days between announcing that the situation 
is being dealt with and finally cutting off a spammer with 
message-per-week spamming speed?  This is pretty disgusting in light of 
the good press MCI got when they announced their spam policies.  It's 
starting to look more like a PR stunt than a policy statement.  I 
can only take comfort knowing that at least their sysadmins are aware of 
(and frustrated with) the situation.

<p>I must disclaim that civil legal issues may be involved in the
MCI/Moneyworld dispute, so there may be things going on that the public
isn't aware of.  Still, for MCI not to have covered its corporate ass does
not speak well of MCI's sincerity or the competence of MCI's lawyers.

<p>I think this is a bad idea, since it attempts to legitimize 
junk email, by implying that if an email address is not on the list, it's 
prefectly OK to send junk email.  The other problem with this idea is 
that there are going to be several of them, and no junkmailer is going to 
filter their list using each "service."  Thus, it will be up to the 
recipients to track down all of the "services."

<p>Currently there are at least three running.  One is at

spamming policy, and the terms and conditions for my own ISP, <a 
href="http://webfaq.halcyon.com/faq/nwn/nwntac.txt">Northwest Nexus</a> 
(a.k.a. halcyon.com).

<p>I should note that while Northwest Nexus doesn't describe spamming in 
their terms of service, they have booted more than one spammer in the 
past.  It surprises me greatly that they aren't explicit about this in 
their published terms and conditions.

<li> The true beauty of Usenet is the way it allows free communication.
You can be rich/poor/ugly/
<br> religious/atheist or a member of any
race/religion or be young/old... That's the wonder - everyone can talk to
one another and share ideas.
<br> Then spam comes along. It fills up
newsgroups with so much noise that no one reads it any more. That
<br>
wondrous method of communication has been lost. That's why I hate spam. 

<br><br><comment pool31_3.odyssee.net>

<li> You just don't get it, do you?

<p> No, deleting one piece of email doesn't take much.  Then again,
<b>neither does appealing to a system administrator</b> to have the
spammer shut down.  Two or three bits of junk a day really is something 
I can live with, but <b>I don't want to</b>.  So why should I?  

<p>Two or three <b>bits of trash</b> by the roadside won't mean the end of
the world.  Tossing empty cans out the window costs less than having your
trash hauled away - what a <b>great opportunity</b> to save money!  If litter
were acceptable, a public beach would be no place to spend an afternoon. 

<p> Postal mail costs the sender with each mailing.  This keeps junk
postal mail to <b>tolerable levels.</b> EMail costs the sender maybe
$20/month, period.  Are you so fucking stupid that <b>you don't
realize</b> what a cesspool the net would be if this were allowed to grow
unchecked?

<br><br><comment whatever.net>

<li> People complain about spam and mass E-mailers.  But my question is:
<br>
what's the big deal?  Does it REALLY take THAT much PRECIOUS time out
<br>
of your day to click and delete a piece of E-mail? I think that the
<br>
people complaining about others taking advantage of an excellent
<br>
business opportunity ought to just relax a bit.  And just HOW does it 
<br>
COST you to deal with SPAM?  With ISP's dropping access prices and
<br>
providing unlimited access to the internet, how could it possibly
<br>
COST someone to get an E-mail message?  I think you people really need
<br>
to just kick back and relax already.  Geeze, if it wasn't SPAM what
<br>
else would you find to complain about?
<br>

<br><br><comment pm3-26.pacificnet.net>

<li> Spam isn't about content, spam is about quantity and cost shifting.  
<p>
TV spam would be the same ad on every channel at the same time.
<p>
Print spam would be junk mail sent postage due or charge-on-delivery.
<p>
With the ads on TV and in newspapers, the advertisers pay the expenses 
associated with publishing their ads.  With net spam, the recipients pay the 
expenses associated with carrying the ads.  That is the key difference.  

<p>The costs of ads in traditional media help to support the very media that
deliver the ads.  With net.spam, there are no costs, and the ads just
serve to sap the medium.  All you need is a free trial account (AOL,
interramp, or earthlink, etc are famous for this), and you can broadcast a
huge amount of spam before anyone notices.  Or, you can pay for an account
with MCI, and broadcast huge amounts of spam for 30 days after the
sysadmins realize what's going on. 

<ol>-NW</ol> 
<br><br><comment whatever.net>

<li> Net-based spam is not the only form of spam. There is spam in print
<br>
and spam in TV advertising. Wouldn't you say every Calvin Klein ad
<br>
on TV, magazines or billboards is spam? How about Budweiser,
<br>
Lite beer, and McDonalds commercials.
<br>

<br>
If you see any type of advertising that offends your senses, you
<br>
should feel free to boycott the products, ask your friends to
<br>
boycott the products, etc. If the company has an 800 number or
<br>
web site, let them know that you find their advertising offensive.
<br>

<br><br><comment 166.44.42.89>

<li> I am really, really, REALLY tired of being solicited to buy things 
<br>
whenever I log on to my computer. I mean, I pay for the phone line, 
<br>
the software, the hardware, the accounts and my time is worth money 
<br>
as well. I get a LOT of e-mail and a SIZEABLE portion of it is junk 
<br>
e-mail. When I read news, about 10% of it is junk e-mail; more if it
<br>
is a small newsgroup. I want to know what uninformed idiot is selling
<br>
my address, or where these people are GETTING it. I have never bought
<br>
anything over the computer. I have bounced unsolicited junk back to
<br>
the people who send it. (I love how righteously indignant these people
<br>
are: they send you mail and expect you to buy something from them and
<br>
when you fail to perform as expected with joy and gratitude...if you 
<br>
should, in fact, protest them wasting your time and resources...they
<br>
get downright rude and abusive. The presumptuousness of it just really
<br>
annoys me.) The capper is that I did some artwork for the anti-Canter-
<br>
and-Siegel "Green Card Lawyers" tees Joel Furr was offering a while ago.
<br>
The ultimate clue that I am not interested in spam of any sort, but how
<br>
could they know? It's just amusing. Let it be known that I am not a
<br>
test market, nor will I buy any of your crap, be it face cream, thigh
<br>
cream, green cards, stock options, modems, books, herbs, or the golden
<br>
goose itself. Not interested. I don't know you, I have no reason to trust
<br>
you, and you are spamming MY mailbox and expecting ME to reward this with
<br>
money. No, thank you. I've been online for more than 5 years, and I 
<br>
really long for the "good old days" before the Net was "cool".
<br>

<br>
There ya go. My tuppence. Now...where do I go to put my name on the
<br>
"Don't Send This Person Crap Mail" list? (Laugh)

<li> SPAM is only going to go away if we make sure companies learn that SPAMming doesn't get costumers to buy thier products and it does more to stop potential costumers from buying thier products.
<br><br><comment por-or10-14.ix.netcom.com>

<li> I've heard a couple of different conflicting stories about the origins of the use of the word <i>spam</i> in this context.  
<br>

<br>

<ul><p><li>The most popular version suggests that is was inspired by the
Monty Python skit in which virtually every item on some restaurant's menu
includes spam in some form or other.  The waiter's recitation of the menu
becomes unintelligible except for '...and spam, spam with..., spam salad,
...with spam, spam mixed with..." and so on.  It really picks up when the
Vikings start chanting "spam-spam spam, spam, spam-spam spam, spam...." ad
nauseum.  This is what the net would be like if this stuff was allowed to 
continue unchecked.  If that's not a horrifying thought, maybe you should 
see the skit in question.

<p><li>My personal belief is that geeks (who make up much of the 'net
community (myself included), much of Monty Python's audience, and probably
most of Monty Python's cast) just tend to use the word spam when more
appropriate words don't come to mind readily.  For no particularly good
reason, it really stuck this time.
