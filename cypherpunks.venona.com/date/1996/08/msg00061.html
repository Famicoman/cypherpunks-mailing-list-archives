	I had hoped that normal government incompetence would prevent them from
passing something. Well, there's still hope that it'll get clogged up, or that
the courts will toss it out - somehow I think they won't like the idea of
taps without a court order, for instance (giving up a judicial prerogative). I
am also somewhat puzzled by the racketeering law reference - I had thought that
federal racketeering laws allowed civil forfeiture sans conviction (shudder)?
The "funding" for telephone companies sounds suspiciously like funding Digital
Telephony.

&gt;         WHITE HOUSE, KEY LAWMAKERS AGREE ON ANTI-TERRORISM PROPOSALS

&gt;      Copyright &amp;copy 1996 Nando.net
&gt;      Copyright &amp;copy 1996 The Associated Press
      
&gt;   WASHINGTON (Aug 1, 1996 09:53 a.m. EDT) -- After wrangling with key
&gt;   Republican lawmakers, the White House has won agreement on a package
&gt;   of anti-terrorism measures that would expand wiretapping authority and
&gt;   tighten airport security.
   
[...]

&gt;   But omitted from the agreement was a central part of Clinton's
&gt;   proposals, a study of chemical markers in explosives, called taggants,
&gt;   which had been heavily criticized by some Republicans. Also rejected
&gt;   was a provision to allow the FBI to get information on suspected
&gt;   terrorists from hotels, telephone companies and storage facilities.
   
[...]

   The agreement also would allow prosecution of suspected terrorists
   under federal racketeering laws, which would make anyone convicted
   subject to asset forfeitures and longer sentences.
   
&gt;   The negotiators, led by Panetta and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said
&gt;   they hoped to have a package ready for a vote by week's end, before
&gt;   Congress leaves for its August recess.
   
&gt;   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said earlier in the
&gt;   day that final passage before the recess appeared unlikely. "I don't
&gt;   see how in the world we can get it done" by then, Lott told reporters.
   
&gt;   Lott and other GOP leaders summoned Attorney General Janet Reno,
&gt;   Panetta and FBI Director Louis Freeh to a meeting today to explain why
&gt;   some of the FBI's anti-terrorism funds haven't been spent.
   
&gt;   "We are increasingly concerned that monies and authorities already
&gt;   granted to the administration are not being used effectively or at
&gt;   all," Lott, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and House Majority
&gt;   Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, wrote in a letter to Clinton.
   
&gt;   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the Republican
&gt;   assertions were "misleading."
   
&gt;   Gingrich and Lott also proposed that a blue-ribbon commission review
&gt;   the government's anti-terrorism policy -- a move that would delay
&gt;   congressional action. The new package includes such a commission for
&gt;   longer-term legislative proposals, Craig said.
   
&gt;   He said the lawmakers' aides planned to work through the night to
&gt;   draft the proposals into a package that could be put to a vote before
&gt;   week's end.
   
&gt;   "I feel very positive at this moment," Craig told reporters Wednesday
&gt;   night.
   
&gt;   Craig said the proposals included multipoint wiretaps, which allow law
&gt;   enforcement agents to monitor all phone calls made by a suspected
&gt;   terrorist, rather than just those from a specific telephone, as well
&gt;   as emergency wiretaps, which are valid for 48 hours without a court
&gt;   order.
   
[... yeah, right]

&gt;   Craig stressed that the new wiretap provisions would include "some
&gt;   privacy language that will protect people."
   
&gt;   Other proposals on which accord was reached include the use of special
&gt;   technology to make it easier to trace telephone numbers called by
&gt;   suspected terrorists and a trust fund to reimburse phone companies for
&gt;   expenses they incur in that area.
   
&gt;   Craig listed the proposals but gave few details, which had yet to be
&gt;   worked out.
