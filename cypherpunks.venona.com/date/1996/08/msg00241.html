&gt; 
&gt; &gt;In my experience they don't get hassled because they get the requisite
&gt; &gt;permits and act in good faith. Many of these small businesses and street
&gt; &gt;vendors are 'hassled' because they are unwilling or unable to meet basic
&gt; &gt;commen sense standards of conduct and go out of there way to circumvent
&gt; &gt;regulations and in some cases commen sense.
&gt; 
&gt; I was there when Food Not Bombs got busted in San Francisco. They tried to
&gt; get a permit from the Health Department, but the HD refused to even process
&gt; the application. FNB finally won the case. I guess next time the HD will be
&gt; smarter, process the application and deny it. At present, SF has a
&gt; hands-off policy in regards to Food Not Bombs.

What exactly was the reason for the refusal to process the form? At that
point the FNB folks should have started a suite against the city and not
gone to the park. If they did they should have been very careful about
advertising the HD's refusal and making it clear that their presence and
actions there were a form of political disobedience.

There are good ways to tweak a nose and there are bad ways. Sounds like
these folks chose a bad way to begin with. I am glad to hear that justice
won out in the end. I bet next time the HD just processes the form. Is the
person in charge of the HD elected or appointed? If appointed than start a
suite against them as well as the department.

&gt; The feeding was never the real issue. The heavy political indoctrination
&gt; that came with it was. Patrick McHenry handed out the food, screaming in a
&gt; mike, in front of the Federal Building (without interfering with
&gt; pedestrians in any way) as the Feds came out on their lunch hour, having to
&gt; listen to him complain about President Bush's CIA background, calling Bush
&gt; a drug dealer, and demanding to know why there was no money for food when
&gt; there was plenty of money for nukes.

I would have gone back the next day w/ a larger amp.

&gt; Now can we please let this thread (at least on the list) die?

Certainly.
