&gt;	CINCINNATI, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- A federal appellate court in Cincinnati  
&gt;ruled this week that faxes are not necessarily legally binding if the 
&gt;receiving party does not know the communication is coming. 
&gt;	The case stemmed from a 1991-92 strike by 200 Clow Water System Co.  
&gt;workers who were represented by the United Steelworkers. 
&gt;	The court ruled the Coshocton company, a division of McWane Inc., did  
&gt;not violate federal labor law when it hired replacement workers after 
&gt;the union transmitted an unconditional fax offer to return to work in 
&gt;February 1992. 
&gt;	The union sent its offer by fax at 4:35 p.m. on a Friday, 25 minutes  
&gt;before the plant closed for the day. The intended recipient claimed he 
&gt;checked for any communications at 4:30, and when he saw there weren't 
&gt;any, went home. 
&gt;	On Saturday, Clow hired 80 replacement workers.  
&gt;	The National Labor Relations Board later held that actual knowledge  
&gt;of the fax was not required. The board said the parties had communicated 
&gt;by facsimile during their negotiations, and that the facsimile was sent 
&gt;and received. 
&gt;	But the appellate court said the union had sent only four facsimile  
&gt;transmissions during 13 months of negotiations. 
&gt;	``All of these facsimiles contained contract proposals -- a  
&gt;communication intended to be examined and considered, not a 
&gt;communication having legal import in and of itself,'' the court said, 
&gt;ordering the NLRB ruling against Clow must be re-evaluated. 
&gt;	The court said facsimile and electronic mail are becoming  
&gt;increasingly common forms of business communication, however, both 
&gt;parties must agree to the use of such media and must be notified when 
&gt;messages are sent. 
&gt;	``The critical part of this case is that (the fax) was sent only 25  
&gt;minutes before the plant closed,'' David Peck, a lawyer with Taft, 
&gt;Stettinius &amp; Hollister, the law firm that represented Clow, told United 
&gt;Press International Wednesday. ``Normal courtesy is to call first and 
&gt;again after to confirm that a fax has been received.'' 
&gt;	The union claimed Clow committed an unfair labor practice by  
&gt;permanently replacing economic strikers after the union made an 
&gt;unconditional offer, as required by federal law, to return to work. 
&gt;	But the court said the fax transmission itself wasn't the issue.  
&gt;	``The key to this case is simply fair notice,'' the court said in its  
&gt;decision. ``If the parties did not agree to the method of communication 
&gt;utilized, and if there is no pattern of conduct reflecting acquiescence 
&gt;to the method of communication utilized, we will not impute notice of 
&gt;the communication to the recipient. 
&gt;	``Communication by facsimile has simplified and streamlined the way  
&gt;in which business in conducted in this country,'' the court added. 
&gt;``This technological advance provides a valuable service and benefit, 
&gt;and our holding should not be taken as an indication that parties should 
&gt;not use facsimiles to conduct their affairs.''
