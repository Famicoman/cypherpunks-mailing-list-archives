&gt;&gt;&gt; This is bizzare.  I have gotten three messages with this message.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is someone at Netscape canceling messages?  (mcom.com is the old
&gt;&gt;&gt; domain name
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Netscape.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone have any ideas on this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't have a clue what it is, but it's sure pissing me off.  I've
&gt;&gt; gotten about 15 or so of these messages in the past two hours.  If
&gt;&gt; it's an honest error, then someone better fix it real fast; if some
&gt;&gt; loser is jerking us around, ......
&gt; 
&gt; Some list redirector of somesort has gone wonky at Netscape.  (Take a
&gt; look at the headers if you do not believe me.  They are originating
&gt; off of some internal lists at mcom.com, the original Netscape domain.)
&gt; 
&gt; Cypherpunks is not the only list effected by this.  I am getting these
&gt; weird messages on wwwsecurity as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Since it is Friday, I expect that this will be with us until someone
&gt; gets in the office on Monday.

We have a gateway here that gateways mailing lists into newsgroups and
sends posts back out to the mailing lists.  There was a problem with it
which caused these strange suppression messages.  I got the person
responsible to come in and fix it, so there should be no more messages
like that, I hope.

What I'd prefer is a configurable POP server for an ISP - something that you
could set to, say, only send a brief header and 1st couple lines of any message
that is either over a certain size, repeated, or passed the limit for messages
from a given host.  So you could set certain people to have their messages pass
directly through, something like cypherpunks might get more and all others
could be limited to something like 10/day.  Have all of this configured right,
as well has host-end filtering/rejecting and such tasks would be done with the
high bandwidth a host has, as opposed to your average dialup link.

Dole stands for nothing, and Clinton stands for everything.

Any resemblance between their election platforms and what they

He would say anything to get elected.

&gt; Clinton is keeping ITAR and signed CDA.  But not having the religious

Lame ducks don't have to soften, on anything. That's what's fun about being 
a lame duck.

&gt; The courts seem to be throwing out CDA much faster than ITAR (some fast
&gt; track to the supreme court built into the law).  It also seems like
&gt;  ITAR
&gt; is the more important thing to fix (it is easier to move pornography
&gt;  etc
&gt; out of the US than major software companies). 
&gt; 
&gt; So it seems Dole is the better vote.  Is this important enough to many
&gt; cypherpunks to actually determine their vote?

If the Republican candidate had been Forbes, there might have been a "don't 
let the great be the enemy of the good" argument against voting 
Libertarian. As it stands now, Dole is, at best, arguably the "lesser of 2 
evils," which still comes out evil in my book. As the designated partisan 
Libertarian on the list, I urge all cypherpunks to vote their consciences 
and pick Harry Browne and Jo Jorgensen. The mere fact that the media is 
[grudgingly] covering us suggests we are finally doing something right, and 
Harry is winning many Internet polls despite much fawning, hopeful coverage 
for the big-eared billionaire hypocrite stealth-candidate, who has no 
position but certainly would enjoy having the TLAs investigate his enemies.

I fully accept that it is likely Dole or Clinton will win, but I think it 
will fill an important cypherpunk goal if the Libertarian Party candidates 
get a vote large enough to be the margin of victory, and I will be very 
proud of my vote, no matter who wins this election. Vote your consciences 
for your own sake, and the sake of the children who will inherit the debt 
of the irresponsible statists in power now.

! Reprint of a story from the Los Angeles Times.
! 
! LOS ANGELES -- Even among his fellow skinheads, Tom Leyden stood out as an
! angry warrior.
! 
! Leyden recalls prowling the streets at night, pummeling "blacks, Hispanics
! and longhairs" with his steel-toed boots. In the Marines, he kept a copy
! of Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" next to his bunk. At home, he hung a Nazi
! flag over the baby's crib.
! 
! Leyden, 30, might seem like a dubious candidate to lead a crusade against
! white supremacists. But this tattooed high school dropout has broken with
! his racist past and joined ranks with an unlikely ally -- the Simon
! Wiesenthal Center.
! 
! It is a rare and unexpected alliance.
! 
! Leyden is the first skinhead to voluntarily lend his expertise to the
! Wiesenthal Center since it opened in Los Angeles 19 years ago. Skeptical
! leaders of the center -- a watchdog organization that fights anti-Semitism
! and other forms of prejudice -- greeted his arrival last month with
! suspicion. They wondered whether he was a spy.
! 
! But Leyden offered inside information about neo-Nazi methods: how they
! recruit young members by inciting racial violence on school campuses and
! by distributing music that preaches the death of Jews, blacks and other
! groups.
! 
! He also discounted his disillusionment with a movement that labeled his
! own mother inferior because she was handicapped. He spoke out about the
! angst of watching his sons -- ages 4 and 2 -- grow up as hatemongers
! saluting the Nazi and Confederate flags.
! 
! And he recounted his decision to leave his wife of six years for a chance
! to redeem himself.
! 
! "I got the impression that this was a person who has had a profound change
! of heart and who is willing to tell the world, 'I was wrong,'"" recalled
! Rabbi Marvin Hier, the Wiesenthal Center's founder. "He is saying,
! 'Everything I've stood for in the last decade was for nothing.' That's
! admitting to a life's mistake."
! 
! Now the Wiesenthal Center and Leyden are putting his firsthand knowledge
! of neo-Nazi activities to work -- a plan that has earned Leyden a
! "traitor" label among former skinhead associates.
! 
! The center has arranged for Leyden to address a national hate conference
! in Miami in October. Leyden is also scheduled to speak about hate groups
! in the military during an upcoming visit to Fort Bragg, the North Carolina
! Army base where swastikas were found last month painted on the doors of
! rooms occupied by white soldiers.
! 
! Leyden's family now fears for its safety. He said late-night callers
! frequently hang up or leave obscene messages.
! 
! But Leyden refuses to let the threats scare him.
! 
! "I think Tom has already removed the tattoos inside," said Rabbi Abraham

When posting an article that was originally HTML, perhaps you could save it

Makes it a little easier to read.

Subject: You have your papers, please? [off-topic]

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Today, I returned to school, a bright shiny venture into my junior year.
Only slightly dampened by the closing of campuses - well, I should explain.
High school campuses have typically been "open" here in Albuquerque, which
to put it simply means that school is dismissed for lunch and opens again after
it. But, in the traditional school style, that is, punishing the many for the
crimes of the few, the politically-controlled and very partisan school board 
decided last year to close them, which would of course stop all the fights and
robberies and graffiti during the noon hour, and not push it up two hours at all.
Of course. This is rather drastic, so in an atypical show of clemency the people
who do things to me for my own good decided to phase it in. Thus it affects me
not at all - or so I thought. So my mood today wasn't really affected by this
violation of rights, because I had my mind on other things.

Until I was informed that I must carry my school-issued picture ID that is
barely recognizable as human at all times, because at any time on campus a
Gestapo agent disguised as a "campus aide" could demand to make sure that
my papers were in order. When going to lunch I was carded to leave campus.
Taking out my anger on someone who probably didn't deserve it, I said, 
"Are my papers in order, mein Fuehrer?" My, my, if looks could kill. The
disturbing thing is that while I know it really is not a big deal to have
to carry a dumb school ID so that bad rules can be enforced, no one around
me understood why I was upset. I am worried that happenings of this sort will
give Big Brother an opening for universal IDs and internal passports. No one
will question it because they've been doing it their whole lives. And of course,
anyone who does object must be a pervert, criminal, or other social deviant.

I thank all of you for your fine detective work.

I found this on the tsmenace list without an attribute.
It was a strange place for it, as it was cypherpunk in content.
But as it applies anywhere, (and the using PGP on a political
activist list project continues), at least they are making some
progress in their thinking. The article drew no flames whatsoever.

I will Mr. Perry, happily inform the tsmenace list (tsmenace@zoom.com)

  Does it matter?  Shound't the fight here be in the courts and Congress as
opposed to the President?  The problem here is a constant one.  If you vote
Republican, it opens the door for less stringent economic laws but greater
restriction on social freedoms.  The Democrats are tradtionaly the
opposite.
  It's like the Janus. They speak of countermanding viewpoints, but in the
end the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  There will undoubtely be
watered down versions of both laws in effect.  My guess is that a new ITAR
style would run along the lines of current arms trafficking regulations. 
That means no trading yer crypto with the so-called rogue states. 
Impossible, but we are talking about the U.S. Government here.  I have no
idea how they could enforce anything like the CDA.  Possibly they would
promote the use of restictive services in browsers.  Who knows.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dole says he would fix the ITAR problem, but try to keep something like
&gt; CDA. 
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton is keeping ITAR and signed CDA.  But not having the religious
&gt; right he might soften on CDA.
&gt; 
&gt; The courts seem to be throwing out CDA much faster than ITAR (some fast
&gt; track to the supreme court built into the law).  It also seems like ITAR
&gt; is the more important thing to fix (it is easier to move pornography etc
&gt; out of the US than major software companies). 
&gt; 
&gt; So it seems Dole is the better vote.  Is this important enough to many
&gt; cypherpunks to actually determine their vote?

WHAT'S NEW

The Democratic convention's online chat program has begun!  It's crucial
that Netizens make net concerns a high profile issue in the online chats
this year.  You can do this by showing up and simply asking the right
questions.  Does the candidate think the Communications Decency Act is
an effective method of shielding kids from material online, or parental
control?  Does the candidate support the use of privacy-enhancing 
encryption technology?  Does the candidate support program such as
THOMAS, that put government info in the hands of the people?

If you don't ask these questions, they'll never know we care.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It appears that the 128-bit download of MS Internet Explorer had
