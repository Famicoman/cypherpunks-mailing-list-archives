Didn't (left-radical) Abbie Hoffman's anarchy bible _Steal This Book_ have 
some bombmaking instructions also?  I don't recall civilization falling in 
1968 or thereabouts when STB was published.

&gt; &gt;i'm not exactly sure what an acid bomb is, but according to my book, The
&gt; &gt;Anarchist Cookbook, that I bought in 1972 (was the internet around back
&gt; &gt;then?), there is a compound called "picric acid" that is "more powerful
&gt; &gt;than TNT, but has some disadvantages".
&gt; 
&gt; The ARPANET (or ARPANet, or Arpanet...) was around then. (I had an account
&gt; on it, circa 1973...not very useful for me.)
&gt; 
&gt; I also got my copy of "The Anarchist Cookbook" back around then. It was in
&gt; the news locally when the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's office attempted
&gt; to have it removed from the local bookstores....this removed it all right,
&gt; as the stacks of copies sold out as quickly as they could be received and
&gt; unpacked.
&gt; 
&gt; (As others have noted over the years, much of the advice is probably bogus
&gt; and even dangerous. Not being an explosives dabbler, I wouldn't know.)
&gt; 
&gt; If Feinswine gets her ban on bomb-making information passed, and this is
&gt; upheld by the courts (doubtful), the sites will be swamped with information
&gt; queries, and fooling around with bombs will become more popular amongst the
&gt; teenage set that has not expressed much interest in such things the past
&gt; couple of decades.
&gt; 
&gt; The more things change, the more they remain the same.

&gt; Buy a section of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches long, threaded on both
&gt; ends.  Buy two metal caps to fit.  These are standard items in hardware
&gt; stores.  Drill a 1/16th hole in the center of the pipe. This is easy with a
&gt; good drill bit. Hanson is a good brand to use.  Screw a metal cap tightly
&gt; on one end. Fill the pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with black powder.
&gt; Do not pack
&gt; the powder. Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe to make it settle.  You want
&gt; the powder loose.  For maximum explosive effect, you need dry, fine powder
&gt; sitting loose in a very rigid container.
