&gt; &gt;   I have added you to my computerized list of individuals who advocate

&gt; &gt; I am going to go to the law library and see what my options are, with
&gt; &gt; respect to filing a petition to have you deported out of the United
&gt; &gt; States.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is not a rhetorical statement.
&gt;
&gt; First off Alan posted private mail to the list. In this case mail
&gt; that was more than simply personal.
&gt;
&gt; Secondly unless Alan withdraws his allegations I will bring proceedings
&gt; against him for libel. While I accept his right to free speech I do
&gt; not accept that he has a right to attempt to restrict mine with his
&gt; threats of deportation.

Alan, look at (3)(A)(iii) of the relevant statute. (3)(B) might also apply.

Section 212 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.Code 1001, et
seq., as amended by Public Law 101-549 of November 29, 1990), reads as follows:

Classes of Excludable Aliens - Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the
following describes classes of excludable aliens who are ineligible to receive
visas and who shall be excluded from admission into the United States.

(1) HEALTH - RELATED GROUNDS.--
 (A) IN GENERAL. -- Any Alien--
  (i)   who is determined (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services) to have a communicable disease
        of public health significance,
  (ii)  who is determined (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services in consultation with to Attorney
        General)--
   (I)   to have a physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with
         the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property,
         safety, or welfare of the alien or others, or
   (II)  to have a physical or mental disorder and a history of behavior
         associated with the disorder which behavior has posed a threat to the
         property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others and which
         behavior is likely  to recur or to lead to other harmful behavior or
  (iii) who is determined (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services) to be a drug abuser or addict,
      is excludable.
 (B) WAIVER AUTHORIZED.--
  For provisions authorizing waiver of certain clauses of subparagraph (A),
  see subsection (g).

         offense), or
   (II)  a violation of (or a conspiracy to violate) any law or regulation of a
         State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a
         controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled
         Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)),
        is excludable.
  (ii)  EXCEPTION.-- clause (i)(I) shall not apply to an alien who committed
        only one crime if--

         to a prison or correctional institution imposed for the crime) more
         than 5 years before the date of application for visas or other
         documentation and the date of application for admission to the United
         States, or
   (II)  the maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien was
         convicted (or which the alien admits having committed or of which the
         acts that the alien admits having committed constituted the essential
         elements) did not exceed imprisonment for one year and, the alien was
         not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months

what Phil says, but I don't like people who threaten libel lawsuits over
something said on the Internet.
