	They're arresting this guy because he had one mention of a Molotov
Cocktail? Why am I reminded of the Haymarket trials? Where's a Governor
Altgeld when you need him? Admittedly, this guy doesn't seem too bright... but
if that were a reason to lock him up, the prisons would be even more crowded
than they are now.

&gt;Anarchist charged with advocating government overthrow

&gt;   _(c) Copyright 1996 Nando.net _
   
&gt;    New York Times
    
   
   
&gt;   JONESBORO, Ga. -- An 18-year-old self-styled anarchist who allegedly
&gt;   distributed a free, homemade pamphlet with anti-government rhetoric
&gt;   has been charged with advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government.
   
[...]

&gt;   Clayton County police Lt. Larry Gibson said Moreland turned himself in
&gt;   Sunday. Authorities obtained an arrest warrant for Moreland Saturday
&gt;   after the pipe bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, although police say
&gt;   they don't think he played any role in the crime.
   
&gt;   "He told us he was only interested in destroying property, and I don't
&gt;   think he fully understands the ramifications," Gibson said. "Whatever
&gt;   he was up to, we wanted to nip it in the bud."
   
&gt;   Moreland had been under investigation since July 8 when authorities
&gt;   received a copy of a pamphlet called "Rise Above." Police traced the
&gt;   pamphlets to a mail box service in a shopping center allegedly rented
&gt;   in Moreland's name.
   
&gt;   The pamphlet was laced with with anti-police cartoons, obscenities,
&gt;   and anarchist slogans. The one overt reference to violence was an
&gt;   illustration of a "Molotov cocktail" on the same sheet with a recipe
&gt;   for "soy milk" made from water-soaked soybeans, sugar and vanilla and
&gt;   strained through a T-shirt.
