Anybody want to give this guy The Business? Earlier attempts didn't seem
to sink in.

&gt;
&gt;I am posting again to hopefully clear up my last post on this topic.  I
&gt;have received a dozen e-mail replies since I posted less than a day ago. 
&gt;I believe I poorly represented my request earlier.
&gt;
&gt;I am retired professional with several years of training and experience in
&gt;intelligence analysis and cryptanalysis.  The encryption scheme I
&gt;developed was employed for 3 years for passing sensitive data over
&gt;unsecure channels.  Working for the government, the original program was
&gt;written for DOS and enjoyed the benefit of physical security.  That is to
&gt;say, access to the encryption program itself was carefully restricted.
&gt;
&gt;Where I feel I was unclear is on the key to the scheme's security.  Any
&gt;encryption scheme can be cracked provided the cryptanalyst has enough of a
&gt;sample to work with, enough time, and/or enough processing power.  My
&gt;encryption scheme relies on data bursts of time-sensitive packets.  Each
&gt;machine running the program has its own time and packet signature.  The
&gt;unique signatures make it impossible (nothing is impossible) to decrypt a
&gt;complete file without access to both the sender's and receiver's
&gt;signatures.  Even then it would take an enormous amount of processing
&gt;power to crack (more than big business can justify, but not much for major
&gt;governments).  The only way to obtain a computer's signature (which is
&gt;easily changed on a regular basis), is to have physical access to the
&gt;computer's encryption application and support files.
&gt;
&gt;With the help of a more experienced DOS programmer, an application was
&gt;built that provided adequate protection that would increase the time
&gt;required to extract a computer's signature (even if one knew exactly how
&gt;to do it), that it was impractical to attempt.
&gt;
&gt;I am now porting the application to the Mac with the intent to sell it to
&gt;a private contractor that is developing RISC-based computers for
&gt;specialized use in the government.  I have been assured that a PPC native
&gt;application will run on the computers, and was encouraged to develop the
&gt;application.  Mostly what I need to know is how long it would take a
&gt;super-human cracker to obtain a signature and how she would do it.  If I
&gt;can increase the expected time to 96+ hours, I'm in business (I always
&gt;assume half of my best guess - 48 hours is the required specification).
&gt;
&gt;I am developing the code with the help of an excellent Mac programmer. 
&gt;The problem is, that neither of us can crack it at all, although we know
&gt;that is theoretically possible.  He lacks sufficient crypto understanding,
&gt;and I lack sufficient computer knowledge.  Working together we make little
&gt;progress, and truthfully don't have enough time to develop and crack at
&gt;the same time.  I will not be comfortable with the final product until
&gt;someone cracks it and I have a sound understanding of the weaknesses that
&gt;I have not considered.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, MacPGP is a GREAT program.  I didn't mean to belittle any of the
&gt;PGP programs.  PGP carries much more protection than necessary for it's
&gt;intended and practical uses.  Granted, it could use a new interface, but
&gt;it is certainly functional and not lacking in features.  Initially, I
&gt;considered releasing a public version of my application in response to the
&gt;need for a more Mac-like encryption program.  There is no reason for the
&gt;average Mac user to switch from PGP to my program.  It lacks (and will
&gt;always lack) the features of MacPGP, and although it is more secure than
&gt;PGP the user must accept some increased inconvenience to realize the bulk
&gt;of the added security.  For most users, this is adding overkill to
&gt;overkill.
&gt;
&gt;I extend my apologies for posting this huge message off topic, but I felt
&gt;I had grossly misrepresented my request.  I feared the influx of e-mail
&gt;tomorrow morning if I didn't clarify.  I appreciate all those that
&gt;extended advice.  I will follow up on much of it, and I thank those who
&gt;replied.
&gt;
