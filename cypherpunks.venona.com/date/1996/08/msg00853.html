	I'm not sure I buy this claim.  The problem of syncronising
multiple geographically seperate servers is tough.  Its actually
easier with challenge-response tokens, since you can simply have
servers issue different challenges when they lose contact.  (Mudge has
a clever similar hack for the current version of securids.)

	No, I (possibly unlike anonymous) want lots of people to make
shitloads of money of strong crypto.  I intend to do so.  But strong
crypto is published crypto, not trade secrets.  SDTI should be in the
business of selling the best code and most sturdy cards to work with
their protocols, which should be publically open to review.  I can't
confirm my attacks without knowing F2*, and without knowing if the
attacks work, I'm reluctant to publish.  So, I think I'll publish
based on what SDTI has published, which may or may not be correct.  (I
have told Mark Warner and Chris McNeil (?) of SDTI about the attacks,
and will discuss their responses.

	*I'm not the one who asked for F2 to be published.  I have
told many people about my attacks, and its concievable that someone
else found the same things.
