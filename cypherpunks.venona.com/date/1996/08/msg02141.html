Hi all,


I thought I would forward this so those less connected might know of amateur
space technology. With a factor of 5 increase in altitude these folks will
be putting things in LEO. My guess, 3-5 years.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To All Fellow Rocketeers:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         The "OuR" project was launched Friday, August 16th, 1996 at 9:05 PST.
&gt; &gt; All available flight data is still being analyzed so any information
&gt; &gt; presented is preliminary and is provided for the courtesy of all those
&gt; &gt; who have supported the "OuR" team.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         First, the principal members of the "OuR" team are, in alphabetical
&gt; &gt; order, Frank Kosdon, Phil Prior, Paul Robinson, and Jim Rosson.  These
&gt; &gt; dedicated souls spent two years of dedicated research and effort, not
&gt; &gt; to mention tens of thousands of dollars, to build and fly the "OuR"
&gt; &gt; project.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         The R motor is a proprietary engine design with the propellant
&gt; &gt; provided by Frank Kosdon.  It was 10.5" in diameter and contained
&gt; &gt; almost 300 pounds of propellant, including a 21 pound, full diameter
&gt; &gt; delay "cake" for tracking.  It was calculated to burn for 10.5
&gt; &gt; seconds, and provide 285,000 Newtons of total impulse.  Yes, in
&gt; &gt; rocketeer terms an R27,000!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         The airframe was 21 feet long, with a 5 to 1 conical nose.  The gross
&gt; &gt; launch mass was about 700 pounds.  On board was a ten watt video
&gt; &gt; downlink, provided by Jon Dunbar, a Trimble GPS, video overlay and
&gt; &gt; associated electronics, provided by Bob Rau, and various other backup
&gt; &gt; electronics.  Both main and drouge parachutes were provided by Bob
&gt; &gt; Stroud.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         The rocket was launched in almost no winds, pointing a few degrees
&gt; &gt; away from the town of Gerlach, NV for safety reasons.  The rocket flew
&gt; &gt; perfectly straight and the motor functioned flawlessly with a total
&gt; &gt; activity time around 12 to 14 seconds.  The rocket coasted for about
&gt; &gt; 80 seconds, slightly more than calculated, into the ozone layer.  The
&gt; &gt; altitude simulations pointed to an expected altitude of just under
&gt; &gt; 100,000 feet.  With the increased activity time and increased coast
&gt; &gt; time, the altitude most likely exceeded 100,000 feet.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         One highlight of this flight was the video data transmitted back to
&gt; &gt; earth from approximately twenty miles in the sky.  What was seen was a
&gt; &gt; clear outline of the entire Black Rock Dessert and the surrounding
&gt; &gt; terrain, the curvature of the earth, and the great blackness of the
&gt; &gt; space.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         Higher altitudes are accessible by smaller rockets, but the intent of
&gt; &gt; this project was to successfully build and fire a "large" rocket
&gt; &gt; motor.  Previously, only commercial enterprises have had success with
&gt; &gt; motors of over four inches in diameter and the results of last year's
&gt; &gt; BALLS launch support this presumption.  Furthermore, the instruments
&gt; &gt; carried aloft simply would not fit in say a 54mm "altitude optimized"
&gt; &gt; motor.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         Unfortunately, the rocket failed to deploy its recovery systems and
&gt; &gt; accelerated to over Mach 1 and impacted into the sand dunes several
&gt; &gt; miles away.  There was a loud sonic boom heard by all that literally
&gt; &gt; shook the earth.  In fact, instead of the nominal "hole and fin slits"
&gt; &gt; seen in previous impacts, there was a twenty foot diameter area with
&gt; &gt; large chunks of sheared earth as if a high energy charge had been
&gt; &gt; detonated under the ground.  The rocket was not recovered, but several
&gt; &gt; pieces of metal, fiberglass, and burnt Nomex were found indicating the
&gt; &gt; ejection charges did in fact fire.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         As more data is analyzed, and more hard facts are gathered, more
&gt; &gt; information will follow.  Furthermore, the rights to the video are in
&gt; &gt; the negotiation stage with the various film crews present, but do
&gt; &gt; expect a very detailed video from Earl Cagle of Point 39 Productions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;         Once again, the "OuR" Project members wish to express sincere thanks
&gt; &gt; to all those who listened, donated, and gave their support who were
&gt; &gt; not specifically named.  This project would not have flown if were not
&gt; &gt; for the "believers" and the tremendous team spirit.  Only they know
&gt; &gt; the sweat and the number of hours it takes to fly such a rocket.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;                                                         Members of the "OuR" Team
