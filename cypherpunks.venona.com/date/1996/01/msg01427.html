Zimmermann stands to recover a lot if he sues the Telegraph under British
libel laws.

&gt;  
&gt;  The Sunday Telegraph of London printed a story last Sunday about neo-nazis
&gt;  using PGP to encrypt their communications.  The story said that PGP was
&gt;  devised by an American neo-nazi sympathizer.  As the creator of PGP, and
&gt;  a human rights activist, I was outraged by such a defamation from a major
&gt;  newspaper.  I called my lawyer Phil Dubois, who seemed to look forward to
&gt;  having some fun with this newspaper.
&gt;  
&gt;  Not wanting to wait around till the morning, and slow lawyers, I called
&gt;  Robin Gedye, the reporter in Bonn who wrote the story, at 7am Monday morning
&gt;  Bonn time, and woke him up at home.  I introduced myself and told him how I
&gt;  felt about it.  He had never heard of me, the Clipper chip, the
controversies
&gt;  of cryptography, and knew nothing about PGP outside of the couple of
&gt;  sentences in his story that mentioned PGP.  He said it wasn't really so bad,
&gt;  because he didn't specifically identify me by name.  One can imagine the
&gt;  effectiveness of that excuse with me.  I then went into some detail with him
&gt;  to bring him up to speed.  I also called his editor in London, who also had
&gt;  never heard of me or PGP.
&gt;  
&gt;  After some checking, they discovered that the Daily Telegraph, a related
&gt;  newspaper, had run an article about my case just a week before.  They also
&gt;  found about 20 recent articles on me in the UK press.  The editor said that
&gt;  my story "checks out".  It was good to know that they now believed that I
&gt;  was not a neo-nazi after all.
&gt;  
&gt;  Anyway, Mr. Gedye says that the Sunday Telegraph will print a retraction
&gt;  next Sunday.  Not just a little retraction, but a whole article on the
&gt;  subject, written by Mr. Gedye himself.  I'm glad to see that this probably
&gt;  means that he will dig into the subject more, in order to write such an
&gt;  article.
&gt;  
&gt;  I guess this means maybe I'll find some other things to occupy Phil Dubois's
&gt;  time.
