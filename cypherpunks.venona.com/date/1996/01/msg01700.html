&gt;&gt;What I found interesting was the lack of meat behind
&gt;&gt;"Crypto Anarchy is Not Inevitable".  It seemed to boil
&gt;&gt;down to the vacuous "if everyone could just agree that key
&gt;&gt;escrow is a good thing, there would be no problem".
&gt;
&gt;This is the main reason I haven't bothered to rebut her points: there were
&gt;essentially none to rebut.
&gt;
&gt;(There are substantive criticisms of my points that can be made, including
&gt;discussions of what might be done to delay or even head off crypto anarchy
&gt;completely. I had dinner a few nights ago with David Friedman, author of
&gt;"The Machinery of Freedom," and he made some incisive comments about how
&gt;the State might go about heading off this future. I'm glad he's on our
&gt;side, and not the government's.)
&gt;
&gt;Two other reasons I have not sought to rebut her analysis:
&gt;
&gt;First, I doubt many people saw either my original article (available on Bob
&gt;Hettinga's page: <A  HREF="http://thumper.vmeng.com/pub/rah/anarchy.html">http://thumper.vmeng.com/pub/rah/anarchy.html</A>) or
&gt;Denning's reaction article.
&gt;
&gt;Second, I stated my views, she stated her views, not much more to say.
&gt;Especially as she has not had an active presence on the Net, either in
&gt;talk.politics.crypto or in other forums I have seen, and thus a real debate
&gt;on the Net has not been possible.
&gt;
&gt;Mostly I know I can't change her views, so why bother? Other people may
&gt;have their views affected by what I say, and for these people I have
&gt;certainly written enough.


Tim, trust me on this one.  Dorothy Denning doesn't have a PRAYER.  You 
already believe it, but I _KNOW_ it!

Something is going to happen.  Something...wonderful!


(BTW, the above few lines, which looks like a canned signature, is not.
Careful readers will note that I keep typing it in, which means that it
isn't identical every time.  This should be a clue to all you lurkers out
there that I MEAN this; it's not just an idle macro.

(It also means that I'm going to have to RTFM on my Eudora to do automatic
signatures, but that's an ENTIRELY different story.)
