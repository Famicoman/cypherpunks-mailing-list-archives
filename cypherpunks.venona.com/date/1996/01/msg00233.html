In article &lt;9512311818.AA16259@all.net&gt;, fc@all.net (Fred Cohen) says:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regarding Fred Cohen, PhD:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cohen's haughty and bombastic style do nothing good for his reputation.  I
&gt;&gt; assume he advertises his PhD to highlight his early accomplishments; he has
&gt;&gt; done little since.
&gt;

Anyone that has earned a PhD has EARNED the right to follow his/her name
with that distinction.  Power to him.  It's an accomplishment that we should
all strive for if we're so inclined.  Dr Cohen: I respect your degree and it
doesn't bother me one bit for you to  use the title that you deserve.

&gt;Apparently you have a reading disability.  I haven't used Ph.D. next to my
&gt;name on this forum for some time.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Let's also consider the granting institution, a second-rank school.

Let's consider the cretin that considers USC a "second rank school."

&gt;
&gt;When you insult me, that's one thing, but insulting my school is
&gt;something quite different.  The University of Southern California is one
&gt;of the finest educational institutions in the world, and is widely
&gt;recognized as such.  The engineering school at USC (from which I earned
&gt;my Ph.D.) is commonly ranked in the top 10 in the US, and in the year
&gt;that I graduated, my department was ranked in the top 5 in the US.
&gt;
&gt;USC, in addition to having a fine athletic tradition, also has many
&gt;unique benefits that sets it apart from many other excellent schools. 
&gt;But I wouldn't want to advertise in this forum - you'll have to contact
&gt;them directly for more extensive information.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cohen's thesis broke new ground, but how many people have read it, or any of
&gt;&gt; his writings, or know anything about his ideas beyond a single word?  How far
&gt;&gt; did he carry this work?  Where are the conference and journal papers?  Cohen's
&gt;&gt; reputation faded into obscurity long ago.  Now he is building a new reputation
&gt;&gt; as a pig-headed loudmouth, threatening his "defamers."  Shades of Sternlight.



And what, may I ask, have YOU written?


&gt;Some people are ignorant because they haven't had a chance to learn, but
&gt;other people are ignorant because they choose to be.  In your case, it is
&gt;apparently the latter.  But I will answer your questions nonetheless:
&gt;
&gt;How many people have read it, or any of his writings, or know anything
&gt;about his ideas beyond a single word?
&gt;
&gt;        The thesis has only sold a few hundred copies, however, over
&gt;        20,000 people have read my books on the subject.  My two
&gt;        articles in "The Sciences" reached about 25,000 people each.
&gt;        But I don't think thatr the value of peoples' work is a
&gt;        function of how many people know about them.
&gt;
&gt;How far did he carry this work?
&gt;
&gt;        I have published over 30 refereed journal articles on the subject,
&gt;        about 50 conference papers, about 100 invited talks, and today,
&gt;        over 1/2 of all computers in the world run virus defense software
&gt;        using techniques I first published.  That's more refereed papers
&gt;        than anyone else in the world on that particular subject.
&gt;
&gt;Where are the conference and journal papers?
&gt;
&gt;        They are listed on the Web site listed below.  They include
&gt;        IEEE, ACM, and IFIP papers, invited papers at IEEE, ACM,
&gt;        DPMA, IFIP, and NIST conferences (as well as many others).
&gt;
&gt;So, now that we have a very brief history of my work, let us all know
&gt;where you went to school, how many journal and conference papers you
&gt;have published, how many books you have written.
&gt;
&gt;We already know that you won't tell people your name because you are
&gt;afraid to have it associated with you personally, but maybe you can help
&gt;us all understand how expert you are and what you have contributed to
&gt;the world so we can appreciate your point of view.

I really don't understand this guys' hostility toward Dr Cohen.  But...
it just doesn't matter.  To hell with him.
