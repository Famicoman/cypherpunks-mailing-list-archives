&gt; It was not a trap. Shimomura was caught with his proverbials down. His
&gt; arrogance made him complacent and as such he didnt take the most basic
&gt; steps to keep the attack out.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Tsutomo's own account of the incident he was only able to
&gt; decipher what happened because the attacker(s) didnt clean away the info
&gt; off the hard drive when they were finished. They rm'd sure but he dd'd
&gt; the raw disk to another drive and worked through the blocks until he
&gt; found the two tools that were used to effect the intrusion. He was also
&gt; able to recover the tcpdump logs that were erased.
&gt; 
&gt; If the intruder(s) had rm'd the data and THEN done a mkfile that filled the
&gt; disk with 0's then most of what we know today would not be available.
&gt; As mentioned a week or two back, filling the unused portions of blocks with
&gt; 0's would probably also be necessary.

Yes but the the attacker would have been a malicous one wouldnt he?

&gt; As to wether Mitnik is capable of effecting the intrusion, that is yet to
&gt; be ascertained. He claims no involvement in it and based on whats known of
&gt; his cracking prowess there is a certain truth to it. He's infinitely better
&gt; with a phone than a keyboard.
&gt; 

And hes not the one that made the phonecalls either.
BTW,I'am I the only one bother to see my tax dollars being wasted
my scsd.edu hosting www.takedown.com a commercial venture?
Iam sure T&amp;M have ebough money after book and movie deals to pay
for their net access.
