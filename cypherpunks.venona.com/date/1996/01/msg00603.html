&gt;Very true. But why does it always seem to take an exploitable crack before
&gt;companies pay attention to security flaws? Is it because they are unable to
&gt;admit that they have made a mistake? Everybody makes mistakes. What's the
&gt;big deal? I really don't understand it. Any psychologists on this list?

I'm not a psychologist, though I doubt that would help. (Having had a
girlfriend who was one, she had no special knowledge about corporate
motivations...)

Companies are pyramids, with a flood of signals flowing up and down the
pyramid. Few of the signals are truly important, most are just noise. Hence
the difficulty with corporations responding to crises.

When a confirmation of a serious problem is made--a building collapses, a
floating point bug is found in a chip, a random number generator is found
to be flawed, etc.--then there is little doubt that a real problem exists,
or at least that a public relations problem must be dealt with. Therefore,
a flurry of corporate activity ensues, task forces are created, press
releases issued, etc.

I'm neither surprised nor disheartened by this. It often takes hitting a
company over the head with a two-by-four..."to get their attention."

(I saw this many times at Intel, and they were ahead of most of their
rivals in spotting problems early on. The "Pentium debacle" is a perfect
example of what Lucky is decrying, as internal memos on the problem had
been basically pooh-poohed and ignored, until a major public relations
disaster hit.)

And this has always been a major role of extra-corporate agents: safety
inspectors, insurance companies, independent testing laboratories, and so
on. The in-house testing departments are frequently inclined to overstate
concerns (known universally as "CYA," for "cover your ass"), so it is not
surprising that their concerns are often treated as a non-urgent matter.
Until a crisis happens, then they are lambasted for not having spoken up
more loudly and more forcefully.

This was true in ancient Sumeria, in the early factories in Europe, on the
communes in China, and in the high-tech labs of today. An easily
understandable mixture of psychology, systems analysis, group dynamics,
economics, and evolutionary game theory.

The Cypherpunks group is, to some extent, helping in this process by trying
to break or cripple new software. (As several of us have noted, the NSA's
second official role, that of securing commercial cryptography, COMSEC,
seems to have been ignored. We are thus left to fill in for these
slackers.)
