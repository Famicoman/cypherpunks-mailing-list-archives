&gt;I thought you might find this interesting...

        Thanks, that is very cool beyond just ecommerce, because what does
it mean for personal encryption?  If I buy one of these doo-hickeys for
$100, and so do you, does that mean we don't have to buy an AT&amp;T 3600
(secure phone) to talk securely, and also not have to worry about Clipper
crap?  Or (as it probably is) does that mean we _have_ to talk through this
company and it only sends tiny bits of info from the card reader... (it'd be
cool if you could modify it...)
        Interesting.

&gt;New security device may broaden business on the web
&gt;
&gt;January 16, 1996
&gt;Web posted at: 9:30 p.m EST (1430 GMT)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From Correspondent Marsha Walton
&gt;
&gt;ATLANTA (CNN) -- For cyberspace marketers, The World Wide Web is a potential
&gt;world wide mall, an electronic marketplace for consumer goods and services. 
&gt;
&gt;  But for now, most visitors are window-shopping, not buying. A new survey by
&gt;the University of Michigan shows consumers are wary of purchasing goods
&gt;online for fear their credit card numbers will be misappropriated.
&gt;
&gt;  People who think nothing of giving their credit card number to an anonymous
&gt;voice over the phone or handing their card to a waitress at a restaurant,
&gt;flinch at the thought of putting that number into a computer. 
&gt;
&gt;  But a New Jersey, ISED Corp., has created a device that
&gt;secures transactions, both on the Internet and over the telephone. It's
&gt;called SED, or secure encryption
&gt;device. It costs about a hundred dollars, attaches to a
&gt;phone or a PC and operates with the swipe of either a credit or ATM card. 
&gt;
&gt;  "What the device will really allow is consumers a new form
&gt;of payment from home using their ATM card. They'll be able to purchase goods
&gt;and services or whatever on the internet, " said Roger Payne, an engineer
&gt;for BT Labs which is testing the product.
&gt;
&gt;  Potentially vulnerable personal account information is
&gt;scrambled or encrypted on the magnetic stripe on the card. It is
&gt;electronically transferred through the hardware. That eliminates the need 
&gt;to say or "key in" the account number or expiration date. 
&gt;
&gt;  "So that if somebody who is not supposed to be looking at it, they can't
&gt;understand what's in there," said Grant Helmendach whose company BUYPASS
&gt;processes three quarters of a billion financial transactions a year. 
&gt;
&gt;   BUYPASS is marketing SED to "mom and pop" retailers which charge goods by
&gt;making an imprint of credit cards, relying on paper transactions that are
&gt;costlier, and less secure.
&gt;
&gt;   "Lots of folks want to focus on the Walmarts of the world. not a lot of
&gt;people have focused on the smaller specialty shops, specialty retailers, and
&gt;what folks at SED have done, is built a terminal that's very inexpensive, 
&gt;so they can play in this game. They have financial incentive to do that," 
&gt;said Helmendach.
&gt;
&gt;   As buying by computer catches on, the device could eventually be used to pay
&gt;for everything from a pizza delivery to bailing a friend out of jail, and
&gt;would be as much a part of the home computer as a floppy disk or a hard drive. 
&gt;
&gt;   And just as consumers have grown accustomed to computers and ATM cards, the
&gt;combination of the two could be another step toward a "cashless" society.
