DEC had a booth at RSADSC last week. I chatted with the reps. there during my
sticker collection tour. They had run out of brochures for the tunnel
product when I arrived, but I was directed to a web site that features some
demo kits and a public tunnelling server using their product. I haven't really
looked at it yet, so I don't have an opinion to offer.
