Adam Shostack &lt;adam@lighthouse.homeport.org&gt; said:

AS&gt; The Wiesenthal center is very influential in Jewish circles.
AS&gt; Attacking them directly would probably be a bad idea, and create bad
AS&gt; associations for anonymity amongst Jews.  (I'll come back to this.)

AS&gt; As always, the best answer to bad speech is more speech.  Ken McVay,
AS&gt; and his Nizkor project, (<A  HREF="http://nizkor.almanac.bc.ca">http://nizkor.almanac.bc.ca</A>) have been
AS&gt; involved in fighting hate speech, holocaust revisionism, and the
AS&gt; like for long time through archiving the big lies that revisionists
AS&gt; pump out, documenting the bogosity of their footnotes, showing their
AS&gt; contradictions, etc.  Pointing out this, and other net resources
AS&gt; fighting anti-semitism is a much cleaner approach than attacking the
AS&gt; Wiesenthal center.

	Isn't this attacking, or at least opposing, them directly?

AS&gt; Someone noted the police stopping skinheads in Oregon-- I'll point
AS&gt; out that there is a substantial difference between talking and
AS&gt; randomly beating the crap out of people.  The later is a fair basis
AS&gt; for action by police, although we may choose to question their
AS&gt; methodology.  There is also a difference between stopping skinheads
AS&gt; and stopping blacks, in that the skinheads decided to wear clothing
AS&gt; and tattoos that identify them as skinheads, and thus may more
AS&gt; fairly be asked to bear the consequences.

	This is known as the "[S]he asked for it" argument, a widely
discredited defense.  If their _behavior_ doesn't indicate criminal
behavior, and there isn't a report of a crime with suspects meeting
their descriptions, there is no more excuse for hassling them than there
is for hassling blacks, or hispanics, or....  Who knows, they could
actually be a bunch of Marines (depending on the area).

AS&gt; Another approach might be to talk about the concept of identity, and
AS&gt; how dangerous mandating identity cards and papers can be.  Jews in
AS&gt; Germany were tracked down via phone records, bank records,
AS&gt; membership lists of organizations (a lesson probably noted by the
AS&gt; NAACP in refusing to give Alabama its membership rolls, leading to a
AS&gt; supreme court case upholding the right of anonymous association.)

	And more recently used in Texas by the KKK, represented by a
black (given the organization defended, I think that the race of the
attorney is relevant) attorney from the ACLU.  The attorney was
subsequently removed as the counsel for the Texas chapter of the NAACP.
