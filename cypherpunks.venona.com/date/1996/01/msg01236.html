        Here is a press release from Mykotronix about a big
order of Fortezza cards for the Defense Messaging System.
        Another part of the government has selected Fisher
International to supply SmartDisk cryptographic cards for
the use of citizens interacting with the IRS and other agencies
electronically.  Although Fisher has not received a big order
yet, they are looking at 100 thousand and 10 million card
production runs.  The Fisher card is based on RSA's crypto
toolkit and DOES NOT include skipjack or escrow.

Subject: Mykotronx sells 68,000 Fortezza cards for Defense Msg System

    IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 1996--Rainbow  Technologies
Inc. (NASDAQ:RNBO), Monday announced its Mykotronx  division has received a 
purchase order from Spyrus for over 68,000  of Mykotronx's new Capstone 
encryption processor (MYK-82). 

    The devices will be used to build part of the Government's order  of
Fortezza Cryptographic Cards for the Defense Message System (DMS)  awarded 
Sept. 1995.  Initial delivery of the new cryptographic  processor will begin 
April 1996. 

    "The significance of the MYK-82 is that it allows us to provide  a high
grade, low cost encryption technology to customers, such as  Spyrus," said 
John Droge, vice president of program development for  Mykotronx.  "The 
MYK-82 is an advanced encryption processor  specifically aimed at PCMCIA 
cryptographic applications and has a  built-in PCMCIA interface.  The newer 
design is smaller, faster and  has a lower cost than its predecessor."  In 
addition, Mykotronx will  be programming all the cryptographic processors to 
fill the  Government's Sept. 1995 order of 300,000 Fortezza Cryptographic
 Cards. 

    The MYK-82, developed by Mykotronx and fabricated by VLSI  Technology
Inc., is the first of a series of security products to be  developed as part 
of an alliance with VLSI, targeting both  Government and commercial markets. 

    Rainbow Technologies, founded in 1984, is the world's leading  developer,
manufacturer and supplier of software protection products  and encryption 
technology.  Mykotronx, a subsidiary of Rainbow, is a  leader in secure 
communication and cryptographic products for U.S.  government agencies and 
the commercial marketplace.  Rainbow was  recently recognized by Forbes 
magazine as one of The Best Small  Companies in America and in SmartMoney 
Magazine as one of the Seven  Stocks for the Next Decade.  Rainbow is ISO 
9002 certified.
