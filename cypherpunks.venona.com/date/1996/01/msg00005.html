&gt;     A Symbol for Information Freedom

&gt;     by Peter Tupper &lt;ptupper@direct.ca&gt;

&gt;     1996 is off to a discouraging start when it comes to the
&gt;future of information freedom.  The American Congress seems
&gt;determined to impose censorship on the Internet.  The legal
&gt;status of strong dual-key cryptography is still in debate. 
&gt;Telephone companies, cable TV services and publishing services
&gt;are all eagerly trying to seize control of the Internet and
&gt;eliminate the many-to-many nature of the medium.  The accidental
&gt;wonder that is the Internet seems to be threatened on all sides,
&gt;in danger of being destroyed or denatured before reaching its
&gt;potential. 

&gt;     My proposal is only a small contribution to the solutions to
&gt;this problem.  I believe a symbol is needed; a simple yet
&gt;recognizable item that will communicate to others that you are:
&gt;     -for freedom of speech and expression in all realms,
&gt;particularly via computer mediated communications.
&gt;     -against the imposition of arbitrary community standards by
&gt;centralized authority on communications.
&gt;     -for making access to communications available to everyone.
&gt;     -against the violation of individual privacy by wiretapping,
&gt;intercepting computer communications, compiling dossiers by
&gt;government or commercial organizations or other forms of
&gt;surveillance.
&gt;     -for making strong, dual-key encryption programs without
&gt;back-doors available to the public.
&gt;     -against building surveillance measures into communications
&gt;and financial infrastructures.  
&gt;     -for a future of communications that is by, for and of the
&gt;people, not the state or the market.

&gt;     The symbol I have chosen is the paper clip.  Why a paper
&gt;clip?
&gt;     There are many reasons:

&gt;     Pragmatic:  Paper clips are readily available for
&gt;practically nothing, all over the world.  They can be applied to
&gt;collars, lapels, scarves, pocket edges, suspenders and neck ties
&gt;without damaging them and without risk of the pin breaking the
&gt;skin.  
&gt;     Aesthetic:  The paper clip is a simple, elegant design that
&gt;is easily recognized the world over.  It can be rendered in many
&gt;colors or plated with precious metals.
&gt;     Symbolic:  The paper clip is a simple but effective piece of
&gt;technology.  An individual uses it to bundle together documents
&gt;from disparate sources to create a unified document upon a given
&gt;subject, which may be dismantled and remade for another topic. 
&gt;Furthermore, a paper clip may be bent out of its regular shape
&gt;and used as an improvised tool for any number of purposes.
&gt;     Historic:  During the German occupation of Norway in World
&gt;War II, Norwegians wore paper clips on their collars as a sign of
&gt;solidarity against the invaders.
&gt;     Commercial:  While anybody can obtain a plain paper clip
&gt;with little trouble, funds for Information Freedom can be raised
&gt;by marketing electroplated or designer paper clips.  

&gt;     The cause of awareness of and activism about AIDS had a
&gt;simple, readily recognized symbol, the folded red ribbon.  Just
&gt;as every celebrity who wears a red ribbon, no matter how trite
&gt;and self-promoting it is, is a reminder to those watching that
&gt;AIDS is happening and that many people are concerned,
&gt;celebrities appearing at the Academy Awards or Grammies with a
&gt;designer, gold-plated paper clip on their outfit reminds the
&gt;world that information freedom is under fire and that people are
&gt;concerned.  It will make the Internet community a visible reality
&gt;in the public sphere.  It will bring these issues into the public
&gt;eyes, and give those involved a rallying symbol.  It will make a
&gt;small difference, but it will contribute to the greater good.

&gt;     

Advertising couldn't hurt.
