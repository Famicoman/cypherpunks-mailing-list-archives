Seen on Alt.best.of.internet. Would love to find out if this is 
true!

&gt; &gt;Original Subject: support call - urban legand or fact?
&gt; &gt;            Date: 27 Jul 1995 16:44:18 -0700
&gt; &gt;... (many forwards deleted)...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;This falls into the "Why did it have to happen on *MY* shift?" category.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;A friend of mine is a chief engineer at SuperMac, and he related this
&gt; &gt;story to me.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;SuperMac records a certain number of technical support calls at random,
&gt; &gt;to keep tabs on customer satisfaction.  By wild "luck", they managed to
&gt; &gt;catch the following conversation on tape.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Some poor SuperMac TechSport got a call from some middle level official...
&gt; &gt;from the legitimate government of Trinidad.  The fellow spoke very good
&gt; &gt;English, and fairly calmly described the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It seemed there was a coup attempt in progress at that moment.  However,
&gt; &gt;the national armoury for that city was kept in the same building as the
&gt; &gt;Legislature, and it seems that there was a combination lock on the door
&gt; &gt;to the armoury.  Of the people in the capitol city that day, only the
&gt; &gt;Chief of the Capitol Guard and the Chief Armourer knew the combination to
&gt; &gt;the lock, and they had already been killed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;So, this officer of the government of Trinidad continued, the problem is
&gt; &gt;this.  The combination to the lock is stored in a file on the Macintosh,
&gt; &gt;but the file has been encrypted with the SuperMac product called Sentinel.
&gt; &gt;Was there any chance, he asked, that there was a "back door" to the
&gt; &gt;application, so they could get the combination, open the armoury door,
&gt; &gt;and defend the Capitol Building and the legitimately elected government
&gt; &gt;of Trinidad against the insurgents?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;All the while he is asking this in a very calm voice, there is the sound
&gt; &gt;of gunfire in the background. The Technical Support guy put the person on
&gt; &gt;hold. A phone call to the phone company verified that the origin of the
&gt; &gt;call was in fact Trinidad.  Meanwhile, there was this mad scramble to see
&gt; &gt;if anybody knew of any "back doors" in the Sentinel program.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As it turned out, Sentinel uses DES to encrypt the files, and there was
&gt; &gt;no known back door.  The Tech Support fellow told the customer that aside
&gt; &gt;from trying to guess the password, there was no way through Sentinel, and
&gt; &gt;that they'd be better off trying to physically destroy the lock.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The official was very polite, thanked him for the effort, and hung up.
&gt; &gt;That night, the legitimate government of Trinidad fell.  One of the BBC
&gt; &gt;reporters mentioned that the casualties seemed heaviest in the capitol,
&gt; &gt;where for some reason, there seemed to be little return fire from the
&gt; &gt;government forces.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;O.K., so they shouldn't have kept the combination in so precarious a
&gt; &gt;fashion. But it does place, "I can't see my Microsoft Mail server"
&gt; &gt;complaints in a different sort of perspective, does it not?
