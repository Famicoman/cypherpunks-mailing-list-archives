Dude, while these subject lines are very quaint, given the level of
traffic, I would really appreciate more descriptive subject headings. You
may use any official UN language that can be written in 8-bit characters.

&gt; European Commission Moves To Stamp Out Racism On Internet
&gt;      
&gt; Burssels, 31 Jan 1996 -- The European Commission (EC) has
&gt; formed a pan-European group to "encourage the mixing of
&gt; people of different cultures" from both inside and
&gt; outside Europe.  

I knew Euro-Disneyland was going to catch on some time.
 
&gt; According to EC officials, the first task of the
&gt; Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRAX),

Geez, so that wasn't a joke.

&gt; as it is called, will be to investigate and, using legal
&gt; means, stamp out the current wave of racism on the
&gt; Internet.  

OK, then maybe it is a joke.
 
&gt; In a prepared statement, CRAX said that it hopes that the
&gt; EC "will take all needed measures to prevent the Internet
&gt; from becoming a vehicle for the incitement of racist
&gt; hatred."  

Prevent? How about "Band-Aid?"

Recall that in many cases, Band-Aids actually promote infection by 
providing a dark, humid place for growth.
 
&gt; As reported previously, the "Thule Network" first came 
&gt; to the public's attention when the January, 1994, issue
&gt; of Chip magazine (a popular computer monthly in Germany)
&gt; claimed to have unearthed eight Thule BBSs.  
&gt; 
&gt; According to Chip magazine at the time, "The (Thule)
&gt; network distributes information on demonstrations and
&gt; invitations to meetings, addresses for contacting parties
&gt; and groups, and it reviews and offers books and
&gt; magazines. One of the mail-boxes contained instructions
&gt; for producing military explosives and letter bombs. A
&gt; great deal of space is taken up by 'political
&gt; discussions' among the users."

Um, OK. So force these people above ground, and they will need to 
restrict their activities to political discussions.

&gt; Thule is Norse or Viking terminology for "top of the
&gt; world." The Thule Network's name actually derives from
&gt; the small, elitist 1920s movement which was considered to
&gt; be the Nazi vanguard.

Read: a bunch of stupid thugs who don't want to be seen in daylight.

&gt; Thule movement leaders included
&gt; Rudolf Hess. Some BBSs on the Thule network have names
&gt; such as "Wolf Box" and "Resistance," while many Internet
&gt; messages are signed by people calling themselves "The
&gt; Wolf," among other names.

What's the matter? Their mothers didn't like them or something? Just try 
holding a debate with a person with a handle like that. The audience 
would just crack up.
