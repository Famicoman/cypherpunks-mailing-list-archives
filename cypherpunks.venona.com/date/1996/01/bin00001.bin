I would feel a bit more comfortable if violations by non-anonymous entities
were well publicized. Otherwise, we may force the TLAs to cash in the
"weapons export" card against the anonymizers, and hasten a crackdown on
them. (In this particular instance, the remailer resides outside the ITAR
zone, but that detail could be conveniently ignored in calling for a ban on
U.S. remailers.)  

I'm still hoping for a test of the PA anonymity prohibition....
