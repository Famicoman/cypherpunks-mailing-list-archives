&gt; &gt;Person X commits treasonable act A.  All of the persons who are signed on to
&gt; &gt;his key could be considered to be co-conspirators.  The same applies to
&gt; &gt;nyms.  The difficulty with prosecuting nyms is finding the link to the real
&gt; &gt;world individual.  Anyone associated with him/her/it will be considered to
&gt; &gt;be guilty by reason of key signage or a way of determining who the real
&gt; &gt;person is...
&gt; ....
&gt; &gt;I guess we are stuck with the "Web of Guilt"...
&gt; 
&gt; Although I disagree with many things the U.S. government has declared
&gt; unlawful, and think we are on the wrong track in many ways, I don't see any
&gt; evidence for a "web of guilt."
&gt; 
&gt; I could have signed the keys of Timothy McVeigh, O.J. Simpson, and Hilary
&gt; Clinton, and yet this would not cause any prosecutor to indict me, per se.
&gt; (Brian Davis, do you disagree?) Obviously if one of these persons I was
&gt; known to have associated with, to the point of signing their keys, were
&gt; under investigation, then some detectives might follow up some leads to
&gt; find out who I was. This is ordinary detective work, not guilt by
&gt; association.

I agree.  Signing the key might get you a visit from an agent with 
questions about your relationship with whoever, but you would not (at 
least to me) become a target of the investigation without a **whole lot** 
more than a mere key signing.

Speaking only for myself (as always).

&gt; 
&gt; Key-signing is overrated, in my view. It is just an affidavit from someone
&gt; that they think a person is related to a key. I've signed a few keys (not
&gt; many, and don't ask me to!), and I've never once asked for any form of
&gt; state-sanctioned ID.
