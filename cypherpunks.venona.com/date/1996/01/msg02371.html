&gt;&gt; 2)  I would like to see a program like private Idaho have the ability to send

&gt;
&gt;This is very easy, at least in Unix: pgp -kvv, grep, cut, for.
&gt;
&gt;In DOS, you can do pgp -kvv and find, then edlin to change
&gt;every "sig" into "call getkey", call the resulting (batch) file,
&gt;which will call GETKEY.BAT for every missing key. I hope.

This is about what I do now.  I am writing a perl program that splits the
requests up into seperate mail messages and dumps them out to the mail
program dujour.

&gt;However, I don't see much of a point to it: these are people you don't
&gt;even know the keys of; how are you going to know whether they are
&gt;trustworthy? (The Web-o-Trust can only tell you who they are, not
&gt;whether to trust them.)

True, but I hate seeing keys with 40 signatures on it and all of them read
"Unknown Signator".  (I am expecting someone to use "Unknown Signator" or
"Key revoked" as a nym any day now.)

&gt;...
&gt;&gt; This would
&gt;&gt; have the interesting effect of building a more complete keyring, while using 
&gt;&gt; the "web of trust" to weed out alot of the bogus keys that tend to crop up on
&gt;&gt; the key servers.  After n number of itenerations you would have more of the
&gt;&gt; "important keys" and the ones that have little or no signage would be left to
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;No, you wouldn't. You would tend to have the keys that sign a lot
&gt;of other keys, which would include both SLED (Four-11) and a lot
&gt;of careless people that sign every key in sight.

Very good point!  I was actually talking about the "incredibly bogus keys
that stopped living and take up valuable keyserver space".  Keys with names
like "Wow! This is neat! I think I will create 3-4 keys a day!!!!!".  (I
actually wound up retrieving a key like this.  They are pretty annoying...)

&gt;How about, instead:
&gt;
&gt;3) A way to retrieve all the keys signed by a given entity.
&gt;
&gt;This would have the effect that when you come to trust Alice, you
&gt;can simply go and get all the keys she signed. I believe the present
&gt;keyservers don't allow that... (Or else I don't know how to ask for it.)

I like that idea alot!  That way you can retrieve keys signed by people you
trust.  (Would this be the "Web of Guilt by Association"?)  It might have a
downside or two...  (Privacy for key signers?  Job seekers denied a job
because they signed the key of a known member of the four horsemen? "Are you
or have you ever been a key signer for Tim May or one of his Tentacles?")
