&gt;&gt; On the other hand, this would be an EXCELLENT "argument" to bring in front
&gt;&gt; of a Congressional committee considering the adoption of any V-chip type

&gt;&gt; diametrically opposite reasons of their reason for having it in the first
&gt;&gt; place, they'll try to modify their proposal to prevent this.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If we're lucky, this'll have the effect of killing the whole concept of
&gt;&gt; government-sponsored (required?) V-chip-type technology.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; OTOH, I agree with other posters who think that truly voluntary content
&gt;&gt; selection would be an excellent addition to television:  In effect, an
&gt;&gt; automatic, programmable TV-Guide search engine.
&gt;
&gt;While it's hard to find a general theme here, I think I disagree. 

What?  You mean you LIKE to read TV guide every week, cover to cover, in 
advance, to scedule your TV viewing habits?

&gt;Anyway, 
&gt;I don't think that even truly voluntary content selection is a good idea, 
&gt;because it reduces art to numbers, which is wrong.

Aw, admit it.  You're just still pissed 'cause I called  you a f------ 
statist.  &lt;G&gt;&gt;

Me, I'd like to be able to tell my "TV-Guide search engine" to:

1.   Look for this particular show or movie.
2.   Look for this particular star, director, or other participant..
3.   Follow a subject thread, say on the news.
4.   etc.

Maybe even a more complex (artificially intelligent) agent that "knows" me 
well enough to anticipate my desires.


&gt; lead to a balkanization that diminishes the common
&gt;culture. I think it was good the way network TV was limited to the lowest
&gt;common denominator, but with variety. People who wanted something with a
&gt;little more flavor than WonderBread [tm] were able to find it, but they
&gt;did have to look, which often involved *meeting other people* with common
&gt;interests, and they still tuned in to Ed Sullivan to see what the Joneses
&gt;were watching. Give people 1024 bits' worth of channels to choose from,
&gt;classified by arbitrary criteria involving no human contact, and you get
&gt;something entirely different. I'm not sure what's happening now, but I
&gt;don't think I like it. 

You're entitled to NOT like it.  But I'm equally entitled to use modern 
technology to sift through 60+ cable channels, or 300+ DSS-type channels.
