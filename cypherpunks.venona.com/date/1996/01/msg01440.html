	The first is nice, given the vulnerability of international services
to pressure from one country. The second could be a problem. The third shows,
like the ITAR, that sometimes one government department can have a lot more
sense than the others. Possibly Commerce is benefiting from private sector
contacts?

Edupage, 18 January 1996.  Edupage, a summary of news items on information
technology, is provided three times each week as a service by Educom,
a Washington, D.C.-based consortium of leading colleges and universities
seeking to transform education through the use of information technology.

EXODUS FROM COMMERCIAL SERVICES?
Commercial online services are having a difficult time keeping customers and
differentiating themselves, as more savvy computer users switch over to
small Internet access providers.  "Most everything I find on the online
services, I can find using an Internet service provider," says one customer
who's made the switch.  "For me, the need for an online service is
diminishing."  "AOL is like the Internet on training wheels," says another,
who feels he's "graduated."  In tandem with subscriber defection is the
problem of content providers who increasingly are setting up their own shops
on the Web, bypassing the commercial services altogether.  The popularity of
the Web "turns the model of the online services industry upside down," says
Scott Kurnit, the former No. 2 executive at Prodigy, who's now running an
Internet service for MCI and News Corp.  While the number of commercial
service subscribers has grown to about 12.5 million over the past decade
(doubling in the past year), the number of World Wide Web users increased
eight-fold, to eight-million, in just the past year, according to
International Data Corp.  (Wall Street Journal 18 Jan 96 A6)

ONE IS ENOUGH
The number of people subscribing to more than one online service has dropped
significantly since 1991 when almost a third of online users carried
multiple subscriptions.  Now, 97% report they can do everything they need to
using a single service.  (Business Week 22 Jan 96 p8)

CROSS-BORDER CULTURE WAR LOOMS
Canada's federal regulator is in Washington trying to persuade a skeptical
U.S. government that Canadian efforts to black out American TV signals that
contravene standards on violence and nudity do not violate NAFTA.  U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has warned Canadian Trade Minister Roy
MacLaren that the U.S. government, while supporting the development of a
V-chip to allow parental control, will react negatively if Ottawa takes
wholesale action to block American programming from distribution through
Canadian cable systems.  (Toronto Financial Post 18 Jan 96 p5)  Meanwhile,
Power DirecTV says the explosive growth of satellite TV piracy and the flood
of American direct-to-home dishes into Canada is threatening to wipe out
Canadian broadcasting.  The company urged the Canadian government to create
rules that aid new Canadian DTH companies and to enforce laws that prohibit
the import of American dishes into Canada. (Toronto Star 17 Jan 96 B3)
