&gt; &gt; The other problem (tying the nym to RealName) for employers is
&gt; &gt; more severe.  A nym is only good when no one can tie it to your
&gt; &gt; real name.  If I have to tell everyone I do work for what my real
&gt; &gt; name and nym is, soon enough people will be able to tie the two that
&gt; &gt; the nym becomes nearly useless.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Lucky would be willing to share some wisdom from his experiences
&gt; consulting for various companies. (I don't know how much his reputation as
&gt; "Lucky Green" has come into play in securing those contracts, and of
&gt; course perhaps he really is an Irishman whose parents (the Greens) named
&gt; him "Lucky"....)

[..]

&gt; &gt;I'm still not sure whether it makes sense to have "reputation capital"
&gt; denominated in an actual currency that can be traded, for the above reason.
&gt; We might use something like a nym-independent(*) credential statement
&gt; signed by a certifier and encrypted to the subject of the credential.
&gt; Pseudonyms and verinyms belonging to various persons/agents/etc. could
&gt; freely swap around these "rep rupees" with potentially very confusing results.
&gt; 
&gt; Since credentials need to be backed up by actual performance when it comes to
&gt; a job, such a system might actually be acceptable. I could buy a lion taming
&gt; credential with some e$, but everyone would realize that I wouldn't last long
&gt; on the job if it didn't describe me fairly accurately. ;)  Presumably a
&gt; trustable-with-enormous-sums-of-cash credential would command quite a high
&gt; price on the open market.


This is all well and good, but highly theoretical.  It might
happen someday, but right now reputations don't work that way.
If I gave a reputation certificate to a prospective client
they'd just look at it and say "huh?".

Some groups do indeed deal well with nym's reputations.  If Emmanuel
Goldstein shows up at a hacker's convention, everyone knows who
he is and what he's done.

Alas, most regular businessmen don't want to deal with someone named
"Agent Steal"[*], at least not to the point of signing checks to him.

Perhaps a partial solution is to pick a nym that sounds like a real
name, like "Tim May" or "Jeff Weinstein".  There's still a problem
of proving that I am the same "Tim Weinstein" that the prospective
client has exchanged email with.  But to be honest, they don't know
if I'm the same "Eric Murray" they have been emailing either...



*- to pick a random hacker's nym.
