&gt; &gt; Note that the problem here is in the basic trust model, not just the
&gt; &gt; certificate distribution model (which is a separate problem).  The lack of
&gt; &gt; ability for a certifier to revoke his own certification, plus the lack of a
&gt; &gt; facility to put limits on the duration and meaning of the certification,
&gt; &gt; make PGP certificates of very limited practical value.
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't the last bit here, the part about duration and meaning, the 
&gt; practical answer to the problem?  Especially duration?
&gt; 
&gt; The stuff that's been going on lately with Netscape's browsers, Sameer's
&gt; apache ssl server, and the difficulty of getting CAs like verisign to
&gt; approve keys underscores the importance of this issue.
&gt; 
&gt; This is probably sort of half-baked, but is it possible to come up with a 
&gt; formal grammar that would allow us to describe trust models in general?  
&gt; What if we had a prolog-like system that allowed you to set up rules like:
&gt; 
&gt; "x is a student if x has got a signature from a school" 
&gt; "x is a school if x has got a signature from the accredation authority"
&gt; "x belongs to the secret society of x has signatures from 3 other people
&gt; who have belonged to the society for more than a year, and if x is 
&gt; a certified owner of a duck."
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't something like this give us the flexibility to use a PGPish model
&gt; of trust or an X.509ish model, or whatever else we wanted to do?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that the rules that govern when you can accept which 
&gt; signature ought to be data objects in a more flexible system, just as the 
&gt; signatures themselves are data objects.  That means that the rules 
&gt; themselves ought to be subject to change, revokation, or revision.  
&gt; 
&gt; The constitution wouldn't have survived if it didn't contain a mechanism 
&gt; for ammendment.  Wouldn't a model of trust with the same ability for 
&gt; revision and extension be a lot more robust, and a lot more resistent to 
&gt; centralized control?
&gt; 

Indeed, I agree that's the right approach.  In fact, I agree so much
that I've spent the last few months (with Joan Feigenbaum and Jack
Lacy) developing the principles and structure for just such a "trust
management" system.  Watch this space for details of our system, called
"PolicyMaker", which I expect to release a paper about shortly and a
reference implementation around April or May.
