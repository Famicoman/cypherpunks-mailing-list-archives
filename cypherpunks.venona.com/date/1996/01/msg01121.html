&gt; Lotus-Security - Lotus Announces Compromise for Export of Strong
&gt; Encryption
&gt; 
&gt; By ELIZABETH WEISE
&gt; AP Cyberspace Writer
&gt; 
&gt; SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Lotus Development Corp. announced a
&gt; compromise with the federal government Wednesday that will allow it
&gt; to put better security features into the international version of
&gt; its Notes program.
&gt; 
&gt; While the arrangement assures the government it can access data
&gt; under extreme circumstances, it represents an advance in the
&gt; strength of security allowed in software exported from the United
&gt; States.
&gt; 
&gt; Federal law prohibits the export of certain high-level
&gt; encryption programs, which are defined as a munition under a Cold
&gt; War-era arms control act.
&gt; 
&gt; Encryption programs take ordinary data and put it in secret form
&gt; that cannot be accessed without the proper data ``key.'' The
&gt; government's arbitrary standard for cracking encryption programs
&gt; when needed is at a technical level described as ``40-bit.''
&gt; 
&gt; Some software programs sold in the United States, including
&gt; Lotus Notes, now use stronger 64-bit encryption. Lotus has been
&gt; under pressure to bring such security to Notes users overseas.
&gt; 
&gt; Although 40-bit encryption is quite strong, highly-sophisticated
&gt; attacks using several computers have been able to break it
&gt; recently.
&gt; 
&gt; ``Our customers have basically lost confidence in 40-bit
&gt; cryptography,'' said Ray Ozzie, president of Iris Associates, the
&gt; unit of Lotus that developed Notes.
&gt; 
&gt; ``That left us in a bind. We are the vendor that's supposedly
&gt; selling a secure system to them and they are saying it's no good,''
&gt; Ozzie told a standing room audience at the RSA Data Security
&gt; conference.
&gt; 
&gt; Changes in the general export laws seemed unlikely so Lotus
&gt; negotiated an interim solution.
&gt; 
&gt; The export version of Lotus Notes 4.0, which went on sale last
&gt; week, includes 64-bit encryption but the company has given the U.S.
&gt; government a special code that unlocks the final 24 bits.
&gt; 
&gt; For companies that use the international version of Notes, it's
&gt; as if Lotus put two strong locks on a door and gave a key for one
&gt; to the U.S. government. Thieves have to get break through two
&gt; locks, the government only one.
&gt; 
&gt; ``This protects corporate information from malicious crackers
&gt; but permits the government to retain their current access,'' Ozzie
&gt; said. He acknowledged the solution was only a compromise and said
&gt; Lotus wants to see better data security methods developed
&gt; worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; However, many participants at the conference saw the move as a
&gt; cosmetic answer to the tension between corporate desires for the
&gt; best security and government's interest to access data when
&gt; necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; ``It's a useful stopgap measure that has no value in the long
&gt; run,'' said Donn Parker, a senior security consultant with SRI
&gt; International, a computer research company in Menlo Park, Calif.
&gt; 
&gt; Simson Garfinkel, author and computer security expert, said he's
&gt; not sure international buyers of Notes will like the solution.
&gt; 
&gt; ``Foreign companies don't want the U.S. government to spy on
&gt; their data any more than the U.S. government wants foreign
&gt; companies to be able to spy on theirs,'' Garfinkel said.
&gt; 
&gt; International Business Machines Corp. bought Lotus in July,
&gt; citing the success of Notes, a sophisticated communications and
&gt; database program.
