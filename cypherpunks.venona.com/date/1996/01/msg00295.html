&gt;&gt; Ed, I've pointed out to you during our mini-flame war that I've been getting
&gt;&gt; 4 copies of your every e-mail: 2 via the cpunks list, 2 directly from your
&gt;&gt; box cc:'d to me. You _know_ that I've been getting 2 copies of cc:'s not
&gt;&gt; passing through toad.com, that the problem is at your end, and not at
&gt;&gt;toad.com,
&gt;&gt; and you should _not_ send test posts to cypherpunks.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is *not* at my end, your ignorance is showing.  If it were,
&gt;then everyone would be getting 2 copies of everything I send, and that's
&gt;simply not true.  Some people are getting two copies, but some are only
&gt;getting one copy.

I have also been getting two copies of most or all of your messages, at
least for the past few weeks (since you became active on the list again, I
think).

I have not been complaining, just deleting the extra copies.

In looking at the detailed headers of a pair of such duplicates I see that
there may have been some kind of "fork" (not a technical term, just a
description) where the two messages (called Blue and Red) differ as
follows:

Blue Message:

Received: from dal1820.computek.net by toad.com id AA01149; Thu, 4 Jan 96
16:49:35 PST
Received: (from erc@localhost) by dal1820.computek.net (8.6.10/8.6.10) id
SAA19801; Thu, 4 Jan 1996 18:49:29 -0600

Red Message:

Received: from dal1820.computek.net by toad.com id AA01148; Thu, 4 Jan 96
16:49:36 PST
Received: (from erc@localhost) by dal1820.computek.net (8.6.10/8.6.10) id
SAA19801; Thu, 4 Jan 1996 18:49:29 -0600

Only a one-second difference, but the difference grows in later headers.
The point is that there were already two slightly difference versions of
the message before toad.com was reached.

Other subtle differences exist, too. For example:

Blue Message:

X-UIDL: 820809984.020

Red Message:

X-UIDL: 820809984.018

I don't even know what X-UIDL is, but this is a notable difference between
the two versions.

I suggest you carefully examine the full headers and go from there. It
appears that toad.com is only sending two messages because it _received_
two messages.
