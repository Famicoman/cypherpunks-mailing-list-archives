&gt;&gt; remain relatively secure.  However, I am I'm not saying that adding
&gt;&gt; firewalling capabilities would make the system invincible.  I *am* 
&gt;&gt; saying that it would provide the system with more security than it 
&gt;&gt; currently has and would help to reduce (not eliminate) some risks 
&gt;&gt; associated with networking.  
&gt;
&gt;But what does it mean to add 'firewalling capabilities' to an O/S?  By 
&gt;definition, a firewall is supposed to stop the spread of 'fire' by being 
&gt;the sole mechanism for the interchange of packets.

Essentially, adding protective mechanisms that would filter incoming 
network connections (incoming to the O/S) rendering potential risky
connections harmless or rejecting them.  Steve Bellovin has a very 
well-written paper called "Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol
Suite" which addresses a number of these.  If memory serves correctly
at this late hour (midnight), then it can be ftp'ed from research.att.com
and it is in the /pub/dist/smb directory (or somewhere around there).



&gt;If you're referring to making a hardened OS that can protect itself 
&gt;through the use of well written code, memory protections, etc. then, yes 
&gt;by all means add it to your OS, but these shouldn't be luxuries in that 
&gt;they're thought of as 'firewalling' features.  Rather these things should 
&gt;be compulsory in the development of OS's.
&gt;

I agree with you 100%.  Eventually, I think the market will demand it and
the vendors will have to begin delivering hardened O/S's.



&gt;&gt; Of course, it would be terrific if the vendors would produce Operating 
&gt;&gt; Systems which are secure AND usable.  (I think the market will eventually 
&gt;&gt; demand this from vendors, but this probably won't happen in the next year 
&gt;&gt; or two.)
&gt;
&gt;Even if OS's could be secure(lets not get into Orange Book here) they 
&gt;would need constant updating.  Most users have problems printing, let 
&gt;alone installing patches and tweaking afterwards to deal with conflicts.  

Good points.  As stated above, the systems should be secure AND usable.


&gt;And you can't expect IS to micromanage the corporation's entire fleet of 
&gt;machines.

True.  However, the systems can be monitored for compliance to Corporate
Security policies and the non-compliant (read insecure) systems can be
quickly brought back into compliance - frequently using automated scripts.

NOTE:  Implementing a high level of Information Security should be as 
user-friendly, as non-intrusive to business operations as possible, and
as cheaply as possible.  (Yes, it is possible to achieve all three objectives).


&gt;This would be nice, and would be a good start, but like I said above, 
&gt;these things shouldn't be considered to be luxuries.  Rather they should 
&gt;be compulsory.  That doesn't mean that they will obsolete firewalls by 
&gt;any stretch of the imagination.

I agree with you 100%

Nice posting, BTW.  (And not just because I agree with you).  8^)

&gt;(I'm starting to think Frank may have been right to move this to
