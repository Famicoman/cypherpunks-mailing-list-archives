&gt;&gt; While this may be based on the "classic" view of the start of the direct

&gt;&gt; that the US KNEW that the Japanese were going to attack, SOMEWHERE and 
&gt;&gt; SOMEWHEN (but not exactly), and in fact WANTED the attack to occur to 
&gt;&gt; justify getting into a war that we "should" have entered.

&gt;&gt;I've read that FDR had a humint source warning of a Japanese strike on 
&gt;&gt;Pearl Harbor. I also recall reading that J Edgar Hoover received a report 
&gt;&gt;of a diplomatic conversation detailing the planned attack, but sat on it.
&gt;
&gt;And this is from a post I sent to the list last summer:
&gt;***************************************************************
&gt;I just read 'Infamy' by John Toland (1982), containing 'proof'
&gt;- very convincing, in my opinion - of the Pearl Harbour cover-up.
&gt;The US president, selected members of his cabinette and a
&gt;few admirals and generals knew - from Magic and the 'winds'
&gt;execute, radio traffic analysis, diplomatic sources, double
&gt;agents - exactly when and where the Japaneese were going to
&gt;attack, but didn't warn Hawaii, fearing that too efficient
&gt;counter-measures by the Oahu military might make the attack
&gt;abort and so not convince the isolationists. The unexpected 
&gt;tactical capabilities of the Japaneese armada then made a
&gt;cover-up all the more important.
&gt;*****************************************************************
&gt;The unfortunate cipher expert Captain Safford spent most of
&gt;his post-war life trying to uphold the honour of his fellow
&gt;cryptanalysts, putting the blame on generals and politicians,
&gt;but in vain.

It's interesting that we even HEARD about Coventry, but of course that was a 
British decision, a civilian target in an attack during an era where there 
were already plenty of attacks on civilian targets, and the British 
UNDERSTOOD why Coventry had to die.  (But I don't know WHEN "we" (the 
general public) first heard about Coventry.  Anybody know?

(For the historically-impaired:  Coventry was/is an English town (small 
city?) perhaps most famous from the Lady Godiva legend...but I digress...    
 British found out, I guess through Ultra, that it was going to be bombed.  
Telling the inhabitants would have saved many lives, but (possibly) alerted 
the Germans that Enigma had been broken.  British made the correct choice:  
Let the city get bombed without (much?) warning.  The value of keeping the 
broken-ness of Ultra a secret far outweighed the value of Coventry.)
