`Computer Within a Floppy Disk` puts secure electronic commerce in the palm of
your hand
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 1996--Fischer International Systems
Corp. (FISC) announced Wednesday the availability of Crypto SmartDisk(tm), the
world's first intelligent security token housed in a floppy disk-sized device.

The announcement was made at the annual conference of RSA Data Security Inc., a
leading encryption algorithm vendor. Addison M. Fischer, founder and chairman of
 FISC and a world-recognized leader in systems and data security, attended the
meeting with fellow experts in cryptography.

Crypto SmartDisk is a self-contained computer, complete with crypto coprocessor,
 memory, real time clock, and resident operating system. It fits in any of the
150 million installed standard 3.5 inch floppy disk drives; no additional
hardware is required.

Crypto SmartDisk supports RSA, DSA and DES algorithms for encryption and digital
 signatures. The RSA public key cryptographic system is the de facto standard
and is commonly used to create digital envelopes for secure electronic commerce.
 DSA is a standard for digital signatures that is endorsed by the U.S.
government, and DES is the most widely used and tested encryption algorithm
available.

`Crypto SmartDisk breaks barriers in the world of secure electronic commerce,`
said Michael S. Battaglia, FISC president and CEO. `It literally puts in any
user's hands the power to use any PC with a 3.5 inch floppy drive as a secure
electronic transaction station. Businesses, government agencies, even private
citizens can use Crypto SmartDisk to engage in secure electronic commerce with
complete confidence that their transactions will be read only by those people
the users intend.`

Crypto SmartDisk is positioned to gain rapid acceptance among agencies of the
U.S. federal government, particularly those that manage civilian applications.
It offers the benefits of hardware-based encryption without the expense of
retrofitting PCs that don't have card readers. By using a Crypto SmartDisk, for
example, private citizens could conduct secure electronic transactions with
agencies like the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), Social Security Administration
(SSA), and IRS from their home computers.

The General Services Administration Security Infrastructure Program Management
Office is planning just such a pilot project, with hundreds to thousands of
participants including private citizens. Using Crypto SmartDisk, participants
may conduct electronic transactions such as requesting SSA benefit information,
inquiring about the availability of federal loans, and potentially even filing
on-line tax returns with the IRS.

Crypto SmartDisk also offers a developer's toolkit so users can create their own
 applications featuring encryption capabilities. The toolkit provides both
software tools and libraries and is fully compliant with the PKCS No. 11
standard and the ISO 7816 standard.

Fischer International Systems Corp. is a leading worldwide supplier of software
solutions for secure Electronic Commerce. Founded in 1982, it is one of the
largest privately held software companies in the United States. Its products
include Watchdog(r) and SmartDisk(tm) for PC data security, TAO(tm) (Totally
Automated Office) for cross-platform, multilingual messaging and office
automation; EDI/comm(tm) for Electronic Data Interchange; and WorkFlow.2000(tm)
for cross-platform automated forms and process management.

Crypto SmartDisk and the Crypto SmartDisk toolkit are available for immediate
shipment. -0-
