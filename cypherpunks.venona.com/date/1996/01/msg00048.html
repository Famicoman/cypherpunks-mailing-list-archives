&gt; &gt;     the concept is interesting... diplomatic immunity is not automatic in 
&gt; &gt; that it implies diplomatic recognition.  does a rogue state enjoy the 
&gt; &gt; privilege of obviously bogus diplomatic passports?  the diplomatic 
&gt; &gt; passport is a "gentleman's agreement" to facilitate trading intelligence 
&gt; &gt; officers --sarcastic maybe, truthful?  been there, done that.
&gt; 
&gt; A Dip Passport does nothing of the kind.

    come on, David. stated and "real" use are often quite different.
    I meant what I said, literally: "...been there, done that."

    it's nice to believe that governments are above board --they never
    have been, and never will be --and Bubba is a prime example.  I
    would buy a used car from Tricky Dick long before I would from Bubba!

    power is not only corruption, it is _deceit_!

    BTW, I do not disagree with your "protocol" in the slightest. PNG,
    and the trading of PNGs has been around ever since the French seemed
    to their language dominate foreign affairs --however, persona non
    gratis is rather explicit.

    and, I still wonder how the host country will treat "bogus" DPs 
    from rogue states if they have more DPs than real citizens. uncle
    has been getting less suble these days....
 
&gt; You are awarded stutus by your placement by the host country, on their
&gt; Diplomatic List. If you are there, fine; otherwise... Now, you'll never
&gt; get on that list without a Dip. Passport &amp; recipricol agreement but it's
&gt; not enough...
&gt; 
&gt; Your name can be removed by the host at any time (PNG'ed) but some kind
&gt; of warning is necessary so you can leave the host country prior to
&gt; expiration of the status. (Not much, however! I recall one case where it
&gt; was _literally_ "Be on the 4pm plane, or else.") If you are out of the
&gt; country already, you won't be back. (One person was, and his cat became
&gt; the ""PNG Pussy"" as she was shipped home the next day.)
&gt; 
&gt; The Dip List being out-of-date caused considerable embarrassment to the
&gt; US during our invasion of Panama. Marines raided the Nicaraguan
&gt; Ambassador's Residence because the out-of-date copy at the US Mission
&gt; showed the _old_ address.
