&gt;&gt;Up until recently (18-30 months ago) NSA employees were only allowed
&gt;&gt;to identify themselves as employees of DoD.  It was common knowledge,
&gt;&gt;that unspecific references to Fort Meade meant NSA; and if you saw
&gt;&gt;a P.O. from Procurement Office, Fort Meade, it meant the NSA was buying
&gt;&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;When I attended Crypto '88, nearly 8 years ago, at least several of the NSA
&gt;attendees had "National Security Agency" on their name badges. It may be
&gt;that run-of-the-mill employees still maintain the fiction  for public
&gt;consumption that they are DOD employees, but such was not the case in 1988
&gt;at "Crypto."
&gt;
&gt;(Recall the "NSA Employees Manual" which 2600 liberated, and which Grady
&gt;Ward then redistributed. It had some tips, as I recall, on what employees
&gt;should tell the curious.)
&gt;
&gt;When I visited the D.C. area in early '91 or '92 (I forget which year it
&gt;was), I stopped by Fort Meade to see the place. The sign out front
&gt;prominently said "National Security Agency," complete with the NSA seal (an
&gt;eagle lifting a hacker up in its talons).
&gt;
&gt;Also, much other evidence points to the NSA having "gone public" much
&gt;farther back in time than 18-30 months ago. Former DIRNSAs on the
&gt;MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour were always introduced as former directors of the
&gt;NSA. As early as the mid-80s, as I recollect. I think Bamford's book pretty
&gt;much outed the name, though it was widely known before that, of course.
&gt;
&gt;(I attended my freshman year of high school in Langley, VA. Through the
&gt;woods on one side of the school was CIA headquarters. At that time, 1967,
&gt;it was still only labelled as something like "Department of Transportation
&gt;Road Testing Facility." Everyone knew what it really was, of course. Rick
&gt;Smith, on this list, was a classmate of mine and can attest to this. The
&gt;CIA "went public" in the early 70s, the NSA in the early 80s, the NRO in
&gt;the early 90s...I sense a pattern. This means the ultra-secret ERO
&gt;(Extraterrestrial Research Organization) will be outed in the opening years
&gt;of the next decade.)
