&gt; From: gregbrooks@earthlink.net (Greg B.)
&gt; Subject: Re: Tolls and private highways (was: Re: private highway?)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
&gt; &gt;that has been posted as well.
&gt; 
&gt; [please post my response to the appropriate usenet groups -- I'm at work
&gt; and only have email here at my office.]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;[1] How easy is it to clone a valid toll box thingie (the thing you buy
&gt; &gt;    and put in your car) ?    Such cloning has been a problem with
&gt; &gt;    cellular phones.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a custom chip inside the transponder, so cloning is going to be
&gt; pretty much impossible without access to a supply of those chips.
&gt; Additionally, the communications between the transponder and the antenna
&gt; array, as well as between the array and our computer system, are encrypted.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;[2] How actually does one buy a toll thingie and put money into an account ?
&gt; &gt;    Are they on sale at 7-11 or gas stations, or where ?
&gt; 
&gt; We offer the transponders via mail (you can call an 800 number for an
&gt; application) and via a customer-service center for walk-ins. There's some
&gt; talk of exploring mass market channels, but nothing firm yet.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[3] How does one add more money to a thingie ?  Or does one add money
&gt; &gt;    to an account, and leave the thingie unchanged ?
&gt; 
&gt; The thingie remains unchanged. (Sounds prophetic, no?) When you sign up for
&gt; an account and transponder, here's what happens: If you sign up for a
&gt; credit-card account, we take an imprint of your card in lieu of a deposit
&gt; on the transponder, and we start your account off with a minimum balance of
&gt; $40. You, as a customer, agree to let us go back to your credit card and
&gt; replenish the account based on a pre-agreed amount when the balance reaches
&gt; a minimum level (typically $10). We also do the same for checking accounts
&gt; (automatic withdrawl) and have cash options for those customers who aren't
&gt; comfy with recurring automatic transactions on their card or account. The
&gt; replenishment of the accounts is system-based -- that is, you don't need to
&gt; physically bring your transponder in for a "fill up."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[4] If one is required to give a name when setting up an account
&gt; &gt;    is it an offense to give a false name ?
&gt; 
&gt; We have an anonymous account option.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;[5] I have concerns about the privacy of the information collected
&gt; &gt;    about who goes where when.  I suspect that your company will comply
&gt; &gt;    with a court order or search warrant rather than dual to the death with
&gt; &gt;    the SWAT team.   How often and how thoroughly do you purge your
&gt; &gt;    records ?
&gt; 
&gt; Our records are much like those kept by the phone company -- they're sealed
&gt; to the public and to official requests that aren't accompanied by a court
&gt; order. One area where we're actually more concerned about privacy than the
&gt; state of California is in the area of mailing lists. Quite simply, we'll
&gt; never sell our customer list to anyone for any reason -- but even the state
&gt; DMV sells lists. We don't ever purge our records.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[6] How many intersections/on/off/ramps are there ?
&gt; 
&gt; The project is a true express lanes configuration -- no intermediate
&gt; access. Basically, you get on at one end and get off 10 miles later.
&gt; Flexible channelizers form the barrier between the freeway and the project,
&gt; so in an emergency you could get out if you needed to.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;[7] What is the speed limit and who set it  ?
&gt; 
&gt; Because the project was dedicated as part of the state highway system
&gt; before we opened to the public, the speed limit is the same as the adjacent
&gt; freeway -- 65 mph.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[8] What is the largest/heaviest/most-wheeled vehicle you accept ?
&gt; 
&gt; No trucks hauling boats or large horse trailers. No 18-wheelers. Bobtail
&gt; trucks are OK, I believe (I'll double-check this).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps!
