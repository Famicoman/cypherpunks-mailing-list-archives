&gt; I have read one paper which attempts to solve this problem, called "Human
&gt; Identification through Insecure Channel".  Unfortunately my papers are in
&gt; a mess right now so I don't have the reference handy.  It was by some
&gt; Japnese researchers, published in one of the proceedings books.  I
&gt; believe a follow-on paper was published within the last year or two which
&gt; had some improvements or corrections to their algorithm.  Sorry to be so
&gt; vague, I'll try to dig out more info over the weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically they used a challenge-response system which was intended to
&gt; be simple enough that people could do it in their heads.  The card
&gt; would display a random challenge string, some characters of which were
&gt; special to the user and others which he would ignore.  He would then
&gt; input a response string, where it didn't matter what corresponded to
&gt; the "ignore" slots, but in the special slots he had to produce certain
&gt; symbols corresponding to the other symbols, with the rules changing as
&gt; you move along.  The intention was that even by capturing and analyzing a
&gt; great many challenge-response pairs you couldn't create a response to a
&gt; challenge you hadn't seen before.
&gt; 
&gt; I coded this up, and frankly, I couldn't do the required manipulations in
&gt; my head, at least not without taking a very, very long time, and thinking
&gt; very carefully.  Maybe it would get easier with practice, I don't know.
&gt; But my overall feeling was that this would be at the limits of human
&gt; capability even for fairly bright people.  (OTOH I suppose learning to
&gt; read and write might seem pretty tough if you'd never done it.  Maybe
&gt; the 1st grade classes of the future will spend months training the kids
&gt; on how to use these kinds of algorithms.)

The paper can be found in the proceedings of Eurocrypt '91,
D.W. Davies (Ed.), Springer-Verlag.   The author is Hideki IMAI,
&lt;tsutomu@mlab.dnj.ynu.ac.jp&gt;.

I found the above paper very interesting, and I am actually going
to code it up.  Eventually, I would be highly interested in giving
a glance at your code.  Is your code available?

Ciao,
David
