&gt; "Military technologies" only work effectively against a military target.  

While generally I agree with you, I believe Esper Sata, Gerald Bull and
Pablo Escobar might have more specific disagreements.

&gt; Kill civilians and you just make other civilians angry.  At that point 
&gt; they'll be look for a weapon that "military technologies" cannot effectively 
&gt; oppose.  That weapon is already known to be possible.  

While strong cryptography is powerful, and secure communications
liberating, unplugging the phones would about cripple that 'weapon' for a
while.  Any group rebelling based only on high technology communication is
an extremely vulnerable group, both to widespread denial of service, and
more specific 'surgical' attacks.  (Motorola stock anyone?)

&gt; Quite the contrary, I think that a "successful popular uprising" will 
&gt; require only a very small investment in time and money, in which some of 
&gt; they key players in government are targeted and the prospect exists for 
&gt; easily and cheaply getting the rest.  At that point they will resign in
&gt; droves.

Firstly, uprising, even kicking people out of power might take only a
small investment in time and money, but consolidating a new system (even a
decentralized one) will be extensively expensive and time consuming.

To the extent that a successful uprising depends on organizing the new
power structure, I can't see how a successful popular uprising can be
cheap.

In addition I believe the assumption that a few, even several official
deaths will cause mass resignations ignores history.  See e.g., Columbia,
South Africa, and any number of other examples.

&gt; Government feeds on its own size; once government is dramatically reduced 
&gt; below its current size, it will become even less able to resist further 
&gt; contraction.  Probably few government employees realize this.

While I understand the point, I think that a slim efficient government is
much better able to resist "contraction."  The most effective covert
action/terrorist/political agitation groups have all been small and
closely held.  It's easier to control all aspects of operation and a
greater concentration can be put into internal security concerns as
government shrinks.  Obviously there is a critical mass, but I don't think
you will see the "runaway refrigerator" effect with government shrinkage.
