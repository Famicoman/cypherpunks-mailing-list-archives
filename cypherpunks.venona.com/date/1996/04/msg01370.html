                            "SUMMERCON IX"

			   June 15th, 1996

			Georgetown Holiday Inn
			   Washington D.C.


This is the official announcement and open invitation to the 1996
incarnation of Summercon.  In the past, Summercon was an invite-only
hacker gathering held annually in St. Louis, Missouri. Starting in
1995, SummerCon became an open event to any and all interested
parties:  Hackers, Phreaks, Pirates, Virus Writers, System Administrators,
Law Enforcement Officials, Vigilantes, Neo-Hippies, Secret Agents, Teachers,
Disgruntled Employees, Telco Flunkies, Journalists, New Yorkers, Programmers, 
Conspiracy Nuts, Musicians, Nudists, and Rug Sucking Wannabes.

LOCATION:

The Georgetown Holiday Inn
2101 Wisconsin Ave. NW
Washington, DC

The hotel is located in scenic Georgetown, close to the Mall
and the Smithsonian Museums as well as all the major tourist
attractions in D.C... 

Georgetown itself is a major tourist area, with many fine shops,
restaurants, PUBS and NIGHTCLUBS located there. If you can't
figure out anything to do here, you need to get a life pretty badly.


DIRECTIONS:

from I66 coming east:
Just keep going east. Take the Key Bridge exit off of 66,
the bridge will be a left at the 3rd light after you take
the exit. It's hard to miss, keep left and you will be forced
over the bridge pretty much. On the other side of the bridge,
take a right on M street (right and left being the ONLY choices
possible.) keep right on the bridge and you will again be forced
onto M street. Go down M and take a left at the second or third
light. Go up 2-3 blocks and take a right (either or), and
proceed to Wisconsin Ave. Take a left on Wisconsin. There is NO
left turn from M st. onto Wisconsin, thus the diverse route.
(Hey welcome to DC, run by the U.S. Congress and Mayor Barely.)
(You will soon discover the same logic that brought you the CDA.)

&gt;From MD and 95 North:
Take 95 south to 495 towards Northern Virginia.
Take the George Washington Parkway South to Key Bridge.
Follow I66 East directions above rest of the way from Key bridge.

&gt;From VA and 95 South:
Get on 395 North, follow signs to National Airport.  At National Airport,
turn around and follow directions from National Airport.
(this will keep you from getting LOST, just do it)

&gt;From National Airport:
Tell the cabbie to take you to the hotel. OR
Take George Washington Parkway to the Key Bridge / Rosslyn Exit. 
Follow I66 East directions from above from Key Bridge.

&gt;From Dulles Airport:
Tell the cabbie to take you to the hotel. OR
Take the Dulles Access road back southeast away from the Airport.
This will dump you out on I66 eastbound. (See above) If you are trying 
to get TO Dulles, take I66 westbound and get in the right hand lane 
after the Sycamore St. exit, and veer to the right to take the next
exit to the airport. Get in the left hand lane, and stay there to
avoid being on the toll road. There is a parallel road that leads
to the airport, but it's a local toll highway, stay left and avoid
giving Virginia money unnecessarily.

Taxis:
The average airport fare runs around $20 from national, to $30 for
Dulles.  Your mileage may vary however with local road conditions. 


CONFERENCE INFO:

It has always been our contention that cons are for socializing.
"Seekret Hacker InPh0" is never really discussed except in private
circles, so the only way anyone is going to get any is to meet new people
and take the initiative to start interesting conversations.

Because of this, the formal speaking portion of Summercon will be
held on one day, not two or three, leaving plenty of time for people
to explore the city, compare hacking techniques, or go trashing and
clubbing with their heretofore unseen online companions.

If you are coming from out of town and want the full hacker/tourist
experience, we will informally meet in the lobby of the Georgetown
Holiday Inn Friday, June 14th, 1996, at 2pm.  From there we will
have an informal hacker sight-seeing tour of DC, including the FBI
headquarters and other interesting (and legal) places to go.

The sight-seeing will converge with DC locals and mall security at 
2600 in Pentagon City Mall Friday, June 14th, 1996, at 6pm.  Although
this isn't the first Friday of the month, this is definitely an official
2600 meeting, and likely to be the biggest one ever.  This informal
meeting will be held until about 8pm.

The formal conference will be held on Saturday, June 15th, 1996, from
10am to 6pm (with a break for lunch).  There will be a variety of speakers,
panel discussions, demonstrations, and other events guaranteed to keep 
everyone entertained.  

No video or audio tapes will be allowed in the conference room. 
No still photography will be permitted in the conference room without
prior permission of all those being photographed.  Violation of these 
policies will result in you being asked to leave the conference.

There will be no selling of t-shirts, disks, firewalls, payphones, etc.
in or around the conference area without prior permission of the organizers.
If you are interested in demoing or selling something, please contact us
at the address listed at the bottom.  


SPEAKERS:

The speakers list for Summercon IX is still being finalized, but it is sure
to be even more dynamic and interesting than previous years.  Speakers at
Summercon '95 included such people as ex-CIA agent Robert Steele, author
Winn Shwartau, Cypherpunk founder Eric Hughes, movie producer Annaliza Savage,
and network security expert Bob Stratton.


If you are an expert in some aspect of computer, network, or telco security
and are interested in speaking at Summercon, please contact us to discuss
the possibility further at the address listed at the end of this document.

We are also going to be having short speeches by real hackers or phreakers
giving their own perspective on some issue or insight into a new technology.
This is an open invitation for you hackers to be heard; just provide us with
a brief outline of the topic you will be covering and the amount of time you
will take (suggested: 5 - 15 minutes) at the address listed below.  


COSTS:

Costs for SummerCon IX are as follows:

      Secret Service / FBI Rate: $500.00
Government / Institutional Rate: $ 80.00
       Hacker / Individual Rate: $ 20.00 


Members of the United States Secret Service or Federal Bureau of 
Investigations, and anyone that has in the past or currently is providing
information or services to the Secret Service or FBI are required to pay
the 'Secret Service / FBI Rate'.  

Employees of a local, state, or federal government, members and associates
of any L.E.O., and employees of any corporation working in the area of
computer security must pay the 'Government / Institutional Rate'.

Anyone that does not fit into one of the above categories is eligible for
the 'Individual / Hacker Rate'.

Due to historical lack of interest, there will not be pre-registration
for the conference.  Registration will begin at 9am the day of the
conference, and will continue for the duration of the conference or until
the meeting facilities have reached their capacity.  Since the latter
is likely to occur, it is suggested you don't oversleep.

No purchase orders, checks, money orders, foreign currency, stock certificates,
IOUs, or coins will be accepted for registration.  Secret Service agents,
small unmarked bills only, please.

Sorry for this being a bit more expensive than last year for the hackers, 
DC seems to be a more expensive place to hold a conference and the expenses
are several times what they were in Atlanta.

Bring money for t-shirts, they are cool!


HOTEL INFORMATION:

Georgetown Holiday Inn
2102 Wisconsin Ave NW
Washington, DC

Phone Number: (202) 338-4600

The cost for a double occupancy room at the Georgetown Holiday Inn is $99.
There is no special conference rate, there is no need to mention you are
with a conference at all, the people in reservations probably won't know
what you are talking about anyhow.  The $99 rate is however a a special
rate being held by Holiday Inn, so don't be afraid to tell them so if they
try to quote you a higher rate.

If the hotel is damaged in any manner, you are going to pay for it, and you
will probably end up in jail.  And even if you are lucky enough to get away
with it, the rest of the hackers staying at the hotel will end up paying for
it, and I'm sure that's going to make you a well-liked and respected hacker,
especially among some of the bigger hackers who might feel tempted to inflict
bodily harm on someone who causes any damage to the hotel.  Please act
responsibly, don't drink and drive, chew all your food before you swallow,
don't swallow your gum, and recycle.


CONTACTING SUMMERCON ORGANIZERS:

You can contact the Summercon organizers through e-mail.  If you haven't
figured out e-mail yet, you probably shouldn't be coming to Summercon.

As a final note, if you are planning on coming to Summercon, we would
appreciate you sending e-mail to us with the subject of "GOING TO SCON"
or something similar, just so that we have a rough idea of how many
people are going to show up.
