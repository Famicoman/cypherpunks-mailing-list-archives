&gt;&gt; That there can be no simple definition of entropy, or randomness, for an

&gt;I think what you mean is that there is no simple way to measure
&gt;randomness.  Simple, nice definitions of randomness do exist.  Actually

Well, I don't view any of the "simple definitions" of randomness as
especially useful; that is, the simple definitions have a kind of
circularity (implicit in the points we both make). For example, "an object
is "random" if it has no shorter description than itself," the classic
Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin definition, is quite elegant, but doesn't
help much in many cases. Because even this definition needs to be fleshed
out, thought about, pondered, and explored, this is why I said "there can
be no simple definition of entropy, or randomness, for an arbitrary set of
things."

Maybe you would say a simple definition does exist, but that interpreting
that definition and applying it to a set of things is harder....a
difference, I think, of emphasis. I hold that in looking at some object
(set, sequence, string, etc.) and asking "Is it random?," the very question
is misleading. It may _appear_ to be random to me, or to a particular
machine which is unable to find a compression (= shorter description,
implying nonrandomness), but someone else or some other program may find
the compression.


&gt;&gt; (To forestall charges that I am relying on an all-too-common form of
&gt;&gt; bullshitting, by referring to Godel, what I mean is that "randomness" is
&gt;&gt; best defined in terms of algorithmic information theory, a la Kolmogorov
&gt;&gt; and Chaitin, and explored in Li and Vitanyi's excellent textbook,
&gt;&gt; "Algorithmic Information Theory and its Applications.")
&gt;
&gt;A year ago, you recommended me a book by the same authors titled _An
&gt;Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications_.  Have the
&gt;authors written a new book, or are these the same?

The same book. I rely on carbon-based memory.

By the way, Greg Chaitin has a new version of his "Universal Turing
Machine" system implemented in JavaScript. At:

<A  HREF="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/c/chaitin/nv/index.html">http://www.research.ibm.com/people/c/chaitin/nv/index.html</A>

(Here I rely on non-carbon-based cut-and-paste.)
