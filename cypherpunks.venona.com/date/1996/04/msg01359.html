Tell this to Unicorn.  He seems to disagree, although he hasn't cited specifics yet.


&gt;
&gt;&gt; If that were the case, there there would be no justification for demanding a 
&gt;&gt; handwriting sample.  Nevertheless, it is apparently done.   And while a

&gt;	Can you provide a citation where a court has demanded a handwriting

Adding the conditional "for graphological purposes," I can't.  I was merely 
referring to a SC decision previously quoted here.  The writing of that 
reference didn't make clear what purposes the sample could be used for.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Question:  Let's suppose, for the purposes of argument, the policy was 
&gt;&gt; diametrically opposite, and no such samples were taken, ostensibly because 
&gt;
&gt;	The gist of the argument is that handwriting samples are public,
&gt;	and that things are written for public consumption, not private

&gt;
&gt;&gt; would come to the opposite conclusion.  You would have to explain to people 
&gt;&gt; why the precedents were all wrong.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	You are taking a completely hypothetical situation that never had
&gt;	a basis in what could have happened.

No.  What I was trying to do is to get people to stop thinking of legal 
precedent as being some sort of end-all incident that makes all further 
discussion pointless.  



&gt;&gt; demanded of a defendant in 1783, which was about when the 5th amendment was 
&gt;&gt; written.
&gt;
&gt;	What they said.
&gt;	Where they said it. 
&gt;	What they had in their possession.
&gt;	Where they had said items in their possession.
&gt;
&gt;	Note in passing that rules for admitting something into 
&gt;	evidence was a lot looser then, than it is now. 

If that's really the case, and this would today be considered a clear violation of the 5th, what does that say about the claim that "current government policy" must be right?
