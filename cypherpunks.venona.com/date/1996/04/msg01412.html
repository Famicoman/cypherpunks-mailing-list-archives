&gt; &gt;I'm sure it has been. That doesn't mean his report is untrue.  Is the
&gt; &gt;standard of proof the same for both of these issues?  We need proof to
&gt; &gt;establish that Weaver is a racist, but not to establish that the FBI
&gt; &gt;informant is lying?
&gt; 
&gt;         I require a higher standard of proof for worse accusations. I
&gt; consider calling someone a racist a worse insult than calling them a
&gt; liar. Furthermore, that this is an FBI _informant_ is a strike against
&gt; the person to begin with in terms of trustworthiness.

Interesting. Thanks for explaining your terms. I disagree with everything
you're saying. :-)

I consider "racist" to be an ideological label, not an insult at all
(though personally, I find them sick and wrong). There's a lot of people
out there who proudly call themselves racists, at least in private. Many
of them I can have a civilized discussion with. For me, liar is a stronger
word.

I think it's good to keep the FBI informed, in general terms only. Keeps
the FBI from wigging out, you know. Self-conscious "infiltrators" and
especially "provocateurs" I would consider to be liars, but someone who
merely keeps the lines of communication open is a friend of mine. 

&gt; &gt;Separatist/supremacist...  I don't see much difference between them, and I
&gt; &gt;believe the former is largely just a cover story for the latter.  Weaver
&gt; &gt;is no hero, IMHO, though I believe the govt. fucked up big at Ruby Ridge.
&gt; 
&gt;         I don't approve of either separatists or supremacists; I just see the
&gt; former as not quite as evil as the latter. Calling Weaver a supremacist is
&gt; most common among the organizations that seem to believe that such actions as
&gt; at Ruby Ridge are just fine, so long as they are against their enemies; it
&gt; appears to be a public relations ploy (although the evidence is admittedly
&gt; uncertain).

Who has defended the government's lies and shoot-at-sight rules of
engagement at Ruby Ridge? Please be specific. I think you're talking about
some straw man you read about in an NRA or militia pamplet.
