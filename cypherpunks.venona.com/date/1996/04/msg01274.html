I beleive the distilled wisdom on entropy availability is summed up by Wei
Dai's post.  On Sat, 20 Apr 1996 17:21 -0700 Wei Dai &lt;weidai@eskimo.com&gt;
said:

&gt;It appears that a consensus has been established on cypherpunks regarding
                                            he meant coderpunks [bf]
&gt;entropy estimation.  Hal summarized it nicely:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The first is whether this mysterious black box, the entropy estimator,
&gt;&gt; is really possible.  In practice the only way to know how much entropy
&gt;&gt; you've gotten is to have a model for how the data is being generated,
&gt;&gt; and to deduce from that an estimate of the entropy rate.  So the entropy
&gt;&gt; estimator can't be a general-purpose calcluation, but it must be one
&gt;&gt; which is specifically chosen, developed and tuned for the specific source
&gt;&gt; of entropy you are dealing with.
&gt;
&gt;I believe this whole thread about randomness and entropy started with the
&gt;search for a portable software RNG and the discussion of how to estimate
&gt;the entropy of spinners.  If we accept the above paragraph, then we have
&gt;to reject spinners as a candidate for such a RNG, for two reasons.  First,
&gt;we have no model of how spinners generate randomness, so we can't estimate
&gt;their entropy.  Second, even if we developed such a model for a particular
&gt;spinner on a particular OS, the model itself would not be portable because
&gt;it would likely rely on nonportable assumptions about the OS.
&gt;
&gt;Do we have other candidates for portable software RNGs?

&gt;&gt; I have thought about the sources of entropy available to a Java applet, and

&gt;&gt; encryption keys, and Initialization vectors
...
&gt;Is it feasible to make an input package that stores up entropy from
&gt;keyboard and mouse events as an applet is used?  Then when entropy is
&gt;needed, whatever's available is used.  If there's not enough a scribble
&gt;window or text field could pop up and the user could generate the rest. 
&gt;(This isn't my idea, I'm inferring it from something Hal wrote.)

I don't think there is a way to get "normal" keyboard/mouse data.  A
"scribble" window is certainly a possibility.  However, see my comments
below.


&gt;And over the long run, what, if anything, could Sun do to let applets have
&gt;access to more entropy in Java?  Would it be practical to have an entropy
&gt;source in the api, that could be combined with other sources in the 
&gt;applet?

&gt;Subject: Entropy overestimation in Ted Ts'o's /dev/random driver
&gt;Date: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 17:24:39 -0400
&gt;
&gt;I just played around a bit with Ted's /dev/random driver a bit more..
&gt;
&gt;It appears that the add_timer_randomness() function may overestimate
&gt;the amount of entropy in a sequence of timestamps by a factor of five
&gt;or more.  It attempts to keep track of first- and second-order deltas
&gt;in order to avoid overestimating the amount of entropy added; however,
&gt;it seems like this may not be enough.
&gt;
&gt;Adding a third-order delta, and doing the 2nd and 3rd-order deltas on
&gt;the absolute value of the lower deltas seems to make things better..

Note that what Ted is using and Bill Sommerfeld is commenting on is
basically a spinner.  In looking over the detailed data (which I have not
copied), it appears to me that even adding the 3rd order deltas may leave
the actual entropy overestimated.  The source of entropy is basically the
system scheduler.  It is a deterministic process, which depends slightly on
the somewhat less deterministic processes of I/O interrupts etc.  I feel
uncomfortable estimating 1 bit/second from it, and prefer to accept Wai
Dai's zero bits/second.

One severe problem we seem to have is that all automatic entropy estimation
techniques tend to over-estimate the amount of entropy present.

Perhaps when the millennium comes, we will have hardware generation and be
able to sleep at night.
