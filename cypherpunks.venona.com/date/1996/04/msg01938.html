&gt;	I haven't seen a list of your conditions yet.
&gt;
&gt;	How about placing your minimally acceptable requirements

At the very least, he'd have to IDENTIFY himself at least to the extent that 
I have done so.  Name, address, telephone number, etc.  


&gt;&gt; the examples quoted in that SC decision, which were cited as exceptions to 
&gt;&gt; 5th amendment protections in the US, all of them represent examples which 
&gt;&gt; were only considered technologically useful in the last 100 years, the 
&gt;&gt; oldest being fingerprinting.  Given this, it is easy to conclude that there 
&gt;
&gt;	Which makes it interesting that he provides an Ecclesiastical 
&gt;	Court Decision from the Seventeenth Century.  
&gt;
&gt;	It isn't the US, but you haven't made an limitations 
&gt;	as to which legal system is acceptable.

As you quoted me above, you are aware that my point was that the SC-listed 
exceptions to the 5th amendment were recent and didn't have older US 
precedent.  I claimed that there was no logical reason to believe that such 
claimed exceptions were anything other than comparatively recent excuses 
given to allow violations of the 5th amendment.   While I am not totally 
disinterested in foreign examples, that was NOT the area under discussion. A 
foreign example is irrelevant because it does not challenge my claim. Notice 
that Unicorn has studiously avoided my original observation.
