	The following showed up on a public radio-oriented mailing list
I occasionally read - if this is really a true report by a confessed
cordless/cellular scanner freak who got caught taping calls and passing
the tapes around it is certainly illuminating as someone in an official
position may have possibly said much more than more sophisticated law
enforcement eavesdroppers would ever admit to.  Clearly most people
would think the law in the matter was very different than the attitude
here expressed, though I think that many of the more cynical would view
this as no surprise at all and indeed SOP in most investigative
agencies,

	I cannot vouch for the identity of the poster or the veracity of
this.  However I think it certainly shows the official attitude that has
made many of us advocates of encryption, particularly of wireless
communications, and deeply suspicious of the notion that court ordered
wiretaps are the only ones used by the police and other agencies.

CORDLESS PHONE MONITORING: --  I was accused of monitoring phone
conversations of public officals  over a scanner.  I was accused of taping
said conversations in which the public officals were conducting town
buissness in a illegal manner etc. The allegded tapes (copies) were
allegedly passed around to "other" town officals for them to hear what was
being  "said", "done", and what actions were about to unfold. A
investigation by the Mass. District Attoney was ordered and the results if
that investigation is as follows ---- "The information available during this
investigation indicated that the telephone calls which were tape recorded
were made on a cellular telephone or a portable telephone. No evidence was
obtained indicating a wire communication was illegally intercepted and
recorded. The audio tape that was around the town of $%#@!%^%$$ and played
for several individuals was not recovered. @@  @#$$#%  ^%%&amp;*  found the tape
left on the front seat of %$^  car  and had it for a period of time, but
does not have it or knew where it was at this time. This officer (police)
explained to those directly involved that cellular telephone conversations
and any conversation that is transmitted over the airwaves is not protected
communitations, as there is no expectation of privacy in the open airways. I
further informed those involved that there are people who have nothing
better to do then listen and record such cellular telephone calls and this
means of communication is not secure. This officer requests that this
investigation be closed".     That is from the Masssachusetts District
Attoney's Office in  Barnstable,Mass. ******** In fact when I was
interviewed I was told flat out that lawenforcement "does not want" it to be
against the law, because not only do they hear about drug transactions which
allows them to bust subjects, "BUT" it  is also a saftey tool, for at times
the people under survailance talk using this type of communication and they
(POLICE) can find out if the subject(s)  have weapons, etc. etc......!!!!!
That's what my experience in this area is... Happy Scanning!!!!!!!!!!
