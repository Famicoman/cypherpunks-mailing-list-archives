   Peeking at Your P.C. [Op-Ed]

   By Simson L. Garfinkel


   Cambridge, Mass.

   As more Americans use electronic mail, buy products over
   the Internet and keep their most personal records on
   desktop computers, there is increasing demand for
   cryptography software that can insure the privacy of
   personal electronic communication.

   This technology already exists, but the Government, through
   export-control regulations, effectively bars citizens from
   using it.

   The Government classifies encryption software as munitions,
   because foreign countries can use such programs to hide
   their communications during times of war. To prevent this,
   American companies are largely prohibited from selling to
   foreign customers any programs that include strong coding
   features.

   Unfortunately, that has stifled the domestic market.

   Encryption-software developers find it too expensive to
   create two versions of their programs -- one with strong
   cryptography for domestic use and one with cryptography
   that is weak enough for export. So in the United States,
   developers sell only the weaker cryptography software.

   Last month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced "The
   Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" to combat
   this problem. But while this measure would increase the
   availability of good cryptography at home, it would limit
   our freedoms in other ways.

   The act would legalize the export of any mass-market
   software if similar technology is already available
   overseas. This would put an end to the futility of
   forbidding such exports at a time when cryptography
   technology is increasingly available around the globe -- in
   libraries and on the Internet. Indeed, the Software
   Publishers Association says that the main result of the
   export regulations simply has been to shift the overseas
   marketing of military-grade cryp tography to foreign
   companies.

   So although the new bill would still prohibit American
   companies from exporting innovative programs, it would at
   least allow them to compete with foreign companies on an
   equal footing.

   However, the Clinton Administration and others oppose this
   minor change, because they are worried that criminals and
   terrorists could use the export liberalization to their own
   advantage.

   Because of this opposition, the bill throws a bone to the
   antiprivacy forces.

   While lifting export controls, it criminalizes some uses of
   cryptography for the first time in our nation's history. It
   would be illegal, for instance, to use encryption that
   interferes with a felony investigation. But the language of
   the bill is so broad that these restrictions could apply to
   a reporter's encrypted computer files.

   The bill also creates legal rules for "key holders" --
   organizations that would be given copies of an individual's
   decryption key, or codebreaker. This means that an
   individual's encoded messages or documents could be
   decoded, under a court order, without his or her knowledge.

   Although the use of key holders would be voluntary under
   the bill, that could easily change and the system could
   become mandatory.

   There is some hope for avoiding all this. Senator Conrad
   Burns, Republican of Montana, plans to introduce a narrower
   bill that focuses simply on liberalizing exports of
   encryption technology.

   The software industry and civil libertarians are already
   supporting this approach -- one that is good not just for
   American business but also for our right to privacy.

   Good Privacy."
