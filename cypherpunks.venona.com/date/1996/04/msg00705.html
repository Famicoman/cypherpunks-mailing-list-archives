Vernor,

What's your thinking on some privacy protection measures for these types of
"embedded systems?" Shouldn't these kinds of "instruments" (one
ringy-dingy) have some user-defeats or -definable permissions settings
built in from Day One?

Do we risk e$ accounts being billed automatically by water/gas/electric
meters on a daily basis without the possibility of users disputing the
readings in a timely way? Is anyone proposing permissions on such boxes?
What're the proposals, if any, for how the automated calls they make get
billed, get scheduled and show up on customer phone bills? I wonder if the
bills decrease, since this all saves the companies lots of money?

I'm all for "smart houses" but I'd prefer they learn the tricks _I_ teach 'em.

&gt;Subject: H2O Phone Taps
&gt;
&gt;WATER METER PHONE TAPS
&gt;
&gt;Recently, I received notice from our local water department (Algonquin,
&gt;Illinois) that new water meters are to be installed in every residence.
&gt;The twist is that the new meter taps into our telephone line and
&gt;periodically and automatically reports the meter reading to the water
&gt;department.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps this is innocent enough but, being ever vigilant about my privacy,
&gt;I've contacted the water department to get more info which they've
&gt;promised to send. Interestingly, they told me I didn't have to accept this
&gt;phone-tap meter, however they asked to install a different meter with a
&gt;similar type of reporting device which is triggered via a device that also
&gt;receives the meter reading (from just outside my house). I can only assume
&gt;this transmission is made via a radio transmitter on the meter (which
&gt;isn't really much of a consolation for me). This seems a bit oxymoronical
&gt;since there already exists an external meter gauge on the exterior of my
&gt;house. What is the advantage to standing outside my home with a
&gt;transmitter/receiver over visually reading the external meter gauge???
&gt;
&gt;Obviously, how can one tell what the little micro-chip within the gizmo is
&gt;*really* programmed to do? As you might imagine, I'm not at all
&gt;comfortable with this thing wired into my phone line. I know..... if Big
&gt;Brother wants to, he can listen in to my phone conversations or even into
&gt;my house without such hard-wire tap. But I don't feel compelled to
&gt;willingly submit to a potential invasion of my privacy, none-the-less!
&gt;
&gt;I can only assume resisting the installation of this Orwellian device will
&gt;result in putting my name on every Barney Fife "what's he got to hide"
&gt;list - who knows.
&gt;
&gt;I urge everyone who reads this to be vigilant about such things. If you
&gt;receive such a notice from a public utility, you might be well advised to
&gt;question them as I am doing. Sadly, most of my neighbors are probably
&gt;submitting to this without a thought as I've not seen any letters of
&gt;protest to the editor of the local newspaper ....a sign of the times, I
&gt;guess.
