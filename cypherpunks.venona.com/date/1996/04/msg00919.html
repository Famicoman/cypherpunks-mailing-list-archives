FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Security Dynamics to Acquire RSA in Transaction Valued at Approximately
$200 Million

Cambridge MA and Redwood City, CA -- April 15, 1996 -- Security Dynamics
Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SDTI) and RSA Data Security, Inc. today
announced that they have signed a definitive agreement for Security
Dynamics to acquire RSA, a Redwood City, California vendor of encryption
software. The transaction is intended to be carried out by the merger of
RSA and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security Dynamics in a tax-free
transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. For the year ended
December 31, 1995, RSA had revenues and net income of approximately
$11,6000,000 and $950,000, respectively.

Upon consummation of the merger, Security Dynamics will issue or reserve
for issuance 4,000,000 shares of its Common Stock in exchange for all of
the outstanding shares and options to acquire shares of RSA. Based on the
closing price of Security Dynamics Common Stock on the Nasdaq Market on
April 12, 1996, the transaction is valued at approximately $200,000,000.
The transaction is scheduled to close in June 1996.

The consummation of the merger is subject to approval by the stockholders
of both Security Dynamics and RSA and the satisfaction of antitrust and
certain other conditions. In connection with the merger agreement, certain
RSA stockholders, who currently own approximately 70% of the outstanding
shares of RSA, have agreed to vote their RSA shares in favor of the merger.

"RSA's technology is an excellent fit with Security Dynamics'
enterprise-wide security solutions," said Charles R. Stuckey, Jr.,
President and Chief Executive Office of Security Dynamics. "In the rapidly
growing Internet and Intranet markets, security has become on of the major
issues. The merger of RSA and Security Dynamics combines our user
identification and authentication technology and RSA's public key and
encryption technology, each of which is a de facto standard. We believe
this brings into a single organization the management and technical talent
needed to bring to market the most effective security applications."

"The synergy between the two companies is outstanding," said Jim Bidzos,
President and Chief Executive Officer of RSA. "RSA and Security Dynamics
technologies must be delivered as an integrated solution to corporate and
Internet users. The best way to accomplish this is for the two companies to
become one."

According to both executives, RSA will continue its existing license
business as a subsidiary of Security Dynamics.
