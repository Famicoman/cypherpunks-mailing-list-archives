Thank you for the thoughtful comments.

&gt; I just read your paper and had a couple quick comments, I used to think that
&gt; the Internet would be an ultimate promoter of liberal democratic values,
&gt; however given recent events in asian countries (which you mention)
&gt; particularly actions of China (which you didn't) I am not at all sure that
&gt; this will be the case -- of course, one can't prove these things, but I tend
&gt; to believe that China could actually clamp down on the freedom of speech
&gt; with respect to the following:

I agree that the next draft should discuss China more.  I think China 
could probably clamp down very effectively.  I am not persuaded it could 
do so without giving up a very large share of the benefits of access.

&gt; 
&gt; "Like it or not, we live now in an age of completely free speech..." I think
&gt; it would be very worthwhile to examine what is meant by "free speech." I
&gt; don't think free speech means, if I want, I could say what I want and no one

alas, this is beyond the scope of this essay.  There's a huge literature 
on this in the law reviews, though.
[...]
&gt; 
&gt; So perhaps the Internet shall provide a mechanism for practical free speech
&gt; (allowing some to speak their minds, and the others that get trapped will
&gt; get crushed) but it shouldn't be considered a subsitute for political free
&gt; speech (in which no one gets crushed). In the case of countries like China,

I agree.  It's not a substitute.  Just an enabler in places that don't 
choose to practice draconian access control.

&gt; the hope is that the practical free speech will enable political free
&gt; speech, but based on news reports I am seeing this is less likely than I
&gt; used to think, and as you mention in the section  of "Mobility of Personal
&gt; Data" the capability of this technology to abuse the citizens' and
&gt; customers' rights are also increasing, but their isn't an open mailing list
&gt; on which everyone can examine the conversation between the organizations
&gt; which wish to accomplish this.
