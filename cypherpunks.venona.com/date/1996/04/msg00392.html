&gt;Jon asked why it is that I contend that a compression algorithm won't
&gt;in the general case even out the entropy of a semi-random stream.

I am not talking about any "general case," I proposed compressing spinner
data, which has sequences of repeating numbers interspersed with occasional
quasi-random fluctuations.  I am not saying that compression is a "magic
wand" that will fix data streams with a lot of "fake" entropy, such as the
RND() function available in many BASIC's, which I think most of us will agree
blows chunks.

&gt;The answer can be obtained by simply trying to run gzip over an image,
&gt;preferably one that hasn't been compressed. The results are, in
&gt;general, very bad, even though images are highly compressable (even
&gt;losslessly). I leave the why up as an exercise to the reader.

I have ZIPed the aforementioned spinner data with the built-in ZIP routines
in the PC Tools for Windows file manager.  Except for some very slight
banding (which appears to be caused by the ZIP headers) the noise sphere
plots look pretty good.  All files are available upon request for independent
verification.

&gt;I have said before and I will say again that the only reliable way of
&gt;dealing with a stream that has some amount of randomness mixed in with
&gt;it that you wish to distil down into pure random bits is to use solid
&gt;reasoning to figure out how many bits of entropy per unit of input you
&gt;can actually expect to see, add a large fudge factor to cover your
&gt;ass, and then distil down using a cryptographic hash.

I have no disagreements with this.  I merely proposed using the compression
function as a means of roughly estimating entropy and preventing the seeding
of the hash/PRNG with potentially "weak key" type data.

&gt;Anything else
&gt;makes me highly nervous. If you can't estimate the amount of entropy
&gt;in an input stream from first principles, then you are probably in
&gt;trouble and should seek an input stream that you have a better handle
&gt;on.

Would anyone like to propose a means of measuring entropy that we can all
agree on?  I haven't seen anything yet that everyone likes.
