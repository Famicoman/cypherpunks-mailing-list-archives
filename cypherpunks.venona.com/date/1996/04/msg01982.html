&gt; Meanwhile, Robert Ludlum's got a new book out, doing another

&gt; leaked out by the Neo-Nazis frames many prominent people as Nazis,
&gt; a critical few of whom really are.  And there's a bad parody of a
&gt; fat talk-show host somewhat to the right of Attila the Hun
&gt; (Caller: "Double whippo, Arnie!") who gets framed on the air...

That's funny; maybe I'll check it out in my spare time. Yeah, right.

The scary thing is, there are people who actually BELIEVE that shit. Or,
from the "other side," Clancy's rants, or The Turner Diaries, or Marx's
poor algebra in Das Kapital. You shouldn't base your life on fiction.

I'd guess that there are no more than 5,000 serious Nazis left in the
whole world who actually favor totalitarianism and genocide. It's quite
obvious who they are. They're not a threat, but it's probably good to
harry them, because otherwise, they might become a threat. (The 5K
estimate does *not* include other totalitarian/genocidal movements, and
I'm not interested in debating parallels. When I say "Nazi," which is
pretty rare, I mean "Nazi," someone who has read and agrees with the
"Nation and Race" chapter of Mein Kampf.)

Disinformation is stronger than a lot of people think. Or maybe I'm just
saying that :-)

&gt; Foo - even I've had contacts in the Sendero Luminoso, though they
&gt; all would have strictly denied it - they were just "good Socialist
&gt; college students" and "immigrant refugees" from Peru, which _does_ have
&gt; a fairly brutal and sleazy elected dictator.  Not everybody in the
&gt; anti-war business is pro-peace.

My academic work involved Latin American revolutionary movements. I have
some idea.

&gt; &gt;Truth is far more fragile than fiction.
&gt; Sure, cause fiction's supposed to make sense.

Never thought of it that way, but I believe that's the crux of the
problem...
