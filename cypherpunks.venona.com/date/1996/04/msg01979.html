&gt; Does anyone know of articles regarding the possibility of subverting

&gt; TIA,

I received several responses to this question.  My favorite was as follows...

&gt;This is probably science fiction, particularly at the VHDL level.
&gt;Maybe someone could make a crime of opportunity out of a microcode
&gt;flaw, but there's a risk of it being found out during testing.
&gt;
&gt;To do it right would require collusion of the design and test teams.
&gt;They need to ensure the back door stays closed, isn't tickled by
&gt;"normal" testing and only opens when really requested. So a lot of
&gt;people are in on the secret even before it gets exploited for
&gt;nefarious purposes.
&gt;
&gt;And what nefarious purposes would pay for the risks and costs of this?
&gt;If the secret got out, the design team, product line, and company
&gt;would be dead in the marketplace and probably spend the rest of their
&gt;lives responding to lawsuits. What could you use this for that is
&gt;worth the risk?
&gt;
&gt;Trying to do it to the compiler (like Thompson inserting a back door
&gt;in login using the Unix C compiler) is, again, theoretically possible.
&gt;But the only reason to hack the compiler would be to do the deed
&gt;without involving the processor development team. Risky in terms of
&gt;building a reliable back door and the risk of detection. It might not
&gt;work and the changes might be detected. To do it right would probably
&gt;involve as many technical people as the processor development itself.
&gt;Even "high grade threats" have finite resources -- there aren't that
&gt;many processor design gurus in the world to start with.
&gt;
&gt;At best, this might make a good plot element for Tom Clancy.&gt;

Still, I'm left feeling a little uneasy.
My reasons for this are

1) Trusting the processor means trusting something I don't fully understand.
2) Processors these days are extremely complex.
3) On April 3rd, at Interop, Peter Neumann (in his keynote presentation)
disclosed that a random number generator chip used in slot machines had
been compromised.  This lead to a huge bogus jackpot, and an investigation
that revealed the scheme.

It looks like I may have no other option than to give some processor some
degree of trust. Which processor I should choose, and why that one?

TIA,
Jeff
