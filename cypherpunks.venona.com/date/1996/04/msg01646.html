	I have been researching the issue of ratings for some time, and
thinking of getting a SafeSurf rating for a few pages as an experiment,
so this "patrolling" is pretty interesting:

"Gabriel" writes:
&gt; The answer is yes.  So how can Safesurf be sure that sites registered with
&gt; them are indeed genuinely kidsafe?  Simple - someone has to go and check
&gt; out all the sites who register with Safesurf.

	Now, would you be kind enough to tell me what happens next?
Suppose you check out a site and find it is in your opinion not
"kidsafe". What do you do in that case? This is not clear from your message. 
	If the essence of the the SafeSurf system is "voluntary" ratings,
are you not substituting your own standard? After all, in reference to
Declan McCullagh's point about the fight-censorship archives, you say:

"Why ask?  Clearly a site with a message like this would not be suitable for
children to read.  That would be an adult site rating."

	Clearly then, you have some standard you are applying, which
seems in this case be roughly "any archive which contains any message
with any sexual content, no matter what the context or proportion, does
not qualify as "kidsafe" in the CyberAngels view."
	So, in reality do we not have two standards here, the site's
"voluntary" one, and the one the CyberAngels apply to the site? Only if
the two coincide will all be well. Thus, is it not reasonable to ask
that the CyberAngels at least make clear their criteria? I collect items
such as this (ratings systems), I would be very interested in what the
CyberAngels have come up with.

P.S. I don't know if you're a recent recruit or not, but Curtis Sliwa
has a checkered history at best. Given the fabrications in the Angel's
past, what can we expect in their future?

               against Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, on 
               the grounds that he had injured the union's reputation by
