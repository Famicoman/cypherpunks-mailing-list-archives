[By the way, that ILF/SAC rant WAS a joke. It's disappointing how many
people were trolled, but on the other hand, it taught me something about
how I come across, and to be more careful.]

&gt; &gt; To be fair, I don't see any blathering, just "expressions of concern." The

&gt; Get real dude. Of course it's blathering. Either he really is that stupid
&gt; or he's trying to appeal to people's ignorant fears about the Net as some
&gt; sort of Satanic gathering place, just to get reelected.

You have extrapolated this from a sentence fragment taken from an
off-the-cuff answer to a question from a Japanese reporter? Either you
have a subtle mind indeed, or you're blathering, too.

Remember that speech Clinton gave to the Association of Community Colleges
where he blamed the Oklahoma bombing on talk radio hosts and called for
censorship? Didn't happen. My friends in the NRA, and the occasional fund
raising letter (I've been a member of the NRA for years), keep bringing up
this speech for propaganda purposes, but it's much more a legend than a
truth.

This sounds like "fight speech you disagree with with more speech" to me.

&gt; &gt; Clinton, though, is pushing the unconstitutional "anti-terrorism"  bill,
&gt; &gt; which is all blather, and worse, he's letting the Republicans add an
&gt; &gt; unrelated rider that emasculates habeus corpus.

I'd like to retract that "Republicans" bit. There are good Republicans and
bad Republicans, as with any other group of people. I meant "pro-death
penalty, anti-civil liberties wackos," of which there are a few in the
Republican Party, but which do not represent the rank &amp; file or even the
balance of the GOP Congressional delegation.

&gt; Letting the Republicans? Clinton's on their side all the way.

Not on habeus corpus. To refresh your memory, I'm talking about the
amendment that seeks to curtail death-row appeals. Clinton has condemned
it as irrelevant to the "anti-terrorism" bill, but that it's a compromise
he can accept. He's wrong.
