forwarded from rnewman@cybercom.net (Ron Newman):

Here's what Grady said to me in several messages.  Note that
they seem to be after anon.penet.fi again too.

(He has given me blanket permission to distribute his e-mail to me to
 anyone who may find it of use.)

I've just received e-mail from:

kaj.malmberg@mallu.pp.fi (Kaj Malmberg)

The Poilice CID in Helsinki who is being pushed by the criminal cult yet
again to get a search warrant for Julf's anonymous remailer, claiming I
have been violating my injunction to post cult crap.

I told him that as usual the criminal cult is lying and that I gave him
and Julf explicit permission to investigate any or all of my posts I have
ever made through the remailer.

The criminal cult is trying to use the fact of my injunction to further
their own conspiracy theories.  South Africa, Finland, where does it end?

&gt;Why did you give them this permission?  I think it sets a VERY bad
&gt;precedent.  Chris Schafmeister was upset when I mentioned this
&gt;on the IRC channel yesterday afternoon -- he thinks you're being
&gt;too nice, polite, and cooperative for your own good.

I like to err on the side of openness. Each to their own I suppose.
Basically I trust Kaj to sense who is the criminal perpetrator in this
case. I also sent him the set of trial stipulations in the Snow White case
that ought to give him very interesting background on the criminal cult.

&gt;In my opinion, Julf and the Finnish cop should Just Say No
&gt;to the CoS.

He is still free to do as he wishes.

Subject: Re: a few more questions

No one was with me.

Total hours day one: 7.5
Total hours day two: 3.25 hours, as per order of Judge Infante. Also I
believe all american anonymous remailers will be subpoenaed for their
records as will all my ISPs, and contents of safety deposit box held as
evidence.

&gt;How many hours total did you go each day?

Subject: Re: what is the latest regarding penet?

I don't know what's up today, but Julf wrote yesterday
to tell me that my id grady@northcoast.com had NOT
been used to go through his remailer.

No word on what the police are doing to subpoena his system,
if they are.

That is all he told me: that he could verify to authorities
that grady@northcoast.com had not used his remailer.

He didn;t mention anyone else or how he was helping the CID
with their inquiries.  Yes, you can put this datum on the web.

&gt;
&gt;Has he said anything in public about this?
&gt;
&gt;Should I post your message about it on my web site?
