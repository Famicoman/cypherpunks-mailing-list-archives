According to _The Hacker Jargon File 2.9.12_:

::byte:: /bi:t/ [techspeak] n. A unit of memory or data equal to
the amount used to represent one character; on modern architectures
this is usually 8 bits, but may be 9 on 36-bit machines.  Some
older architectures used `byte' for quantities of 6 or 7 bits, and
the PDP-10 supported `bytes' that were actually bitfields of
1 to 36 bits!  These usages are now obsolete, and even 9-bit bytes
have become rare in the general trend toward power-of-2 word sizes.
 
Historical note: The term originated in 1956 during the early
design phase for the IBM Stretch computer; originally it was
described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment of the period
used 6-bit chunks of information).  The move to an 8-bit byte
happened in late 1956, and this size was later adopted and
promulgated as a standard by the System/360.  The term `byte' was
coined by mutating the word `bite' so it would not be accidentally
misspelled as bit.  See also nybble.
