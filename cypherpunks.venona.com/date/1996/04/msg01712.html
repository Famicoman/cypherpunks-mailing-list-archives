&gt;Billionaires' tax loophole could complicate passage of health reform
&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;WASHINGTON (Apr 28, 1996 1:47 p.m. EDT) -- A once white-hot, but still
&gt;smoldering, partisan dispute over taxation of expatriate billionaires could
&gt;further complicate enactment of a popular measure making health insurance
&gt;portable from job to job.

[...]

&gt;But an effort to plug a loophole that's allowed a handful of wealthy people
&gt;to avoid taxes by renouncing their citizenship could put another hurdle
&gt;before a health bill all sides say they want.

&gt;Competing expatriate billionaire provisions are tucked into separate health
&gt;bills that cleared the Senate last week and the House in March.

&gt;In an approach recommended by the Clinton administration, the Senate would
&gt;impose an immediate capital gains tax on the assets of wealthy people when
&gt;they renounce their citizenship.

&gt;However, the House bill, crafted by Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
&gt;R-Texas, takes an entirely different approach that Democrats and the
&gt;administration say leaves the loophole wide open.

&gt;House and Senate lawmakers haven't met yet to work out the differences
&gt;between the two health bills. But if past negotiations on the expatriation
&gt;issue are any indication, the House version will emerge victorious.

[...]

&gt;Instead of imposing a large and immediate tax on wealthy citizenship
&gt;renouncers, the House version tightens current law. It requires expatriates
&gt;with a net worth of $500,000 or more to pay taxes on capital gains and
&gt;other income from U.S.-based assets for 10 years after they renounce their
&gt;citizenship.

&gt;But critics say it will accomplish little more than forcing accountants and
&gt;lawyers to find more creative ways around the rules on behalf of
&gt;billionaire citizenship renouncers such as Campbell soup fortune heir John
&gt;Dorrance III and Dart Container Corp. President Kenneth Dart.

&gt;The House version would be extremely difficult to enforce and would allow
&gt;patient expatriates to avoid the tax by holding their assets for 10 years
&gt;before selling, they say. In the interim, they could raise cash by
&gt;borrowing against the assets.

[...]

&gt;However, Archer says his committee's version is actually tougher. The
&gt;administration's proposal would create an incentive for people who had
&gt;recently inherited their wealth to expatriate before their newly acquired
&gt;assets started to appreciate, he said.

&gt;"The reality is their proposal is weaker than ours," Archer said. "Some of
&gt;the most egregious cases are where there have been heirs that have been
&gt;recipients of estates who can under their proposal leave and never pay
&gt;anything."
