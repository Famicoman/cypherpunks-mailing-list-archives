	Yes. War, especially in the modern era requires a large 
industrial base to maintain (well, non-guerilla operations anyway) 

&gt; of Tokyo? (10% died in one raid).  Stalins execution of his own people?

	Yes, as above.               To accomplish his goals, yes. IMO, no. 

&gt; Look at facts, not propoganda, before coming to such conclusions.
&gt; The conventions of war (namely the aim of keeping civilians out of it,
&gt; along with good treatment of prisoners) evolved over many centuries,

	Centuries? Maybe 3 of them, the 1600's, 1700's and 1800's, more 
like never.

&gt; but then come the Brits and the Yanks to destroy it all with their
&gt; indiscriminate bombing of civilians, using the "they can stop the
&gt; torture simply by surrendering," and "those bombs saved countless

	There has been a long history of taking the war to the civilians. 
Salting crop land, poisoning wells, burning cities--long before Sherman 
marched on Atlanta civilians were targets. The Aristocracy didn't 
approve publically, but what does a blockade accomplish if not to deprive 
civilians of certain things? Yes, it also keeps it out of the hands of 
the Military, but it also affects non-military. 

&gt; [American/British] lives!" excuses, and directing attention away from
&gt; their own attrocities by spreading propoganda such as soap made from
&gt; Jews.  Then to direct attention away from themselves even further, the
&gt; victors judge the defeated at Nuremburg for "war crimes," when the
&gt; accusors themselves were guilty of terror bombing, the worst war crime
&gt; of them all.

	War is a most nasty thing, and often fought by people who are at 
very impressionable age (young men). Watching your friends and buddies 
die is a tough thing for most, as is killing other people. For most 
people killing is not something to be done lightly, and it is necessary 
to work them into a state were killing is possible. This state also tends 
to make certain actions seem like a good idea. 

	As to the Strategic decesions like the bombing of Dresden and the 
Nuking of Japan, well, when is the last time a Political leader (and High 
Ranking Generals ARE Political Leaders) actually stopped to consider the 
lives or feelings of people that aren't going to vote for hir?

&gt; | and the Holocaust (people who claim
&gt; | it didn't happen are calling my paternal grandfather a liar).
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody really claim it did not happen?  I doubt it.
&gt; I assert that those who express doubt over details of the current
&gt; story (such as the numbers that died in the camps, the existence of
&gt; gas chambers, or whether Hitler gave an order to systematically kill
&gt; Jews) are referred to by the media as saying that the Holocaust didn't

	I doubt Hitler explicitly said "Kill all the jews for me would 
you Gobby?" but hey, the guy was the ABSOLUTE RULER, he made his desires 
known, and things happened. 

&gt; happen, but that is *not* what they are saying.  With regard to your
&gt; hundreds of thousands of people died, then who would disagree with him?
&gt; If on the other hand he asserts that he saw gassed Jews at Dachau,
&gt; then he is mistaken (although not necessarally a liar.)

	I don't know enough WWII history to know how the Nazis were 
attempting to solve the "Jewish Problem" at Dachau, but I hear that 
Belson was a Gas &lt;sorry&gt;

&gt; The Nuremberg Trials...had been popular throughout the world and
&gt; particularly in the United States.  Equally popular was the sentence
&gt; already announced by the high tribunal: death.  But what kind of trial was
&gt; this?  ...The Constitution was not a collection of loosely given political
&gt; promises subject to broad interpretation.  It was not a list of pleasing
&gt; platitudes to be set lightly aside when expediency required it.  It was
&gt; the foundation of the American system of law and justice and [Robert Taft]
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt; was repelled by the picture of his country discarding those Constitutional
&gt; precepts in order to punish a vanquished enemy.

	I wasn't aware that the US Constitution could be applied outside 
the US. 

 	While I understand why you use a remailer, I wish you'd post some 
address that I could send mail to rather than cluttering up the list.
