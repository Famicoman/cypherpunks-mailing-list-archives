And don't forget, if you haven't already - to read Rappoport's interview 
with an ex-juror from the OKC Bombing case, on my website (url below.)

&gt;      
&gt;      Oklahoma City - The Suppressed Truth 
&gt;      By Jon Rappoport
&gt;      Blue Ocean Press
&gt;      2633 Lincoln Blvd., Suite #256
&gt;      Santa Monica, CA 90405
&gt;      (213) 243-9005
&gt;      copyright 1995
&gt;      $12 (post paid)
&gt;      
&gt;      At 9:02 AM on April 19, 1995, the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma 
&gt;      City
&gt;      was damaged in an explosion that also left 168 dead and 600 injured. 
&gt;      If you
&gt;      look closer at this case, as investigative reporter Jon Rappoport has, 
&gt;      you
&gt;      start asking some questions about the "official' story:
&gt;      
&gt;      The damage was supposedly caused when thousands of pounds of a fuel 
&gt;      oil and
&gt;      fertilizer mixture was ignited in a truck parked near the building. 
&gt;      Talk
&gt;      about "oil and water never mixing". This mixture would have to be 
&gt;      either
&gt;      stirred or mixed just before use. It would also have to be detonated 
&gt;      without
&gt;      any air spaces, such as the gaps between the fuel drums, in order to 
&gt;      work.
&gt;      
&gt;      Even if the mixture detonated, it should leave traces of oil. none was 
&gt;      found.
&gt;      
&gt;      Even if it detonated perfectly, the explosion was 3 times too weak to 
&gt;      damage
&gt;      the building's reinforced concrete support columns.
&gt;      
&gt;      Especially column "B3". This column was sheared off at the 3rd floor 
&gt;      level.
&gt;      Only a shaped charge placed directly on the column at that level would 
&gt;      be
&gt;      able to cause this to happen. That section of the column was cut out 
&gt;      and
&gt;      removed as evidence. Will we ever see it again at the trial ?
&gt;      
&gt;      Local seismometers noted *two* explosions, 10 seconds apart. This was 
&gt;      "explained away" as reflections of the explosion by underlying rock 
&gt;      strata.
&gt;      Ask a geologist if this sort of time delay has ever been observed 
&gt;      before you
&gt;      decide if someone is "underlying".
&gt;      
&gt;      What ever happened to "John Doe #2", seen with Tim Mc Veigh that 
&gt;      morning ?
&gt;      
&gt;      What happened to John Doe's #3 and #4, seen leaving the area soon 
&gt;      after the
&gt;      explosion?
&gt;      
&gt;      Speaking of Tim, why (if the official story is true) did he advise the 
&gt;      officer who stopped him that he had a concealed weapon ? Supposedly, 
&gt;      he just
&gt;      killed 168 people, including 19 children. What's one more if it means 
&gt;      he
&gt;      could get away ?
&gt;      
&gt;      And what about Terry Nichols ?
&gt;      He was advocating killing Federal employees at a public meeting in 
&gt;      Estes, CO
&gt;      a year before the bombing. The FBI is very efficient, yet no one seems 
&gt;      to
&gt;      have paid any attention to Terry to prevent loss of life.
&gt;      
&gt;      What about the reported financial links to the bombing, not from right 
&gt;      wing
&gt;      causes, but from the Brittish Government ?
&gt;      
&gt;      Finally, what happens if and when the truth comes out in open court at 
&gt;      Tim
&gt;      and Terry's trial ? One could guess that the real suppressed story 
&gt;      will be
&gt;      one more casualty of the bombing.
&gt;      
&gt;      Unless we demand that someone explains column "B3".
&gt;      
&gt;      It *can* happen here - and it *did* a year ago !
