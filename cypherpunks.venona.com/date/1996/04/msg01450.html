&gt; My scheme is the design of the address database.  It consists of two
&gt; hash tables, one for sending messages (which maps anonymous IDs onto
&gt; sender's addresses), and one for receiving them (mapping recipient's
&gt; addresses onto anonymous IDs).  A cryptographically secure hash (say,
&gt; MD5) is used for the index of both tables.

Funny.  I had the *exact* same idea a couple of months ago.  However, I
did find several flaws in it.

&gt;
&gt; The index of the sending message table is the MD5 hash of the sender's
&gt; address.  The table entry the index points to is the sender's anonymous
&gt; ID, encrypted by a symmetric algorithm (maybe IDEA).  The encryption key
&gt; would be a different hash, by another algorithm (let's suppose it's
&gt; SHA), of that same address.

Perhaps the address could be hashed several times for the table look-up and
then the address could be hashed a less number of times for decryption with
the IDEA key.  This reduces the amount of code needed and also eliminates
any problems with only using 128 bits of SHA output.

&gt;
&gt; In forwarding a message, the server MD5-hashes the sender's address and
&gt; looks at the table.  If it doesn't find a corresponding entry, it
&gt; creates one.  If it *does* find an entry, it SHA-hashes the sender's
&gt; address and uses this key to decrypt the anonymous ID.  In the unlikely
&gt; event of collision the decrypted ID will be gibberish and the server
&gt; does something sensible (like appending padding to the address and
&gt; trying again).  The header information is filtered and the anonymous ID
&gt; inserted in the From: line.

In the scheme I thought of, a password would be sent with the message, which
would be hashed, appended to the hash of the address, and then hashed again
to get the decryption key.

&gt; There is a way that attackers who have seized or copied the database can
&gt; search it - by trying it out on anonymous IDs, or user addresses, until
&gt; they hit paydirt.  And of course such an anonymous server can be no more
&gt; trustworthy than its operator; and the fundamental security limitations of
&gt; the penet-style anonymous server are well-understood.

Searching for the real address behind a pseudonym is not hard at all.  Just
hash the anonymous address, look it up in the table, then decrypt the
cooresponding encrypted address.  This was the major flaw that I spotted with
this scheme.

&gt;
&gt; So what do people think of this scheme of mine?  Are there drawbacks or
&gt; weaknesses that I'm not seeing?  Is it a good idea?  I'd really like it
&gt; if *something* good came out of being laid up with the flu.

The only other problem I found is a pretty minor one: the address database
would be twice as large as it would be if it was stored in plaintext.  I
don't think that much security is gained by using this scheme.
